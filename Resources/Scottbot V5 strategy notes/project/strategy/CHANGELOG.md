# ScottBot V5 – Changelog

## Version: V5 Development Phase (2025-10)

### Added
- Full modular agent architecture (Receptionist → Sub-Agents → Coaching/Master → Data Handling).
- Behavior JSONs for core agents.
- `master_merge_policy.json` and `final_response_schema.json`.
- Test harness (`test_orchestration.js`) and expected outputs.
- Developer guide for GitHub Copilot setup.
- Draft orchestrator (`index.ts`) connecting all agents.

### Updated
- Strategy README cross-linked to changelog.
- Architecture notes refined with V5 agent model.

### Future Direction
- **Ethos Modularity System** (`future_ethos_modularity_note.md`): planned post-V5 enhancement enabling plug-and-play coaching frameworks (ICF, Agile, NLP, and custom). This will allow white-label adaptation of coaching philosophies without altering the core engine.
