# ScottBot V5 – Coaching Agent Notes

## Core Ideas
- Coaching Agent operates under ICF-aligned flows with internal self-audit.
- Audit checks each output for: acknowledgement, projection, open-ended questioning, stacked question violations, closed question use.
- Audit can later be exposed for coach-facing reflection/assessment (future white-label feature).

## Flow Levels (based on ICF credentialing)

### ACC (Associate Certified Coach)
- Structured, supportive coaching.
- Practical interventions and exercises allowed if framed as *options*.
- Clarifications must still be open-ended (e.g., "How helpful would it be if…?").
- Audit leniency: suggestions permitted.

### PCC (Professional Certified Coach)
- Balanced reflective coaching.
- Open-ended prompts emphasized, minimal suggestion (must be framed as optional).
- Clarifications framed as open-ended.
- Audit stricter: projection discouraged, suggestion rare.

### MCC (Master Certified Coach)
- Deepest reflective level.
- Pure presence, curiosity, open-ended inquiry only.
- No projection, no exercises, no suggestions.
- Audit strictest: any directive flagged.

## Universal Rules Across All Levels
- One question at a time (no stacking).
- Only open-ended questions, except permissions reframed as open clarifications.
- Always acknowledge the client’s words before inquiry.
- Tone: curious, reflective, respectful of autonomy.

## Future Extensibility
- Coaching Agent audit traces can be externalized later for session review.
- Possible use case: coach-facing assessment (similar to RaeNotes) integrated into ScottBot white-label version.
- Audit logs could report adherence by level (e.g., 88% MCC-compliant).
