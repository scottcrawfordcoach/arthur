Learning to Listen
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Listening Defined
Actively and warmly receiving, understanding and
accepting another person’s thought patterns,
emotions and reactions, affirmations and doubts…as
they are, for what they are.
Listening is neither agreeing nor disagreeing. It is non-
judgmental and non comparative. It is just simple
reception.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
How do we listen?
IgnoreMost basic, when people have to repeat
what they are saying.
PretendAppearance of listening until we are caught
with a question we can’t answer- results in
an immediate withdrawal from the emotional
bank account of the relationship.
SelectiveIn tune with only parts of the message that
we relate to or identify with -which often
leads to mis-communication and
misunderstanding.
ConsciousPaying attention at the highest level. Focus
and seek the other person’s frame of reference with the intention of kindness and care. Uses listening faculties including heart and mind.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification

ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification

systems

Direct Communication
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Direct Communication start with listening
✦Reframing (shifts)
✦Parroting
✦Acknowledgement
✦Observation
✦Metaphors (next week)
Parroting
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
How conversation works
We are deafened by a wall of assumptions
and preoccupations created by what we
do or do not pay attention to. It prevents us
from clearly hearing what another
person is saying.
Parroting
helps us
dismantle the
wall.  To
refrain from
assuming
heard what
was
important to
that person.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
We see the world as WE are
1st lady: “Windy, isn’t it?”
2nd lady: “No, it’s Thursday.”
1st lady:  “So am I. Let’s get a cup of tea.”
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Parroting= Clean listening
Coachee:
Im having such a hard time coping with my husbands absence since he took the job overseas. He is away 3
months at a time and I miss him so much. Coach:
I heard “cope,” tell me more about that?
Assumes nothing.
Echos and checks for meaning.
Clarifies and expands on meaning.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Parrot beliefs, attitudes, values, feelings
Listen for words that point to perspective or filters.
Echo one or two key words followed by a question.
Example:
I’m hearing ‘frustrated’, what does that mean to you?
OR
‘Frustrated’, what does frustrated mean in this situation?
When you add context, interpretation, speculation or opinion you are
assuming you know what is important to that person!
Parroting, not paraphrasing
Acknowledgement
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Holding others in positive regard
Acknowledgement is appreciating a person’s inherent value. The point
isn’t their accomplishments.
It’s their worth as a human being.
Recognition is about what people do.
Appreciation is about their impact on you.
Acknowledgement  is for them and about them, who they are!
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
SMART Acknowledgement
Acknowledgement is a simple, meaningful statement of
what you witness is relevant & true. Authenticity is key!
Simple
Meaningful
Acknowledgement
Relevant True
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
What does acknowledgement sound like?
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Recognize, Honor, Acknowledge
I want to acknowledge you for your efforts…. your
journey…. your thoughtfulness….
I admire your intentions for “X” and want to acknowledge
you for your commitment… your energy… your desire…
I see how much you care…. how important this is to
you….. how far you’ve come….
I hear how much this means to you … how much you
want this….Offering acknowledgement in coaching sounds like:
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification

Observations
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Observation = Feedback-Emotion
Information offered in the context of self improvement; often calls
attention to ones blind-spots, from an objective point of view.
# Is Is Not

ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Conscious Incompetence
Unconscious incompetence: I don’t know what I don’t know.
Change happens in Conscious Incompetence.
Awareness can be uncomfortable!
Observation creates awareness around the distinction
between intention and impact. As we judge ourselves for our good
intentions, yet we are judged by others for our impact.

ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Observation Sandwich: P.O.P
1- Permission: the “knock” before you enter
May I…., do you mind…, is it ok if…. do I have your permission to…
2- Observation: objective feedback (avoid interpretations)
State what you hear, see, or sense and any connections, threads,
inconsistencies, challenges
3- Partner: invite agreement or disagreement
What do you think?
Does that ﬁt?
How are “x” and “y” connected
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Observation sounds like…
P:   May I share something with you?


Sure ,OK.
O:  I’m hearing the word sorry often, like  for example 3 times in the
       last few minutes.
P:   What do you think?
Really? I’m sorry! Oops! I mean really?!
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Observation sounds like…
P:   Do you mind if I share an observation?


Of course.
O:  I heard earlier you mentioned guilt and now I’m hearing sad.
P:   How might guilt and sad be connected?

Introduction to Metaphor
Coach Selfie
Best “Coach Selﬁe” Exercise
Recall the “Coach In Your Life” exercise we did. Think back to the person in your
life that you felt special, uplifted or conﬁdent with.
Write down the positive traits you notice in that person?
(eg. kind, pa tient, affectionate…)
1. _________________________________________________________
2. _________________________________________________________
3. _________________________________________________________4. _________________________________________________________5. _________________________________________________________6. _________________________________________________________
Now think about your best-self, or your authentic self. What are your most cherished traits- the ones you love about yourself, and others love about you? It can be hard to be kind to ourselves, we don’t all sit around thinking about how great we are- it’s not typical human nature. Take this opportunity to really see yourself and appreciate yourself.
Write down your best-self traits here:
(eg. fair, approachable, reliable, inspiring…)
1. _________________________________________________________2. _________________________________________________________3. _________________________________________________________4. _________________________________________________________5. _________________________________________________________6. _________________________________________________________
