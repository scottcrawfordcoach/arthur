Hey - That’s NEAT!
Hi Scott,
Have you heard of EAT and NEAT with regard to metabolism?
EAT is Exercise Activity Thermogenesis - basically generating heat by expending energy
during intentional exercise. A run, a cycle, lifting weights etc.
NEAT is Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis - generating heat by expending energy during
incidental activities. This could be many things; fidgeting, walking to the bathroom, brushing
teeth etc.
Trying to burn calories to lose weight by exercising hard is not impossible, but it’s generally
considered a sub-optimal approach.
Strength training still has its place - muscle tissue burns more calories just to exist, the
mitochondria in muscle tissue is where much of the body’s energy is produced, and simply
being stronger and with better functional movement means that we’ll have a higher NEAT
simply because it’s easier to move and thus, not such a chore to do things.

The body is aggressively homeostatic, meaning it will do everything it can to maintain the
current status quo.
One of the main ways it does this is by offsetting the energy demands of vigorous exercise by
down-regulating your NEAT.
You may fidget just a little less, lean on walls when standing, doze in a chair - any tiny little
thing the body can do to claw back those calories throughout the day. It may also keep you
just a little cooler, make you think a little slower, and drive up your appetite.
Since even an extremely athletic person might only burn up to 30% or so of daily calories
from deliberate exercise, NEAT makes up a bigger component of the total daily energy
expenditure.
This makes it a difficult system to overcome, but also a powerful lever we can pull.
When we are looking for sustainable long-term fat loss, it’s a case of clawing back just a few
tens of calories here and there without the body noticing - small exclusions from our diet and
lots of gentle aerobic exercise to burn fat, but not drive a big recovery response.
Low volume heavy lifts in the gym can be useful to help maintain muscle tissue without
excess fatigue.
Increase your NEAT with small adjustments to your routine; take the stairs, park farther from
the store, keep your shoes upstairs! I keep my toothbrush in the basement bathroom, so
every time I use it, I need to do 2 flights of stairs!
Don’t try to beat your body into submission by exhausting yourself - it almost always wins.
Get sneaky!

Food for the BODY
I love pomegranates! They are tasty
and a nutritional powerhouse. However,
they’re fairly expensive and almost
impossible to peel without the place
looking like a murder scene!
I recently discovered frozen
pomegranate arils at the local grocery
store for less than $5.
I enjoy eating them frozen as a treat,
and not only is there no fuss, but they
stay fresh.
I have become a fan of frozen fruit in
general. Our fruit in the store can often
be surprisingly old (even over a year for
apples), whereas frozen fruit may have
been bagged only hours after picking.
Fruit loses nutritional quality over time,
so frozen can be a great option.

Food for the SOUL
Don’t think for a moment that because
you feel fear that you’re not brave. It’s a
perfectly natural response to risky
situations. It keeps us alive.
Courage is when we feel fear, but face
the risk and try anyway.
Without fear, there can be no courage.

Food for THOUGHT
This week was Family Day. Remember
that social connection is one of the
most powerful indicators of longevity.
Being physically fit or slim does not
NECESSARILY mean healthy - health
is a complex mix of lifestyle factors.
Nothing comes for free - if our
relationships suffer because of our
other health goals, we might need to
tweak our priorities to address the
balance, or potentially end up LESS
healthy from a holistic point of view.

Food for the BRAIN
Did you know the idea of walking 10,000
steps per day came from a 1960s
Japanese pedometer whose name literally
translated as “10,000 Steps Meter”
That number was picked because the
Japanese character for 10,000 vaguely
resembled a person walking.
It really has no measured basis in
physiology; however, it correlates
reasonably well with the WHO goal of 150
minutes of moderately vigorous physical
activity per week.
