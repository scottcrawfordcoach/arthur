Hi Scott,
T h e 	 P a r a d o x 	 o f 	 P r o g r e s s
Running might be the most democratic form of exercise there is. No team. No court. No
complicated gear. Just a pair of shoes and a willingness to move forward. In theory, it’s one of the
easiest ways to start getting fit. In practice? It’s one of the hardest.
That’s the paradox.
Running is simple, but not easy. It looks accessible, but often feels out of reach.That feeling - that
distance between what we imagine and what we experience - is where many people lose
momentum. We don’t just want to move, we want to feel like we’re “running.”  We want to belong
to the identity of a runner,  and when the reality involves walk breaks, burning lungs, or an
awkward shuffle that doesn’t match the highlight reel in our head, we question whether we’re
doing it right.
Cycling doesn’t suffer from quite the same identity gap. While there are vast differences in speed,
power, and experience, a beginner who gets on a bike and pedals is still "cycling." There’s no need
to reach a certain pace or form to feel like a participant. With running, though, the early stages

can feel like you're falling short of the label itself, even when you're doing exactly what your body
needs to adapt.
But what if the problem isn’t us? What if the problem is the idea that progress should feel
dramatic? What if we stopped defining success by how hard something is, and started measuring
it by how likely we are to do it again tomorrow?
Progress isn’t made in heroic sprints. It’s made in measured steps. And sometimes, the most
disciplined thing we can do is to go a little easier than we want to. Because growth doesn’t
require suffering. It requires consistency.
Moderation can feel boring. It doesn’t always get the praise or the podium. But it’s where
sustainable progress lives.  Ironically, learning to moderate even our moderation - to know when
to push and when to pull back - is the real art of growth.

Food for the BODY
“ I n c l u d i n g 	 M o d e r a t i o n ”
Moderation is a smart strategy until it
becomes a straightjacket.
Sometimes, in our effort to stay balanced,
we end up stuck. Eating *just enough* to
keep things steady, but never quite enough
to feel nourished. Living in the middle can
feel safe, but it can also quietly stall
progress.
That’s why even moderation needs
moderation.
In nutrition, one example is the 	 “ d i e t
b r e a k ” -  a deliberate period of eating at
maintenance after a sustained calorie
deficit. It’s not a “cheat” or a loss of
discipline, it’s a strategy. One that can8/12/25, 10:51 AM Gmail - Everything In Moderation - Including Moderation

support hormonal balance, preserve
muscle mass, improve mood and sleep,
and make long-term fat loss more
sustainable.
It’s also a psychological reset. When you
spend too long in restriction, even
moderate restriction, food can start to feel
transactional. A diet break reminds your
body and your brain that food is fuel, not
just math.

So many of us are wired for extremes.
We’re either training hard or doing
nothing. Eating perfectly or eating
whatever. Hustling or quitting. All-in or
all-out.
But what if growth doesn’t live in the
extremes? What if it lives in the in-
between?
When we let go of b i n a r y 	 t h i n k i n g, we
open up a world of sustainable options. It
becomes okay to walk instead of run. To
train for 20 minutes instead of 60. To eat
well most of the day and still enjoy
dessert.
Letting go of perfection doesn’t mean
giving up. It means making room for
progress that actually sticks.

Pause for thought:  Where in your life are
you mistaking intensity for commitment?

Physiologically, growth happens when we
stress the system j u s t 	 e n o u g h to stimulate
adaptation, but not so much that we can't
recover.
This applies to strength, cardio,
metabolism, even your nervous system.
Too little challenge, and nothing changes.
Too much, and the body resists or breaks
down.
The sweet spot might be called the
"Goldilocks zone": not too hard, not too
easy.
It’s not just physical. Emotional and
cognitive growth follow a similar curve.
You grow when you're challenged, but not
overwhelmed.
So if you want to grow, ask yourself: “Is
this enough to move me forward without
breaking me down?”

We live in a culture that celebrates
pushing through. That applauds burnout
and lionizes the grind.
The truth is, you don’t have to break
yourself to grow as a person. You don’t
have to chase discomfort every day to be
worthy of progress.
You can go gently. You can move steadily.
You can make peace with the pace you can
keep.
Because what matters most isn’t how fast
you grow. It’s that you’re still becoming.
