REST and DIGEST
Hi Scott,
I’ve had a lot of conversations recently about poor sleep.
It seems that for whatever reasons, a lot of people (me included) are experiencing disrupted
or shortened sleep. Perhaps it’s the disruptive influence of our uncertain world or the clocks
changing. Whatever the cause, the situation I’m presented with most is people missing
workouts due to disrupted sleep, or directly asking me whether they should still exercise if
they didn’t sleep well.
I did quite a bit of digging around this, and I found quite a considered summary from Dr.
Andrew Huberman.
The short answer seems to be YES. If you have a bad sleep, then exercise appears to be
effective at mitigating the negative effects of that during the day, and increases the chances of
a better sleep the next night.
I also notice that when people are able to keep their exercise habit up, it can help stop a
single disrupted night from spreading its unsettling  influence farther into the following day or
beyond.
Whenever our routine is disrupted, it’s always good to try to draw a line under it immediately
and move on as normal.
There are some caveats.

If you know that you are chronically under-rested, and you have the chance to catch up on
sleep, then it might be best to take advantage of that opportunity. However, if you are awake
anyway, tossing and turning, then the chances are, it’s going to be worth showing up to the
gym.
We need to be sensible and realistic about our exercise choices on a day following poor
sleep.
There are studies correlating fatigue and injury risk, and pushing really hard in the gym while
sleep deprived is a good way to invite illness, pain, or reduced motivation to show up next
time.
My recommendation after a bad sleep is to still exercise, at your usual time if you can, and be
sure to use that as a recovery day - focus on healthy movement, rather than heavy lifting - it’s
not the time for setting records.
I always try to be adaptable with my programming to allow people to turn down the intensity
when needed.
If you don’t feel up to your usual routine, or your gym of choice doesn’t offer a flexible
approach, I recommend using your usual exercise time to take a walk outdoors, preferably in
as natural a setting as possible.

Food for the BRAIN
Did you know that a 2023 study
demonstrated that isometric (holding a
fixed position) exercise - in particular,
the humble wall sit - was most effective
at lowering both systolic and diastolic
blood pressure at rest, following a
training period of several weeks?
This is when compared to HIIT, Aerobic
Cardio, Resistance Exercise and
Combined Training (weights and
cardio).
That might seem counter-intuitive, but
often, electively stressing a body
system in a measured way, followed by
adequate recovery, is the way to
develop adaptations in that system.

Food for the SOUL
Don’t worry about whether you’re doing
it right, or often enough, or long
enough, or fast enough.
The first steps you take will be the most
important - literally.

Food for THOUGHT
For all of us, the day will come when
we're not around any more.
What do you want your life to have
meant?
What do you want people to say about
you as they remember you?
To what extent are your behaviours and
choices TODAY in service of that
memory?
We write our history in the present.

Food for the BODY
Aside from broadly accepting that ultra-
processed foods with lots of additives are
generally not ideal, let’s get away from
using overly-simplistic terms like “healthy”
or “unhealthy” regarding foods.
Food is fuel. It provides STRUCTURE and
ENERGY for the body.
We can think about a food choice in terms
of how it supports our goals.
What is your intuitive sense of what food
types are good choices for you right now,
versus those which are not in service of
your desired outcomes?

Spring!
We are getting so close to having the doors
open in the gym!
We’ve managed a few sessions so far on
warmer days, but within a week or two, we
should be fully opened up.
This means we can begin to diversify our
workouts again, make use of the outdoor
space and for the early birds - enjoy the
sunset.
Did someone say Blaze Pods?!
