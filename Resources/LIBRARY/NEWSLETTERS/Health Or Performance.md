HEALTH or PERFORMANCE?
Hi Scott,
In Simon Sinek's book "The Infinite Game," he outlines the idea that we often, as individuals
and as a society, approach processes in a finite way.
In that, we approach it like a sports game, where there are set rules, a defined playing area,
and the point of the game is to WIN - trying to be RIGHT.
Unfortunately, many of the aspects of our lives are more chaotic - they have non-defined
playing areas and rules, and people drop in and out of the game randomly - an infinite game.
The point of an infinite game is to PLAY FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN.
Education, Business, Politics, Friendship, Health, Marriage.
These are all infinite games.
If we treat these as a zero sum game with a winner and a loser, we might 'win' today, but find
that eventually, no-one wants to play with us any more. Or we're in too much pain to go on.
Most of us are probably familiar with the idea of SMART goals (Specific, Measurable,
Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound), but before we get to setting SMART goals or any

other structure to define our progress and achievement, we need to understand which type of
game we're playing.
When it comes to fitness, if our goal is PERFORMANCE, then we start with a very single-
purposed position on how the various aspects of our lives are balanced. We put winning
ahead of almost all else. Performance goals tend to be part of a finite game.
If our goal is to be HEALTHY, then we need to take a much more measured and balanced
approach, and appreciate that our health has different components, which all contribute to our
overall wellness. Health goals tend to be part of an infinite game.
My focus is really on Health goals.
Of course we can punctuate a health journey with mini finite goals and milestones along the
way, but always keep a focus on a holistic view and the need to live to fight another day.
It's a dance between accepting that we will not be able to bring our full power to every
session, but also developing robust, disciplined habits that sustain us through periods of low
energy and motivation.

Remember your recovery.
Remember that we DO NOT get
stronger and fitter in the gym, or at the
track, or on the trail, or on the field.
In those places, we provide the
stimulus for adaptation.
We get stronger and fitter when we rest
and recover.
You WILL NOT improve your fitness by
just pushing harder and harder - that is8/12/25, 10:52 AM Gmail - HEALTH or PERFORMANCE

Let the silence hang.
Don’t rush to fill every moment of
silence with sound.
Give people a moment to gather their
thoughts, and fight the urge to speak
first.
The ability to resist the temptation to
tell the world what we think we know
demonstrates poise and confidence.
The space we often call an “awkward
pause” might just be the moment that
the person we are talking to was about
to share something deep, profound,
interesting or useful.
This is something I practice routinely in
coaching sessions, and it’s a work in
progress to bring it more often to my
time supervising in the gym, and to
everyday conversation.
Judge it like a hug; it’s ok for it to sit
long enough that it’s just short of

Consistency, consistency,
consistency.
I return to this point again and again
and again.
Our body shape and our health is a
product of our genetics and our habits.
Our habits - not our exceptional
behaviours.
The little choices we make every day.
Not the cool stuff we once did.
Not the big plans we have for the
future.
Not the promises we make to ourselves
and others.
Always opt to do what you can in the
moment, rather than let perfection be
the enemy of good.

Quinoa.
Did you know that quinoa is really a seed,
not a true grain?
It is an excellent choice to consider in
place of rice or cous cous, as it is higher in
fibre and other nutrients, and contains a8/12/25, 10:52 AM Gmail - HEALTH or PERFORMANCE
