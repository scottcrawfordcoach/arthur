That’s Not What I Hoped For….
Hi Scott,
In both running and hiking, I have a lot of issues working around old injuries. It can be difficult
(and expensive!) trying to find the right footwear combination to match my needs for a given
activity.
In the last couple of weeks, I’ve had some discomfort in different parts of my foot, so I haven’t
been able to train in the way I’d hoped or planned for.
It’s frustrating for me because I have certain training goals I’m trying to meet, and more
importantly, I really need big days in the outdoors to keep me sane.
That, combined with increased administrative workload (not where my strengths lie!), means
that I’ve wasted more hours recently than I’d like, sulking!
In times like these, I always strive to draw a figurative line in the sand with my toe (one of the
working ones) and step over it. Take stock of the situation as I find it, and figure out what I’m
going to do about it. What’s in my control?
I’ve found some ways to offload tasks that can be done by others, and while it’s not as
satisfying as summiting a mountain, I’ve adapted to spend some more time on the bike
trainer.
I make this more fun using the Rouvy app. This lets me cycle through some real scenery,
and is a big improvement on my basement wall!

As much as you can, focus on playing the hand you’re dealt, rather than lose time lamenting
the one you’d hoped for.

Food for the BODY
Lactose intolerance in Mongolia..
It’s interesting that Mongolian people
as a population have a very high
incidence of lactose intolerance -
somewhere around 95% - but yet their
diet has a lot of dairy in it.
So what’s the story? Dairy was eaten
long before there was a large dairy
industry or refrigeration.
This means much of the dairy food in
their diet is fermented - the bacteria
break down the Lactose, and so the
trait for expressing the enzyme Lactase
has never become prevalent in the
population.
Yoghurts, kefirs and sharp cheeses can
often be more easily tolerated by
people who are sensitive to Lactose.
Check out this short video on the
Mongolian drink Airag - would you try
it?!8/12/25, 10:53 AM Gmail - That's not what I hoped for.....

Food for the SOUL
It is human nature to complete the story
by embellishing the facts we have with
calculated assumptions to fill in the
gaps.
It is also human nature to make that
story centre around ourselves.
Fun fact - when we feel like people are
judging us, chances are they’re thinking
about themselves!
Examples include:
Everyone in the gym is thinking I’m
weak and clumsy——->Everyone else
is feeling the same, or is more
concerned about their day ahead.
Everyone is thinking this outfit is awful -
------> Everyone else is focused on
their own worries and not that
interested in my clothing choice!

Food for THOUGHT
If you had to choose Strong or Thin,
what would it be?
Subcutaneous fat - the stuff we see - is
generally a safe place for our body to
store energy for times when food
becomes scarce.
There IS a threshold where that
storage becomes a problem, and that
threshold is unique for everyone. We
can’t be sure from a person’s looks
how metabolically healthy they are,
necessarily.
Our ratio of lean mass to fat mass has
implications for our health.
If I had to choose for myself, I’d take
strong over skinny, any day.
I would choose to store a little extra
and have it supported by functional
muscle tissue and a healthy
metabolism, rather than be thin and
under-muscled.
How about you?

Food for the BRAIN
What’s the buzz around Creatine?
Creatine is a naturally occurring organic
compound derived from 3 amino acids,
produced by the body in relatively small
amounts and found in meats and fish.
It has been exhaustively studied for
decades now and generally considered to
be very safe as a supplement.
The Creatine Phosphate system is a
biochemical mechanism which restores the
immediate-demand energy supply in our
muscles, used for things like sprinting or
lifting heavy weights.
Having a topped-up creatine ‘pool’ can
allow a little more output in our training,
meaning faster progress if used in the right
way.
Many of our common modern illnesses
and conditions might be considered a
function of dysregulated energy distribution
in the body, making Creatine of wider
interest than just for strength training.
Some interesting results are coming to
light from studies involving cognition,
recovery from brain injuries, and also
supporting SSRI use.
While I wouldn’t make a blanket
recommendation that people use Creatine,
I DO believe it is worth researching to
make your own choice.
