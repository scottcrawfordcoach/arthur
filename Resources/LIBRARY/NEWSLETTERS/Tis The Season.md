‘Tis The Season
Hi Scott,
The festive season is practically upon us. It can be a complicated time, full of paradoxes.
A time of abandon and joy , and guilt
A time of connection and excitement, and exhaustion
A time of hope and expectation, and yet occasional underwhelm
A time of good intentions and broken promises
Navigating a complex time like this requires nuance.
At the core of healthy choices is the idea of delayed gratification - healthy choices generally involve being
able to put of f indulging our every whim.

However , if you have been telling yourself that you ‘must’  get around to making changes, I suggest that
the last two weeks of the year are not the time for trying to do that with something new . We are simply
bombarded with too many temptations and opportunities to leap of f the wagon at every turn! New Year’s
resolutions come with their own problems, but a new year is also a great opportunity for a fresh start.
If you already have a pretty well-managed routine that you are happy with, then two weeks of debauchery
will not completely undo your metabolic flexibility or your fitness, or wither away your muscles. In fact,
both ‘diet breaks’  and reduced training periods can be an important part of progress. However , it might be
helpful to set a date for getting back to ‘normal’.
Have a wonderful holiday season,
Scott

Food for the BODY
Walking, walking, walking.
I can’t think of a better holiday exercise.
Walking after a meal helps control blood
sugar . It’s non-threatening enough that we
can do it with a full belly or a hangover!
It is great for burning fat. It’ s social. It gets us
out in nature.
Just walk as much as you can, and enjoy it -
don’t view it as a chore.
If it’s icy out, I recommend using a set of
spikes on your shoes like these . Choose
some with both heel and forefoot spikes.

Food for the SOUL
There is more to a healthy life than caloric
restriction and interval training.
Give yourself permission to embrace some
excesses that bring you joy and closer to
others over the holidays.
Ask Me A Question
Food for THOUGHT
If you find yourself stressing over getting
everything just “perfect” for family or other
guests, pause to consider; “how is this about
what they expect of me, versus what I
expect of myself?”
What is it that your guests actually need for
them to feel welcome and relaxed?

Food for the BRAIN
If you are hoping to exercise some restraint
during the festive season, always have a
plan.
The part of our brain that smells and sees
food will operate much faster than the part
which calculates “no - I’d better not!”
We can pre-load a situational response to
shortcut that process.
Like a piece of code, ready to run.
For example, if we are going out for dinner:
If/when the server asks if I’d like to see
the desserts - I will say “I’ll just have a
coffee, thanks.”
