New Season, New Offerings!
Hi Scott,
First off—thank you for your patience! It’s been a little while since my last newsletter, and I
appreciate you sticking with me. The good news is, the silence has been for a great reason.
Summer is almost upon us, and for the new season, I’ve been working behind the scenes on
something new - I’m excited to finally share it with you. I will be launching a brand-new
website and coaching packages that will expand the coaching side of my work. This has been
a long time coming, and I’m eager to show you what’s ahead.
If you’ve trained with me before, you know I believe real progress isn’t just physical - it’s
deeply personal. That’s where coaching comes in. Coaching creates the space to reflect,
build clarity, and intentionally move toward the life you want - inside and outside the gym. It’s
the work that supports everything else.
And just to be clear - my Synergize Group Training classes aren’t going anywhere! They’ll
continue to run as usual, so no need to worry. Those of you who train in person can still count
on our regular sessions together, with the same blend of knowledge, care and sass!
Stay tuned for more updates.
Scott

Food for the BRAIN
Did you know that exercise can
literally change your brain? Just 20
minutes of moderate aerobic
movement—like brisk walking, cycling,
or dancing—can boost levels of brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a
protein that supports learning, memory,
and emotional regulation. It’s like
fertilizer for your brain.
But the benefits go beyond short-term
mental clarity. Higher BDNF levels have
also been linked to lower risk of
neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. In fact,
regular physical activity is one of the
most well-supported lifestyle factors for
protecting long-term brain health.
So if you're feeling foggy,
overwhelmed, or just flat—try moving
your body first. Clarity, mood, and long-
term resilience often follow.

Resilience Isn’t Rigid
It’s easy to mistake rigidity for strength.8/12/25, 10:52 AM Gmail - New Season, New Offerings!

To stand tall, brace hard, and resist
whatever comes - like iron.
But pushed hard enough, iron snaps.
Real resilience is different. It isn’t about
resisting everything. It’s about
adapting, shifting and recovering.
It’s knowing when to push back, and
when to duck.
When to show up, and when to rest.
When to hold your ground, and when to
move.
It’s more like hard rubber than brittle
iron.
Strong, yes, but flexible. Responsive.
Honest.
Because resilience isn’t about never
breaking.
It’s about coming back, again and
again, with purpose and grace

Food for THOUGHT
The Safety of Holding Back
There’s a certain safety in not really
trying.
When we hold something back, we
protect ourselves. If we fail, we can
say, “I could’ve done more.” It softens
the blow.
But what happens when we give it
everything?
It’s riskier. We’re more exposed. But
there’s an honesty in that.
We can not only learn from failure and
adapt, but there’s pride to be found in
it.
Celebrate your wins, but if you
genuinely gave it your all, be most
proud of your failures - that’s when you
know you had no more to give.
Sometimes, the real achievement isn’t
the outcome - it’s the choice to go all in.

Can Kiwifruit Help You Sleep?
Surprisingly, yes, it seems.
Several studies have found that eating two
kiwifruit about an hour before bed can improve
sleep quality—especially in people who
struggle to fall or stay asleep.
Participants in one study fell asleep faster,8/12/25, 10:52 AM Gmail - New Season, New Offerings!

slept longer, and woke less often. Another trial
found that even powdered or dried kiwi
improved ease of waking and boosted sleep-
related hormone markers.
Researchers suggest this effect may come
from kiwi’s natural antioxidants, serotonin
precursors, and high vitamin C content—all of
which support nervous system function and
sleep regulation.
It’s not a magic bullet—but it might be a simple,
food-first way to support better rest.
Easy to try, easy to stick with. Just add two
kiwifruit to your evening routine and see how
you feel.
