The Ups & Downs of New Year’s Resolutions
Hi Scott,
I hope you’re having a wonderful holiday season so far . I’m sure that while many of us are in the throes of
festive celebration, others are looking to the New Year for resolutions they might make.
New Year, New You? New Year can be a tricky time.
On one hand, it is very easy to jump on the bandwagon of ill-conceived resolutions and hollow promises,
fueled by the guilt of over-indulgence. On the other , beginning a new journey around the sun and a fresh
year planner can be a great opportunity to make some changes.
Most New Year’s resolutions go unfulfilled.
The path to success lies within success itself - every broken promise to ourselves is a vote for the camp
that says we can’t do hard things.

Improve your chances by planning carefully . Our sense of self-belief and self-ef ficacy builds with every
win (however small), and so we can build on our achievements over time.
Be clear about WHY  you are making a change and be sure it makes sense.
If your goal is to give up alcohol for a month, great. But WHY? If it’ s to get healthier , then health-wise, that
month is practically an irrelevance if your intention is to go right back to the usual habits - just a blip on
the graph of your life. However , if the goal is simply to prove to yourself that you can, then great. Be sure
to think about how that might evolve going forwards.
In pursuit of a healthier lifestyle, a better goal might be to commit to a small reduction - FOREVER!
In any case, if you judge your chances of success at less than 8/10, then augment the conditions until
they are at least that.
If you are new to this sort of challenge, or you’ve found them dif ficult in the past, I recommend tackling it
from a position of abundance, rather than restriction. Fill your life with something new that you’re excited
about - maybe read a book a month, try a new recipe each week or join an exercise group ;-)
This is likely to be less painful than trying to deny yourself something you currently rely on, and it is
possible to crowd out the ‘bad’  with the ‘good’  to some extent..
Think about who can support you.
Good luck, and Happy New Year!
Scott

Food for the BODY
Rx Bars - I recently tried these bars and I
really enjoy them. They’re tasty and full of
mostly whole ingredients (just some
powdered egg white added). They’re not as
high in protein as others, but I appreciate the
fairly clean ingredient list and taste of these.
The cheapest source I’ve found is Costco,
but Amazon  have them. My favourite is
chocolate and sea salt. I now always take
some of these hiking with me.

Food for the SOUL
“A day filled with half-done things is still a
productive day”
I blurted out this phrase during a
conversation with another coach recently
and thought “hey - I like that!”
It’s definitely more satisfying to get things of f
the to-do list, but doing work in service of
that process is never wasted.
The world has a way of getting in the way
when we’re in the middle of something - go
easy on yourself, and celebrate the work you
did on the half-finished stuf f!

Food for THOUGHT
Consider:
What is one aspect of your character
that limits your progress in some
way?
How would you like that to be
different?
How does it also work FOR you?

Food for the BRAIN
Some Cholesterol Facts you might not know:
There is no “good” or “bad” cholesterol -
it’s the same molecule, transported in
different lipoproteins.(Inc. HDL  & LDL)
The cholesterol in food has little impact
on serum levels - it’ s not well absorbed.
Saturated fat intake CAN af fect serum
cholesterol levels.
Almost every cell in the body can make
its own cholesterol.
Accepted convention is that
cardiovascular risk is driven primarily by
the NUMBER of LDL  particles, rather
than the total amount of cholesterol.
It’s generally thought to be preferable to
have a smaller number of larger LDL
particles.
Our lifestyle and metabolic health can
have an impact on particle type
