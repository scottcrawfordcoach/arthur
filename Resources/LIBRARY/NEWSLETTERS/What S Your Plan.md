What’ s Your Plan?
Hi Scott,
What does it mean to be fit? How do we know when a person becomes fit? Certainly , we can see outward
signs if someone is very unfit, and there are metrics we can track to follow progress, but at what point do
we suddenly transition from “unfit” to “fit?”
The reality is, that's a subjective question, and it will depend greatly on our individual goals. Fit for what?
That’ s why a destination and a structured process can be important.
Remember that progress is rarely linear , and in a long-term process, often we can work hard in the
moment but with no tangible reward - yet.
If you find that your physical health has slipped, think back - if you could revert to a previous version of
yourself, when would that be? If you’re over 40 like me, I’m guessing years ago!
That gradual creep of years will not be undone with a few intense bursts of ef fort - we need to make
small, lasting course changes to turn that ship around. This is why my training groups are not short
courses, but run indefinitely .

Food for the BODY
Whole foods, when consumed, will actually
prompt the body to regulate hunger and
satiety hormones. Junk food is often
perfectly curated to undermine this process -
high in energy (which can be stored as fat),
but low in nutrients, leaving the body still
looking to fulfill its needs. I’ve found I can
fairly readily  judge foods’  nutritional value
by the “am I full?” test . Something like
chips are a bottomless pit for me, but if I eat
say, eggs, I generally know right away when
I’ve had enough.
What’ s your “can’t stop” food?
Once you’ve identified these foods, one of
the best strategies is to simply not have
them in the house.  If this isn’t possible due
to other family members’  choices, or
because they were purchased in a moment
of weakness, then always be sure to
measure a portion into a dish , rather than
sit with the bag.

Food for the SOUL
I think it’ s quite common for us to carry a
burden of shame when our physical fitness
has perhaps lessened in some way over
time.
While I know that physical health is critically
important, we must be mindful of the fact
that many things contribute to our overall
well being.
Two of the most powerful indicators of
long-term wellbeing are Social
Connections and Socio-Economic Status.
If your physical fitness has slipped
somewhat, having invested much of your
time and energy into furthering your career
or raising a family , then remember; you have
NOT  been neglecting your overall well
being. In fact, I congratulate you.
Of course, we also need to be physically fit
enough to manage those demands.
My work revolves around addressing that
balance.

Food for THOUGHT
Most of us are familiar with the process of
planning for an upcoming project or
opportunity , or training for a sporting event,
but how many of us apply that same strategy
to other areas of our lives?
Perhaps it’ s a new child, or a new job or
promotion, with increased hours and
responsibilities.
Those responsibilities eat into our time
and energy , making self-care almost
impossible. The cruel irony is that in order
to meet these new challenges, and perform
our best for a long time, we’re going to need
to be physically and mentally robust;
perhaps like never before.
If you have something new on the horizon,
consider trying to work in some new habits
BEFORE the event, rather than add them to
the mix once the madness begins.

Food for the BRAIN
Did you know that “micro workouts” or
“exercise snacking” is a thing?
Full, regular workouts are the ideal solution,
but for those who have a very hectic
schedule, breaking exercise up into tiny
packets can be very ef fective, provided they
are intense and frequent enough.
These can be as little as 20 seconds. You
might choose zooming up and down the
stairs (carefully!) or squat jumps in place.
We can spike the heart rate briefly , without
getting super sweaty at work.
Slightly longer sessions might involve a little
mini circuit, or a 5 minute walk.
A great model would be to choose 3
exercises. For example:
10 Bodyweight Squats
10 Pushups (hands on desk if you
can’t do floor push ups)
10 V-Ups
Do this set once every half hour or so, or
perhaps set a timer for 5 minutes, and do
one round every minute on the minute,
repeated occasionally throughout the day .
Mix it up from day to day to keep things
interesting, but keep it up!

Last Chance!
While anyone is free to try out my gym, I
don’t usually host events where everyone is
just trying out, rather than joining an
established group.
It can be daunting to join in with more
experienced clients, so if this trial session is
appealing to you, sign up!
