Get Excited!
Hi Scott,
It has been a joy to welcome new members
to our gym community this past month! As
the community grows, we keep getting better
and better . I am hosting a FREE TRIAL
SESSION on T uesday 29th October at
4pm for any of you who haven’t been here in
a while or those you know who may be
interested in checking it out. It’ll be an
opportunity for people to try out my small
group training with no commitment required,
in a room with others new to Synergize
Coaching, rather than jumping right into an
existing group.
If you are not currently an active client, and
you are in Kingston and would like to try it
out, click here. If you have any friends or
family who you think might like to try it out,
please forward this to them or sign them up
here.
**Remember , any existing clients who
recommend a friend, will receive a half price
month if that person signs up for a month.

You may have noticed that my logo is a
series of twisted, swooping colours.
To me it represents muscle fibres, a state of
flow, but most importantly , it also represents
the dif ferent aspects of our wellbeing, and
how they are inextricably linked. It is my goal
to help navigate the relationships between
them, rather than simply give out
information.

Food for the BODY
If we’re trying to eat healthily , and
particularly if we’re trying to lose excess
body fat, it’ s important to eat nutrient dense
foods to keep us feeling full, and to ensure
our bodies get the nutrition they need
without a large caloric load.
A rough, but really handy way to assess the
nutritional value of a Carbohydrate product
is to divide the TOTAL CARBOHYDRA TE
number by the FIBRE number on the
nutrition label. If it’ s 7 or less, then it’ s great.
If it’s much over 10, then eat sparingly or
treat it as a dessert.
A multigrain artisan loaf might be 27g Total
Carbs to 4g Fibre, compared with plain white
bread with 39g Total Carbs to 1g Fibre.
Examine some next time you’re in the store.

Food for the SOUL
I have to disagree with Master Yoda on this
one (pretty arrogant, right?) ;-)
Simply “doing” is the path of staying right
where we are.
Don’t be afraid to try new things, push your
limits and risk a real chance of failure. That’ s
the path of improvement; never feel bad that
it’s imperfect. This is why I continually push
the idea of “show up and do what you can.”
That’ s growth. That’ s training.
You’re doing (trying) great!
Are you ready to try something dif ferent
even if it’ s not done perfectly?

Food for THOUGHT
We are social animals, and having healthy
relationships is critically related to our
physical health. Developing our
communication skills is a key component of
fostering strong relationships.
This involves real listening and asking the
right type of questions to begin with.
Closed questions (yes or no questions) are
inclined to inhibit sharing of information, and
can be leading in nature.
To really learn about someone and help in a
meaningful way , rather than leap to advice,
try to reframe any questions you have that
might be answered with a single word, by
rewording it to start with “what.”
For example:
Asking someone “Was it scary?”  not only
leads towards an answer the questioner has
pre-decided, but may also only prompt one
word in response.
“What was it like?”  followed by patient
LISTENING will likely deliver much more
detail.
Try it in conversation.

Food for the BRAIN
Your VO2 Max measurement is one of the
most powerful indicators of all cause
mortality .
This is an expression of the volume of
oxygen your body can use per minute, per
kilogram of body weight - basically your
aerobic fitness.
Since much of the oxygen is processed in
the muscles, we can see that this value
takes into account strength training and fat
loss, as well as what we consider traditional
“cardio.”
This can be accurately measured in a lab,
but your smartwatch might estimate this for
you, or you can self-evaluate using these
links: The Rockport W alking T est or The
Cooper T est.

New
Equipment!
I work hard and invest heavily into the gym
to make sure we always have an extensive
range of equipment. To add some movement
options, I have added a set of mini barbells,
plus a pile of new kettlebells to be sure there
is always plenty to go around, and the
workouts are varied and interesting.
