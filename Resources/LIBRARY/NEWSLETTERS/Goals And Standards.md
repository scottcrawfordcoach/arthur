GOALS and STANDARDS
Hi Scott,
Recently, I have noticed that my strength has dropped appreciably when I’m carrying out
certain exercises.
This is a function of training disruptions due to minor injuries, vacations and other random
occurrences that get in the way.
Over the past year, I have made a change in focus towards more endurance-based training
like running, cycling and hiking.
This has really boosted my aerobic fitness and until recently, hadn’t affected my strength
training.
However, I’ve begun to notice the drop in overall strength, and so I’ve had to take measures
to address that.
Muscle might be one of the hardest-won prizes we can work for. It takes a ton of work to
build, and a fair bit of effort to keep.
The body staunchly resists building and maintaining such metabolically costly tissues unless
they are absolutely necessary.
The only way we can convince the body that this is so, is to stress those muscles regularly.
As someone who is almost 50, this is a concern for me. Building muscle mass is like saving
for retirement - the longer you wait, the harder it gets.

As we get beyond 60, or especially 70 birthdays, the drop off in muscle mass can get quite
precipitous - we’re spending more and more, and have less and less capital to provide
returns.
Essentially what I’m doing right now is dipping into my savings before I’ve actually retired.
If this was really about money, I would be making some hard choices about my spending
habits.
In the gym, it means identifying which exercises are most beneficial, and doing them
diligently.
We need to have some sort of GOAL in mind in order to move forwards with purpose, but for
the moments when we don’t have the time or energy to forge ahead, it is worth thinking hard
about what our STANDARDS are for ourselves. What is the minimum retreat line we’re
prepared to fall back to so that the situation doesn’t become unrecoverable?
For me, I identified a few strength baselines that I NEVER want to fall behind and picked 3
exercises that I will commit to doing basically every day.
It’s taxing enough to be worthwhile, but really only takes a few minutes, so I have no excuses
- even if I forget all day and have to do it at bedtime!

Food for the BODY
Have you seen the Yuka app? It is an
incredibly handy app that uses your
phone as a barcode scanner in the
store to get detailed information about
the product’s nutritional information and
also any potentially harmful ingredients.
I believe it is a user-informed system,
so you may wish to research a little
deeper to fact-check anything it tells
you that might be important to you.

Food for the SOUL
This quote is commonly attributed to
Albert Einstein. Whether or not that’s
true, it is a powerful idea.
I am an advocate of establishing robust
scientific practice, but remember that
the scientific method is a process which
moves towards truth as new
information becomes available. The
facts of today might be the memes of
the future.
Your dreams are not invalidated
because someone offers facts to
disprove them.
Never give up at the first rejection.
The greatest scientific achievements
started out as dreams that no one
thought possible.

Food for THOUGHT
We love the comfort of monochrome.
Life is so simple when there are
absolutes. Right or wrong, good and
evil, rich and poor, Us versus Them.
                                         But there IS a
space between “I disagree” and “I’ll
prove you wrong”.                       There
is POWER in being comfortable saying
“I don’t know”.
It’s not just about sorting black from
white – the real trick is navigating the
myriad shades of grey in between.
Almost no-one’s mind was ever
changed by proving them wrong - we
need to resist the temptation to
fruitlessly argue a point and think: is my
goal to be right at any cost, or is it to
effect the outcome I set out to
accomplish.

Food for the BRAIN
You’ve probably heard of Omega-3 and
Omega-6 oils. You may even have heard
of the less common Omega-7s and
Omega-9s.
Do you know what that nomenclature
actually represents?
The fats in our body contain a range of
Fatty Acids in their structure.
Saturated fats have chains of Carbon
atoms joined like this C-C-C-C-C with
other stuff attached to the Carbons (mostly
Hydrogen).
In UNSATURATED fats, there are one or
more Carbon to Carbon double bonds.
C=C, which can be broken to allow
something else to bind there.
The OMEGA number represents how far
along the chain we go before we find the
first double bond in an unsaturated fatty
acid.
C-C-C-C-C-C=C-C-C

Free W ebinar!
I will be of fering a free webinar , particularly
suited to those who are interested in getting
started with introducing some exercise into
their lives.
The most important thing of all is that
the EXERCISE GETS DONE
regularly . The rest is academic until we
can establish the habit.
It is my goal to provide you with some
foundational principles which will allow
you to introduce small, ef fective
changes to your life; to let you become
a person who exercises regularly , and
armed with enough knowledge to build
on your early successes as your
strength and confidence grow over
time.
