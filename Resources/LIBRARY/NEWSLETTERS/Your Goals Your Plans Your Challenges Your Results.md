YOUR goals, YOUR plans, YOUR Challenges, YOUR
Results
Hi Scott,
We’re nearing the end of January. It may be that some of our New Year’s plans have become
somewhat derailed, or forgotten altogether.
It’s normal that the early enthusiasm of good intentions will wane as the novelty wears off and
the world throws obstacles our way, that make it difficult to stay on track.
The reality that meaningful change is a LONG term commitment can stifle motivation.
We need to focus on the behaviour and not the results.
Something that can make this extra difficult is comparing ourselves to others.
Perhaps we use someone else’s example as our aspiration - this can be very powerful, but
comes with risk.
Running is a fairly new thing for me in the last year. A couple of weeks ago, I went out for
what was, for me, quite a long run.

I was initially fairly pleased that I did it, then became deflated later when, after napping on the
couch, I noticed on Strava that Kilian Jornet had done a similar run early in the day,
significantly faster than me, and was now planning an indoor bike ride, wearing a down jacket
for heat acclimation.
For those that don’t know, Kilian Jornet is a professional Ultrarunner, Ski Mountaineer and
Climber, who is 10 years younger than me and 10kg lighter! He holds many records, including
a solo Everest summit in 19 hours, having done it in a disgraceful 26 hours earlier in the week
with a stomach upset. 😉
How shocking that I couldn’t keep up after my 6 month casual running career. 🙄
Instead of comparing data or achievements with those we find inspiring, use their example to
make choices from moment to moment.
If you’re on the fence about lacing up your shoes on a cold morning, think to yourself - “What
would Kilian do?” See a video of him here.
Just don’t look at his times!

Food for the BODY
Less is more?
Check out the ingredient list on these sour
creams.
Interestingly , the “Gold”, more expensive
product has fewer ingredients.
Notice, that the regular sour cream has a
number of emulsifiers and thickeners in
there, whereas the “Gold” is just milk,
bacterial cultures and enzyme.
There is some debate over whether
additives such as carrageenan cause gut
issues in humans, but which ingredient list
SOUNDS better to your intuition?
The “Gold” may be more expensive, but
given that the other is full of thickeners,
which is the better value?
As many of us probably consume more
calories than we need, I would generally
recommend leaning toward the higher
quality product, and mitigate the cost by
eating LESS.

Food for the SOUL
It may feel like you’re getting nowhere, but
most of the work we do is building our
foundation for future success.
Focus on everyday choices - not the
immediate outcome.
Think back to how you compare to six
months ago.
Keep it up!

Food for THOUGHT
This is why I prefer small group training, and
why building community is an important part
of my work.
I recommend Atomic Habits By James Clear

Food for the BRAIN
That’ s Intense!
How hard should you train?
Generally speaking, we want to drive our
muscles close to failure when we’re lifting, to
stimulate adaptation.
When we do cardio, it needs to be suf ficiently
taxing to deliver a training ef fect to get fitter .
However , don’t be so enslaved to a protocol or
advice that you heard that it leaves you
exhausted and daunted by the idea of showing
up next time.
I deliver an adaptive experience in the gym
which encourages participation over all-out
effort.
We will never make up completely for missed
sessions by going harder next time.
