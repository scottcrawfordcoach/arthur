New Behaviours, New Challenges
Hi Scott,
Fall and Winter are my favourite hiking seasons, and last weekend, I headed to the Lake Placid area to
make my way up a mountain.
It’s probably my favourite activity . I love the feeling of climbing to the top of the world, the challenge of the
cold and the terrain, and the perspective of comfort it brings. I’ve spent a lot of money on hotels at times
over the years, and it never beats the naps I’ve had on the floor of a chilly hut after 12 hours of
challenging the mind and body in the cold and sometimes dark!
It doesn’t really help our own lived experience to simply hear that others are worse of f, but electively
challenging ourselves and pushing our comfort zones DOES change our perspective on stressful and
uncomfortable situations - often in a powerful way .
As a trainer , I believe hiking with a backpack in hilly terrain is one of the best overall types of exercise. It’ s
relatively low-impact cardio, combined with upper and lower body strength.
Despite all this, it’ s STILL  difficult for me to add a new exercise load into my schedule. More exercise
needs more recovery , and there are only so many hours in the day to get in cardio, weights, and all the
other work I need to do. I do what I can and make peace with the rest.

If you are adding new activity into your life, go gently .

Food for the BODY
Chili Lime Almonds
Eating whole foods, rather than processed,
pre-packaged options, is better for nutrition
and satiety .
Snack time is particularly tricky here, as
tasty ready snacks are just so tempting.
Check out this Chili Lime Toasted Almond
recipe. It’ s super quick and easy , and these
are an excellent choice as a lunch
accompaniment or stand alone snack.

Food for the SOUL
Don’t feel bad if you don’t feel motivated to
exercise - there’ s nothing fundamentally
wrong with that. In some ways, elective
exercise is completely unnatural. In nature it
would simply be a waste of hard-won
calories!
Sometimes care for others, or a health scare
can give us the drive we need, but generally
it comes down to routine. Over time, a new
habit, if repeated often, becomes second
nature - we no longer have to think about it -
it’s simply what we do now . A part of our
identity .
Motivation rarely shows up with suf ficient
vigour or duration to help us get established
- good support and sound strategy is critical.
Be wary of any articles or advice which put
an exact timeline on adopting a new habit.
This is hugely variable between individuals
and scenarios.
Set small goals in favour of your desired
outcome that you feel very confident you can
achieve.

Food for THOUGHT
Our brains have a structure called the
Reticular Activating System. One of its
important functions is to filter the data
coming in from our senses and to present us
with the most important stuf f. It decides
what’ s most important by what we focus on
most. This means that the stories we tell
ourselves and the behaviours we exhibit, are
reinforced by our brain preferentially
showing us things that support our current
beliefs. Our words, our behaviours and our
intentions MA TTER.
We can use this system to our advantage:
Strive to avoid negative self-talk,
however casual
Try to bring focus to our successes,
however small
Don’t keep talking if we feel no one is
listening
Don’t threaten consequences if we’re
not prepared to follow through
Make promises to ourselves that we
know we can keep

Food for the BRAIN
Most people are familiar with the idea of
exercise making us generally fitter and
stronger . Here are just a few of the benefits
of exercise that you might not know about:
Our leg muscles are a vital part of our
circulatory system
Our muscles are a major contributor
to blood sugar regulation
Exercise releases a type of protein
from muscles called myokines.
Important endocrine functions
attributed to them include: low grade
inflammation mitigation, insulin
sensitivity , tumour growth
suppression, body weight regulation
and improved cognitive function
Hippocampal neurogenesis (new
brain bits!)
Growth of our neuromuscular
junctions (nerve-muscle connections)
