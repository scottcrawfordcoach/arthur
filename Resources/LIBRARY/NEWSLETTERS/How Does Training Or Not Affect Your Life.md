Hi Scott,
The Training Effect  is a physiological (or psychological) adaptation by the body in response to being
repeatedly asked to do something it can’t quite manage .
This means that to be ef fective, our workouts need to be challenging in the moment and progressive over
time. However “challenging” can look very dif ferent from person to person, and from day to day , and
“progress” doesn’t necessarily mean heavier or faster every time.
My job is to help my clients find just the right level of challenge, and to encourage them to push
themselves over time.
You may notice that I have both Personal Training and Coaching certifications. Many people, including
trainers, use these terms interchangeably . However to me (and to the International Coaching Federation)
these are VER Y distinct disciplines.
As a trainer , I’m concerned with the exercises themselves, and how they might be applied and developed
appropriately to the physical abilities of each client. As a coach , I follow the principle “Coach the Person,
NOT  the Problem.” This means that I take into account all aspects of a person when I’m helping them
determine what “challenge” means at any given moment for them. Are they nervous? Did they sleep well?

Do they feel self-conscious? Do they have a big emotional load outside the gym? Is it super hot and
humid? Maybe today isn't the day to push.
All of this to say , it is my job to set the level appropriately for you each and every day you show up. To my
valued clients - you may have noticed that I will subtly evolve my expectations to keep things challenging.
😉 And to those of you who have been thinking about getting back into exercise or a more healthy
routine, don’t worry at all about not being able to do the exercises in our workouts. Together , we’ll set the
appropriate level for you.
How’ s your training routine lately? Need help getting back on
track? W e provide low-key , discreet options.

Food for the BODY
Protein is arguably our most important
macronutrient. It is the source of Amino
Acids which our body uses to build our
tissues. It is also the most satiating.
I generally recommend people use whole
food sources for their nutrition, but as a
personal choice, I use a whey protein
powder each day . I do this to be sure I keep
my intake up without having to track my food
too closely .
I use this brand. French V anilla is my fave!

Food for the SOUL
No one achieves their best when they’re
stressed, and judged and criticised.
Success isn’t a linear process.  Long term
success will include many setbacks along
the way . Growth is about learning from them
and trying again.
Offer yourself the same compassion and
patience on your journey that you would
offer a good friend.

Food for THOUGHT
Resistance training isn’t just to build muscle
and look “good”…there are many practical
reasons to do it too.
If you need to pull your dog back from
a squirrel, you’re doing a row!
If you need to lift a baby seat out of
the car , you’re doing a bicep curl!
If you need to put a box on a high
shelf, you’re doing an overhead
press!
Remember:
Weightlifting is a sport for enthusiasts -
Lifting weights is for everyone
If you make sure the hardest work your body
does is in the gym, then you’ll be ready for
what life throws at you.8/12/25, 10:57 AM Gmail - How Does Training (or not) Affect Your Life?!

Food for the BRAIN
If you’re looking to safely build your fitness
base, some low intensity cardio is a great
start. Regular walking or gentle biking could
work to build the habit. W e can build on this
gradually by tracking our heart rate, making
sure we don’t let it get too high, and over
time, we should find we can do MORE for
the SAME level of exertion.  This means we
keep our exhaustion and chance of injury
low, and improve our chances of keeping the
exercise up.
One method for this is The Maffetone
Formula , developed by Phil Maf fetone. It is
a good place to start.
