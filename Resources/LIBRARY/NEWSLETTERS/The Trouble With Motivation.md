The Trouble With Motivation
Hi Scott,
If I had a dollar for every time someone told me, “I just need to get motivated,” I’d probably
still be working, but with less urgency. The idea that motivation is the missing link is so
common it feels like a truth. But here's the kicker: motivation is the reward, not the
prerequisite.
Most of us wait for motivation to strike before taking action, as though it’s a prerequisite to
getting started. But motivation often shows up after we act. It’s a lagging indicator; a
byproduct of consistency, progress, and a growing sense of identity. In coaching, we
sometimes help people flip this script.
If motivation is unreliable, then what do we rely on instead?
We rely on structure. On routine. On alignment with values. On supportive environments and
accountability. On making the work smaller and the wins bigger. That’s where coaching
shines: not by cheerleading you into action, but by helping you discover what matters enough
to you that you’d show up even on the days you don’t feel like it.
This edition is all about that. Motivation isn't a feeling to chase; it’s a capacity we grow, often
in the shadows of self-doubt, fatigue, and real life.
Let’s explore how to stop waiting for it and start generating it.

Motiva tion as a System, Not a
Spar k
Modern psychology teaches us that
motivation isn’t just one thing; it’ s an
interplay between several key factors:
Autonomy: Do I feel like I have a
choice?
Competence:  Do I have the skills to do
it?
Relatedness: Do I feel connected to
others as I try?
This is known as Self-Determination
Theory (Deci & Ryan), and it gives us a
practical framework. If you’re not feeling
motivated, maybe you don’t feel in
control. Maybe the goal feels too big.
Maybe you’re trying to do it alone.
Try this: instead of asking “How do I get
motivated?” ask “Where might I feel stuck
or disconnected?” It’ s often a better place
to start.

Food for the SOUL
“Motivation is a Lie - Discipline Isn’t
the Whole T ruth Either”
You’re not broken if you’re not motivated.
You’re human, and humans don’t always
want to do hard things, even the ones
they know  will help.
When we act in alignment with our
values, even in small ways, we prove
something important to ourselves. That
we’re the kind of person who can show
up. That we’re worthy of the outcomes
we’re seeking.
In the words of James Clear:
“You do not rise to the level of your goals.
You fall to the level of your systems.”
Sometimes, those systems are built one
nudge, one checkmark, one early walk or
pre-packed lunch at a time.

Do You Really Need Motivation, or
Just a Starting Point?
It’s easy to overestimate how much
motivation you need to begin and
underestimate how much action changes
everything. Starting often creates clarity .
Finishing builds identity .8/12/25, 10:51 AM Gmail - The Trouble With Motivation

In coaching, we might ask:
-What do you want to be different one
month from now?
-What would just starting  look like?
-How will you know if it’ s working?
Here's a challenge: Pick something small
you’ve been putting of f, and do it today .
Don’t wait for motivation. Let today’ s
action be tomorrow’ s proof that you’re
moving.

The Motivation Trap in Nutrition
Nutrition decisions are often framed as
a willpower issue, but what if it's a
systems issue?
Motivation to eat well doesn’t spring
from guilt or pressure. It comes from
preparation, clarity, and repeated
success. If you’re constantly reacting to
hunger or cravings, you're not building
the kind of structure that motivation
can stand on.
Here’s a practice: pick one meal a day
to get right for a week. Just one. Build it
around a lean protein source, some
ﬁbre, and something you enjoy. When8/12/25, 10:51 AM Gmail - The Trouble With Motivation

it becomes easy, that’s your cue;
motivation is warming up in the wings.

Local Ayurveda Opportunity
Ayurveda is an ancient medical science that originated in the Indian sub-continent.
Today, Ayurveda is growing in popularity as a natural method of maintaining and
improving one’s health and well-being, using the tools of nutrition, lifestyle, and
yoga (movement, stillness, breath, mindfulness, and meditation). Mona Warner, a
Doctor of Ayurvedic Medicine, has been seeing clients in person and online for
over a decade.

Mona is looking for 10 volunteer clients for the 2025 Ayurvedic Health Counsellor
training. Each volunteer will get a 2-Hour Initial Consultation (valued at $250 CAD)
and leave the session with a list of Ayurvedic Recommendations for their health
and well-being. These sessions will be held either online or in-person, and are
practice cases for the students of the training, so these will be in front of a group of
Ayurvedic Health Counsellor trainees. If you are interested in learning more about
Ayurveda or Ayurvedic Consultations, check Mona’s website
