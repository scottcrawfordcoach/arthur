Winter Is Coming!
Hi Scott,
Having a well-established routine reduces decision fatigue. This can be particularly helpful at times of
stress, or in the winter when the cold and dark can make keeping our promises to ourselves seem harder
than ever but we want to keep our healthy habits going.
We can bolster ourselves against falling of f the wagon by using what’ s known in behaviour change circles
as “friction.”
Add friction between you and undesirable habits - an example might be not keeping certain snacks in the
house.
Reduce friction between you and desired behaviours - for example, putting your cof fee machine on timer ,
laying out your gym clothes in exactly the right place (some even sleep in them!) and even making sure
your car cleaning brush and ice scraper are kept in the house by the front door , so you don’t need to
break into a snow-covered car to start clearing it of f.
I know that I find it much harder to get out of bed into a cold room when the alarm goes of f if I haven’t
planned what I’m going to wear , or I forgot to set the cof fee machine.

Food for the BODY
One of my favourite foods is my homemade
yoghurt. It’ s high in protein and healthy fats,
but feels like having a rich dessert.
Heat whole milk to 185F/85C, then cool the
pan in a shallow sink of cold water until it’ s
110F/43C.
Mix in a cup of good quality , organic greek
yoghurt of your choice (or the end of your
last batch). Be sure it only has milk and
bacterial cultures in it.
Keep it warm (I use an instant pot) for 7
hours or so. Strain overnight through a
cheesecloth, then mix as much of the whey
back in as you need to reach your desired
consistency .
What’ s your favourite healthy treat that feels
more decadent than it should?

Food for the SOUL
I see this picture often online, but it’ s one of
my favourites. It really speaks for itself, and
it embodies the approach I foster towards
personal growth.
While others debate whether this or that is
best, or dream about their next big thing,
we’re over here working away , doing the
best we can.
Get clear about what your goal is and take
small steps every day in service of that
outcome.
When it comes to fitness, we have to
become a PERSON who exercises
regularly FIRST . The rest is details.
You’re doing great!

Food for THOUGHT
Susan David PhD is a well-known
researcher in the field of emotions.
This post of hers is a quote taken from her
excellent, famous TED Talk - The Gift And
Power Of Emotional Courage
We don’t need to wholly “embrace the suck”
or kill ourselves in the gym on the basis of
“no pain, no gain” but nevertheless, progress
in anything usually incurs a cost to us. It
might cost us time, energy , money , ego, or a
strongly-held belief.
We have to be honest with ourselves about
what we want, and what we’re prepared to
give up to get it.

Food for the BRAIN
So you want to do a push up?
They’re really hard! They involve bench
pressing around 65% of your body weight,
except you also have to be the bench!
Knee pushups are a fine exercise, but
they’re not the best for progressing to a full
push-up.
Engage your Glutes, Abs and Lats to make a
strong plank, put your hands around
shoulder width apart, with your elbows about
canteloupe distance from your ribs!
If a push up from here is too hard, start on a
wall and do 10 morning and night. Then
once 10 is easy , move to the kitchen
counter . Next, try the stairs, with your hands
on the 3rd or 4th step. Over time, as 10 gets
easy(ish), move down a step.
Remember , this could take months!
Good luck!
