Hi Scott,
Welcome to the first edition of the Synergize Coaching newsletter ! As my valued clients, previous
clients and those that are interested in fitness and health, I wanted to start of fering you all a little
something special in your inboxes each month.
What you can expect from me in these newsletters:
Useful wellness tips or ideas for the mind, body and soul
Actionable insights for health, fitness and FUN around this beautiful city of ours
Opportunities to join us for regular , drop in or even some new FREE workouts
Consistent and positive motivation to show up for yourself, however that works for you
On a personal note, my own training has really taken a backseat to so many competing priorities lately ,
from a busy sailing season to time spent on administrative tasks to more time on household projects.
This is why establishing a routine is important.  Once regular training is the norm, it’ s totally fine to
take breaks, and it’ s easier to bounce back from interruptions. You can see why I really stress the idea
of showing up and doing what you can  - slow to a crawl if you must, but keep moving forward. When
you fall of f the wagon, just acknowledge it and jump back on. Resist the urge to let it turn into something
bigger!

What’ s your snacking kryptonite?
For me, it’ s potato chips . If they’re in the
house, I will eat them. Often. And lots of
them.
However , I like to approach healthy choices
from a position of abundance, not restriction
– How can I fill my life with new , healthy
choices? It means I’m not focused on what I
can’t have. Enter , my new fave healthy
snack — Three Farmers Fava Beans .
Found by accident at HomeSense recently
(but you can also get them on Amazon  or
direct ). Why are they so good?
Tons of delicious flavours, I am loving
Zesty Cheddar right now .
They are crunchy , tasty , satisfying
and full of nutrition!
Their ratio of fibre and protein to
carbs is great!
Enjoy!8/12/25, 10:57 AM Gmail - Showing Up For You This Month 💪

The journey of personal growth is not
linear . It’s normal for our goals to evolve as
we grow .
Make small choices every day in favour of
the person you’d like to become, and see
what happens.
Need help figuring out what that looks like
for you?

Food for THOUGHT
What becomes possible when we start
with the assumption that everyone is
doing the best they can?
Anyone might carry burdens and fears and
struggles that others will never know about.
Turning our focus to what is, rather than
what we hoped for in others, can ease
frustration, improve connection and open up
possibilities.  Give it a try .8/12/25, 10:57 AM Gmail - Showing Up For You This Month 💪

Check Them Out HereFood for the BRAIN
Did you know our muscles aren’t just
“pistons” providing locomotion, but a vital
endocrine organ, which help regulate our
metabolic processes.
Studies have shown that calf raises while
seated can have a significant impact on
blood glucose regulation.
You can try this if you spend a long time
sitting - or even better - take intermittent
short walks , which can provide the same
benefit for your calves and the rest of your
body too.
