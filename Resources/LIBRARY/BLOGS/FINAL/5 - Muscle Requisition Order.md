Requisition Form: Muscle Edition
Imagine your body runs like a massive industrial complex. Each day, a huge number of internal departments are filing work orders, requisition forms, and maintenance requests. Your immune system needs resources for patrol duty. Your brain needs fuel and raw materials to support thinking, memory, and mood. Your bones need to be maintained. Hormones are dispatched and repairs are made.
Somewhere in that vast system, the muscular department is raising its hand saying, "Excuse me... we've got a new order…”

That order? It's from you. Every time you strain your muscles, you’re filing a formal request to build more. But the body, ever the cautious CFO, doesn’t just hand over the budget.

Skeletal muscle is expensive - biologically expensive. It costs a lot to build, and even more to maintain. From an evolutionary perspective, muscle isn’t just for looking good in a t-shirt. It’s a survival tool. If your daily behaviour doesn’t suggest it’s needed, the body won’t waste energy on keeping it around.
You request muscle through two main channels: mechanical tension (lifting weights or using muscles until they’re tired) and nutrition (specifically, dietary protein). Think of it as submitting a form with two required signatures. The mechanical tension tells the body where the muscle is needed. The protein intake provides the raw materials to build it. Without both, the body files your request in the recycling bin.

Let’s say you’ve done a proper strength session. Maybe you hit some squats, rows, and presses. You've challenged the muscle fibres, especially the fast-twitch ones. The local environment gets noisy with signalling molecules shouting: "Rebuild! Reinforce!" That’s when protein becomes critical. You eat, ideally including a decent serving of high-quality, leucine-rich protein (like eggs, dairy, meat, soy, or a complete protein blend). That provides the amino acids necessary to repair and grow muscle tissue. The more complete and timely the protein supply, the better the response .
Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) ramps up quickly after training and stays elevated for up to 48 hours. That doesn’t mean your muscles are brand new in two days. The actual tissue turnover is gradual. Dr. Andy Galpin and others estimate that complete skeletal muscle turnover (where most of the tissue is rebuilt) takes somewhere around 3–6 months. Like replacing bricks in a wall one by one, it’s a slow, cumulative process. Individual variation matters too: caloric intake, hormones, sleep, training age, and recovery all affect how fast that work gets done.

For most people, visible changes happen in months, not weeks. That’s important, because the world of social media fitness can distort our timelines. If you’ve only been lifting for a few weeks and aren’t seeing big changes yet, remember: the work order is in. Your body is assembling the parts. Stay patient.

Observation: we rarely see acute protein deficiency in Western healthcare settings. But we do see chronic under-consumption, especially in older adults, and it’s a problem. Sarcopenia (the loss of muscle mass and function with age) isn’t an inevitable consequence of getting older. It’s partly the result of failing to renew that work order. Beyond appearance, it affects independence, balance, fall risk, hospital stays, and quality of life.

As we age, the signal to build muscle becomes less sensitive. It’s like shouting through a closed door. The door used to be open when you were 25, but now that you’re 65, you have to knock louder and deliver more building materials. That means higher protein intake, more resistance training, and a greater commitment to both. Fortunately, muscle remains trainable well into your 70s, 80s, and beyond.

If your protein intake is low, especially during a calorie deficit or period of stress, your body may have to make some hard decisions. It’ll prioritize critical functions like enzyme repair, neurotransmitter production, and immune support. That means it may rob your muscles to get the amino acids it needs elsewhere. This concept, sometimes described as metabolic triage, helps explain why chronic under-eating of protein can lead to subtle, long-term decline.

You don’t get the upgrade. You just get the patch job. Over time, this contributes to net muscle loss, even in people who are otherwise eating “enough calories.”

You can have the world’s best resistance program on paper, but if you don’t show up and lift, your body won’t believe the request is real. Likewise, you can buy fancy protein powders and supplements, but if your daily intake doesn’t meet your needs (roughly 1.6–2.2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight for active individuals), your blueprint sits idle. Consistency beats intensity here, and what matters is showing up over and over again, not chasing personal records every day.

The body listens to what you do, not what you intend. The form is only accepted if the paperwork is filed repeatedly, consistently, and with the right signatures.

If you want more muscle, whether for strength, function, metabolic health, or aesthetics, you need to:

1. Submit your request with quality resistance training.
2. Provide the raw materials through complete protein sources.
3. Repeat this consistently for months (and years).
4. Adjust your inputs as you age, because the system gets stingier, but not closed.

Your body is pragmatic. It doesn’t reward wishful thinking, but it’s also generous. If you show it what you need, and feed it accordingly, it will build what you’ve asked for.

So go ahead. File that requisition form. Just be ready to follow through on the job.
