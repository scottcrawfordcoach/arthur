The Need Beneath the Want

In both training and coaching, people come to me with goals. They want to get stronger. Leaner. Fitter. Faster. They want more energy, better sleep, less pain. They want to feel confident on the beach, or finish a 10k, or keep up with the kids. Sometimes they want to look great in a dress; sometimes they just want to stay out of hospital.
But whatever the surface goal may be, there's almost always a deeper need beneath it.
Someone might tell me they want to deadlift 300 pounds. But it’s not really about the barbell. It’s about pride. About self-trust. About proving something to themselves, or to someone else. And once we identify that deeper need, we unlock options. Because maybe that person gets injured. Maybe life throws them a curveball. If their only win was the 300-pound lift, they’re left empty-handed. But if what they really wanted was to feel capable, confident, or proud; we can find other ways to get them there.
This is where coaching differs from training. In training, I might help you lift the weight. In coaching, I help you figure out why you wanted to lift it in the first place. What it really meant to you. What need it was meeting.
When physicality becomes part of someone’s identity; whether that’s through sport, aesthetics, movement, or self-sufficiency – it’s powerful. But it can also become fragile. If our sense of self-worth is tightly tied to performance, what happens when we can’t perform? What happens when illness, injury, age, or circumstance force a change?
It doesn’t just affect athletes. I’ve known people in their 70s and 80s who take enormous pride in being able to shovel snow or mow the lawn. Losing that capacity feels like losing a part of themselves. It’s not vanity; it’s identity.
This is why coaching matters. It gives us a chance to dig below the surface want, and uncover the foundational need. Once we name that need, we can start building resilience. Because needs can be met in more than one way.
Unless performance is an absolute priority, such as in competition, there is benefit to working towards becoming process-focused, rather than outcome-focused.
In fact, something I often notice is that once people start training regularly, they develop a deeper appreciation for the body they have, not just the one they aspire to. They stop waiting for “perfect” and start building a relationship with their strength, their movement, their ability. They gain agency. That shift is powerful and protective. It softens the blow when life doesn’t go to plan.

This is why coaching can be so powerful, because it helps us unearth the deeper truths we might not say out loud. It invites us to ask bigger questions:

What do you (think you) want?
This is the starting point; the goal you’ve named.

What do you really want; what do you need?
This is the deeper value: autonomy, 	dignity, joy, connection.

What are you prepared to give up to get it?
Real progress often involves trade-offs. Naming them helps us move forward with clarity.

There’s no right answer, but when you can answer honestly, you begin to train with intention. You know what matters and why. You know what to protect when things get hard.

Give yourself the grace to pivot. If a run becomes a walk, or a barbell becomes a dumbbell, or a gym becomes a garden, that’s not failure; that’s adaptability. That’s strength in another form.

So if you’re on a journey of personal change, don’t just focus on the outcomes. Ask yourself what those outcomes are in service of. What do they say about who you are and what you value? What do you really want? And how else might you honour that?

Goals 	are important, but needs are foundational. When you understand the need beneath the want, you become far more resilient, far more adaptable, and far more likely to keep showing up for yourself in whatever way the season of life allows.
