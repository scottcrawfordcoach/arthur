Don't Wait for the Proof
Sometimes when I meet a new client, it’s not because they’ve set an exciting new goal. It’s because they’ve just received difficult news: a diagnosis, a warning, or a scare. A brush with illness or injury has suddenly made the abstract feel real, and they’re ready to act.
But here’s the thing: many of the warning signs were already present.
Their body may have been sending them hints for quite some time. They didn’t need bloodwork to tell them something wasn’t right, but it often takes an official label to make us believe it.
It’s a natural human tendency. We assume we’re fine, until we’re not. We wait for proof. A test result, a scan, a doctor’s note. Until then, we treat our health as a constant that we’ll start taking care of once there’s a real need, or we have spare time.
Many of the chronic diseases we fear most, like type 2 diabetes, heart disease metabolic syndrome are decades in the making. These conditions don’t just appear one day. They develop quietly over time, and by the time they show up clearly in routine blood work, we may already be on the steep part of the slope.
That doesn’t mean it’s too late, but it does mean it’s harder. More complicated. More urgent.
Trajectory matters more than snapshots
In most healthcare systems, routine blood work and physical exams offer a snapshot in time. They’re designed to identify clear markers of disease, and don’t always track the subtle downward slide before symptoms become acute.
That’s understandable. Healthcare provision has to prioritize urgent needs - we can't expect every system to monitor wellness proactively at scale.
That means we have to be stewards of our own long-term health, because even if your test results come back “normal,” your trajectory may not be.
If you’re sedentary, carrying significant excess weight (especially around the waist), frequently eating ultra-processed foods, drinking heavily, smoking, or chronically stressed and underslept, the direction is clear. These aren’t guarantees of disease, but they are signposts on the road. You don’t need a lab result to tell you that the route needs to be adjusted..
Don't confuse absence of evidence with evidence of absence
There’s a powerful concept in logic and medicine alike: the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence. Just because no one has told you you’re pre-diabetic doesn’t mean your glucose regulation is optimal. Just because your blood pressure wasn’t flagged doesn’t mean your heart is healthy.
So many people have said some version of this:
“I thought I was doing okay,  then the doctor told me I wasn’t.”
Often, though, their bodies had been telling them all along. They just didn’t know how to listen. Or they didn’t trust what they heard until it came from a white coat and a clipboard.
What can you do before the proof arrives?
If you’ve never been told you’re at risk, but you don’t feel your best - don’t wait. If movement feels hard, if your energy is always low, if your body aches more than it should, if your meals come mostly from boxes or takeout windows; that’s information. That’s feedback worth acting on.
You don’t need to overhaul everything overnight. You don’t need to live in fear of what might happen, but you can begin. You can try to improve your sleep. Move your body more often. Choose one meal a day that nourishes you. Drink more water. Get fresh air. Seek support.
These aren’t just clichés; they’re levers. Small shifts that change your trajectory, slowly at first, then meaningfully over time.
The power of early action
One of the great truths of investing in your health is that the earlier you start, the less dramatic your actions need to be, and the better your results. It’s like saving for retirement. If you begin in your 20s, modest monthly deposits can lead to incredible security. If you start at 60, it takes a lot more, and the margin for error is slim.
Your health is the same. Investing in strength, movement, metabolic flexibility, and stress management now pays off later, in ways you may not even recognize until they matter most.
You don’t need permission to take care of yourself
We’ve been conditioned to treat health as something reactive. We wait until something breaks, then go and get it fixed.
Your body is more than a machine. It’s a dynamic, adaptive system that responds to your habits, for better or worse, every day.
The good news? You don’t need a referral to start walking. You don’t need a prescription to drink more water or cook a few meals at home. You don’t need a diagnosis to decide that your body deserves care, movement, rest, and attention.
If you’re already living with health challenges, this still applies. There’s always something within your control; always a next step worth taking. Not to punish yourself, not out of guilt, but because your life is worth living as fully as you can make it.
So don’t wait for the proof.
Don’t wait until the bloodwork is bad, until the weight gain becomes debilitating, until your knees hurt so much you can’t walk the dog.
Don’t wait for the chest pain, the diagnosis, the shock.
Life is unpredictable; there are no guarantees, but the sooner you act, the more likely you are to change the ending. Not with perfection, but with intention.
Your future health starts today; not with fear, but with awareness. Not with overwhelm, but with one small choice at a time.
