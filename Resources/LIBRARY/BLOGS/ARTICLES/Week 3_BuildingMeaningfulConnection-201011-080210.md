Building Meaningful Human Connection  Inspired By Sean Stephens & written by Cheyenne Diaz, Feb 14, 2019
Many believe that only a lucky few are born with the ability to connect with anyone — but that’s actually not the case. All of us have the ability to develop a profound human connection with the people we meet. More likely than not, you already have several precious relationships in your life. That’s because we’re all innately social creatures, hard-wired to seek out a community. In fact, our drive for human connection is so powerful that multiple studies have shown that feeling lonely and isolated is more detrimental to our health than smoking or obesity. The longest-running study in the world, the Harvard Study of Adult Development, has shown over the span of 80 years that a strong sense of community is the most signiﬁcant factor in living a longer, happier life. And Dr. Matthew Lieberman of UCLA showed that social pain is interpreted by the brain the same as physical pain. Our bodies react in the same way.

So why is a strong sense of human connection, something so natural and vital, so difﬁcult for us to create? Why do so many of us feel so lonely? For starters, some of us are confused about what connection actually means. True connection isn’t what happens when your Bluetooth earbuds recognize your computer. That is communication, says world-renowned speaker Sean Stephenson in this episode of the Mindvalley Podcast with Vishen Lakhiani. He says, Connection is not an exchange of  information. Connection is an exchange of  humanity. It’s an exchange of  emotion. And Sean, more than anyone, knows what it takes to connect with people. By his teens, he had already broken 300 bones in his body due to a rare genetic disease called Brittle Bone disease. He made a promise early on to take up “the responsibility to connect with humanity” by trying to “meet people and get to know their lives.” That attitude of his has put him on the same stage as the Dalai Lama, President Bill Clinton, and Sir Richard Branson. It’s also saved another person’s life. Sean tells this transformational story in the podcast, but through it, he learned, Time to you is not time to everybody else. What might just be a passing moment to you could save somebody else’s life. It’s no surprise that human connection can have such a huge effect. After all, think about someone who had a massive impact on your life — did you like them because they were articulate? Because they had the best resume? Because they smelled nice? No, most likely it was because you felt they cared about you. As Sean points out, That’s when connection takes place: the moment we feel that somebody cares about us, we’re open to them. The other reason we’re not able to connect with others is that, frankly, a lot of us carry some serious baggage that interferes with us caring about those we meet. We carry our shyness, our cynicism, our competitiveness, and our pride with us. But it doesn’t have to be this way. As Sean spent time with some of the most charismatic and inﬂuential leaders in the world, he discovered:
13 key strategies you can use to connect with just about everyone. 1. Know names and use them Here’s a quick insight: Everybody wants to be known. So when you meet someone, ask for their name, repeat it back, remember it, and then use it in conversation. Remembering and using someone’s name is one of the smallest acts that speaks the loudest. Neuroscientists have even named a phenomenon after the power of hearing our names spoken. The “Cocktail Party” Effect, revealed in a 2006 study, shows that we can hear our name even in a room full of crowded people and loud voices. Another study shows that the brain recognizes our names as part of our core identity. This means that when you’re remembering someone’s name, you’re not remembering a word; you’re remembering them. 2. Be With the person you’re with Have you ever felt someone’s attention on another person as you were speaking to them? Feels pretty awful, right? It’s important to be with the person you’re with. When you’re talking with someone and your eyes are not on them but the person you consider “the most important person in the room,” you’re sending out the energy that you don’t care or value the person right in front of you. The truth is that the most important person in the room is the one right in front of you. Give whoever you are talking to 100% of your focus. When you make people feel seen, you end up having more engaging conversations and more opportunities to deeply connect. 3. Ask others for their opinions We’ve all got advise to give and wisdom to share, but it’s rare that someone gives us time to think and share our thoughts. Don’t worry, you don’t have to agree with what others say, but asking questions from a place of sincere curiousity shows that you think what they’ve got to say is valuable. You’re
letting them know you care what they have to say. And doesn’t everybody want to be heard? And when you open the space for what others have to say, they feel hear, like they matter and they will do their best thinking! 4. Physical touch shows you’re a warm person While this strategy requires sensitivity and discretion, physical touch can be extremely effective for establishing a connection. Nonverbal cues matter. In fact, Dr. Albert Mehrabian conducted several studies and found that only 7% of the information we take in about another person is through words. About 38% is through vocal elements like tone, and 55% is through nonverbal elements such as body language. Light physical contact at just the right moment actually increases tips for restaurant servers, persuades subjects to share personal information, inspires individuals to help look for lost objects, and encourages people to sign petitions. The customers at a restaurant might not even have noticed that their server touched them on the shoulder, but their body would have immediately reacted by increasing dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin (the “happy brain” chemicals) and decreasing cortisol levels (the stress hormones). A simple touch can convey the fact that you’re a warm person and increase their connection with you. 5. Smile with your entire body Again, body language is important! And that includes facial expressions. The Dalai Lama has a smile that is said to “melt an angry soldier’s heart.” By his mere presence, he can bring the people in the room closer together. How does he do this? By smiling with his entire body. Because it’s not just about the lips; it’s about the eyes, too. And because we all have mirror neurons (the same neurons that cause you to yawn when you see another person yawn), other people will be much more likely to smile back at you. That has the effect of inspiring a sense of human connection in almost everyone who sees you. 6. Be playfully wise We’d probably assume that the Dalai Lama is wise — but did you know that he’s playful as well?
It’s this combination that really seems to have an effect on people. It’s astonishing when you realize that the Dalai Lama was exiled from his own land and is constantly under threat, but yet he still manages to be both wise and joyful at the same time. Wisdom is being in touch with your intuition. Hear the unspoken word. Sense the body language of another person. Dance in the moment.  7. Hit pause and listen How often do you listen, like really, really listen? How often do you pause and take the time to think about what the other person is trying to say instead of trying to think of something to say? Sean suggests that listening doesn’t just happen when we stop speaking, Listening takes place when you put your life on pause. People tend to treat conversation as if it’s a competitive sport, trying to one-up the other person, “win” the debate, or display what they know. But conversations aren’t one-man performances. And when we compete, we can’t connect. By putting our thoughts on hold for the other person, we create more space for them to open up with us. It can be hard to break the habit of talking more than we listen, but you can take a page from Marie Forleo’s book and use the I.A.P ., or the Intentional Awkward Pause. This is how the I.A.P . works: Instead of reacting to what the other person says right after they tell you something, pause for 3 seconds. More often than not, the other person will have more to say. This means you can a) get to know them better and b) know for certain that you didn’t unintentionally cut them off. 8. Smooth voices are appealing It might sound silly to say “check your voice,” but your voice actually does affect other people’s perceptions of you quite a bit. Studies show that vocal traits, such as pitch, texture, and modulation, inﬂuence who people consider likable, dominant, and competent. In a study conducted by Dr. Cara Tigue and her colleagues, subjects were asked to vote for higher or lower-pitched versions of previous American Presidents. The lower-pitched versions were chosen 69% of the time. That’s quite the difference.
A voice that’s lower and smoother is more likely to convince us that the owner is calm and competent enough to be a leader. Nobody wants a voice that sounds frantic and ﬂustered. But knowing someone who can control their own energy is attractive. And, as Sean says, the person who’s able to control their energy the best is the most powerful person in the room. 9. Ask creative questions We all know that ﬁrst impressions matter (science conﬁrms this) so how do we make a good one? Here’s a tip: Get out of the weeds of weather and small talk. Get to know them by asking questions. And don’t just ask the “nice, safe” questions. “What do you do?” doesn’t cut it. You’ve probably answered that question a million and one times and so have they. Richard Branson makes a point to ask the people he meets creative questions. He assumes that everybody around him has something interesting to say and prompts them to share with questions like: •“What’s the best thing that’s happened to you today?” •Or, “What’s the one thing you’ve always wanted to do because it could change your life, but you were too scared to start?” •Or you could use one of Vishen’s favorite questions: “What gets you out of bed in the morning?” More creative questions engage the other person, help you learn more about them, and ultimately lead to better conversations and connections. 10. Stay humble There’s a distinct difference between conﬁdence and humility. The two are often mistaken for each other but here’s how you can tell the difference: A conﬁdent person will try to improve the relationship; an arrogant person will try to prove themselves. Value your connection to the other person more than being right or important. Now, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ever celebrate yourself. Of course you should! A great way to do that is just to give people notice or ask for permission to share some information, advise, or observations.
11. Think of human connection as an intense game of ping pong As we said earlier, “conversation” doesn’t mean “monologue” or “one-man performance.” Both sides have to participate equally in answering questions, asking questions, and listening. In order to connect, you have to share and ask for others to share. It’s easy to either dominate or disappear from the conversation. The more difﬁcult thing is to stay engaged. Stay mindful of whether you both have been able to talk about 50% of the time. Use some of the other tips above, like hit pause and listen or ask creative questions, to generate dialogue with the person you’re talking to. 12. Be generous with appreciation We’re serious here. Appreciation should ﬂow out of you. After all, there’s no tax or cost for appreciating another individual. It’s no good to keep ourselves from honouring others, either, because we think it will go to their heads or that somehow it detracts from your own greatness. Celebrating someone else isn’t just a booster for them; it’s also a booster for you. So appreciate, and appreciate a lot.  After all, it’s one of the most effective, delightful things we can do. 13. Create a space for vulnerability The one thing people who connect to others all have in common is that they cared about how others feel in their presence. People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. –Maya Angelou How will you make others feel as a coach?
