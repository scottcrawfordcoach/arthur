The Secret to Getting Better at Running? Go Slower.
The Secret to Getting Better at Running? Go Slower.

If you’re looking to improve your endurance, your energy, and your resilience—without burning out or getting hurt—there’s one counterintuitive principle to embrace:

Slow is the way forward.

For many beginners (and even some experienced athletes), the temptation is to go hard, chase speed, or try to match what others are doing. But when it comes to sustainable running, especially early on, your pace should feel easy.

That’s how we build the aerobic base—the foundation of almost all human movement, and a key to lasting health.

Enter the Maffetone Method

Dr. Phil Maffetone’s training philosophy is simple: spend time training at or below your maximum aerobic heart rate, calculated as:

180 – your age = your MAF heart rate

This method trains your body to use fat as fuel, stay in low-stress energy zones, and avoid overtaxing your system too early.

If You Don’t Have a Heart Rate Monitor

No problem—use perceived exertion:
- You should be able to speak in full sentences
- Your breathing should feel steady and manageable
- If you’re gasping or need to stop to recover, you’re going too hard

What Progress Really Looks Like

At first, staying in the aerobic zone might mean walking. Over time, the same heart rate will allow you to go farther, or slightly faster, with less effort. That’s real improvement—measurable, meaningful, and safe.

Progressing Without Running

Once you’ve built some walking consistency and your body’s adapting, you might progress by:
- Extending the time you walk
- Adding gentle hills to your routes
- Wearing a light backpack or weighted vest
- Walking faster while staying under your aerobic threshold

In time, you may naturally begin to jog in parts of your walk. That’s great—but it should feel like a nudge, not a leap.

Stay Patient

We’re not building a moment—we’re building a system. And systems take time. Your bones, tendons, and fascia need a lot longer to adapt than your lungs or motivation. Be kind to your body. Go slow. Let it lead.
