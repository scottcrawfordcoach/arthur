Start with the Habit — Not the Hype

There’s a familiar rhythm to change.

We start with good intentions. We commit to the new plan. We feel motivated, maybe even excited. But then life happens: a bad night’s sleep, a busy week, a wave of self-doubt. And before we know it, the momentum fades and we’re left wondering:

“Why can’t I just stay motivated?”

It’s a question I hear all the time. And here’s my honest answer:

Because motivation isn’t built for the long haul. Habits are.

If you’ve ever felt like motivation is a fickle, unreliable partner — you’re not wrong. But the good news is, motivation isn’t required to make real change. What’s required is something quieter, more dependable, and ultimately more powerful: habit formation.
