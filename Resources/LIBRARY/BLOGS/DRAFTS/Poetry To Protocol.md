Poetry to Protocol

Poetry to Protocol

Science is often seen as a cold pursuit—data, charts, randomized control trials. But at its heart, science begins not in the lab, but in the mind. In curiosity. In metaphor. In story.

Some of the most powerful shifts in human understanding started not with measurements, but with wonder. With someone asking, “What if?” The idea of germs? Once heretical. The concept of neuroplasticity? Dismissed for decades. The gut-brain axis? Once woo; now PubMed.

And so we find ourselves, again and again, straddling a line between the poetic and the proven.

This tension is not a flaw in the system. It is the system.

The poetry is what makes us ask better questions. The protocol is how we test them. And if we’re too quick to dismiss the poetry—or too proud of our current protocols—we risk missing the next leap.

Take functional medicine. Or fasting. Or the surge in breathwork and cold exposure. Each of these started on the fringes, rooted in ancient practice, personal experiment, or even spiritual ritual. Slowly, research caught up. Sometimes it confirmed what tradition had long observed. Sometimes it corrected course.

And sometimes, it found something entirely new.

This doesn’t mean every fringe idea deserves airtime. Not all anecdotes become evidence. But neither should we demand data before we allow for curiosity. Especially in fields as complex and personal as health, behaviour, and transformation.

We should be skeptical. But not cynical.

Today’s facts are often tomorrow’s footnotes. “Scientifically proven” is a phrase we would do well to retire—not because we shouldn’t trust science, but because we should respect it. Science is not a vault of truths; it is a process for getting closer to them.

That’s why over-skepticism can be just as naive as blind faith.

In my work, I often see this dance firsthand. A client might describe a sense that “something just feels off,” or that they’ve had great results from an unconventional habit. Sometimes there’s no study (yet) to validate it. Sometimes there’s a growing body of evidence that hasn’t made it to mainstream consensus. Do I dismiss it? No. I note it. I stay curious.

Because many things that “work” don’t work for the reasons we assume.

An idea can be effective even if it isn’t technically “right.” It might work by analogy, by placebo, by attention. Or it might simply work because it invites someone to believe in change. That doesn’t make it useless. That makes it interesting. Worthy of exploration.

And when those poetic beginnings are treated seriously—tested, studied, refined—we get progress. Meditation becomes cognitive therapy. Ancient grains become metabolic medicine. Cold water becomes performance science.

Poetry to protocol.

This is not a call to abandon evidence, but to remember that evidence often begins in imagination.

To be rigorous, yes. But also reverent. Because science without imagination stagnates. And imagination without testing misleads. We need both.

So whether you’re a coach, a clinician, or someone trying to improve your own life—don’t be afraid to dwell in the grey areas. Don’t be so eager for proof that you miss the next question. And don’t be so proud of facts that you forget how often they change.

Because sometimes, a metaphor becomes a model. A story becomes a study. And a poetic hunch, when given the right attention, becomes tomorrow’s gold standard.

This is the arc of human understanding.

This is poetry to protocol.
