Turning Back Time? Not Quite. But Training Changes Everything.
A recent post by Stuart Mackinnon (@mackinprof) really struck a chord with me. It pointed to a study that, at first glance, almost sounds too good to be true: older adults (~69 years old) who engage in regular resistance training perform *as well as or better than* young adults (~24 years old) who don’t lift — on key measures of physical function like chair stands, the 6-minute walk test, and timed up-and-go.

📚 Kendall H, Kipp LE, Mettler JA. Transl J ACSM. 2025;10(3):e000312. PMID: 38881904 | DOI: https://doi.org/10.1249/TJX.0000000000000312

There were no gimmicks. No fancy supplements. No pre-workout powders, hacks, or secret biohacks. Just consistency and resistance training — twice per week, following the ACSM’s established guidelines.

This wasn’t some fringe finding either. It reinforces something I see again and again in my own work — that muscle loss, strength decline, and loss of independence in older age are *not inevitable.* But they are probable — *unless* we do something about it.

### The Real-World Power of Strength

One of the reasons I find this study so compelling is that it measures **functional outcomes** — not just lab-based strength tests or isolated metrics. Chair stands, timed walking, and get-up-and-go tasks are *exactly* the kinds of movements that translate to real life. They represent your ability to get off the couch, walk to the bus stop, climb stairs, or recover your balance after a misstep.

This is the kind of strength I care about most in the work I do with clients. It’s not about lifting the heaviest weight or sculpting perfect physiques (though those can be valid goals). It’s about **preserving autonomy**, **enhancing quality of life**, and **building resilience** for whatever life throws at us.

That’s why this kind of research isn’t just interesting to me — it’s *validating*. It affirms what I’ve seen with my own clients: older adults *can* regain strength, improve capacity, and in many cases, outperform much younger people who don’t train.

### The Consistency Myth

We often overcomplicate things. Scroll social media for long enough and you’ll be convinced you need red light therapy, a protein shake timed to the minute, creatine cycling, or some elaborate morning routine to make progress.

But this study — and the broader body of research around resistance training in older adults — tells us otherwise. The participants in the Kendall et al. study didn’t take anything special. They just trained. Twice per week. Consistently.

That’s it.

This lines up with what the ACSM, the WHO, and researchers like Dr. Stuart Phillips (another great Canadian voice in this space) have long advocated: **basic, progressive resistance training done consistently over time is one of the most effective interventions we have for aging well.**

### Aging Isn’t the Enemy — Inactivity Is

Let’s be clear: aging does come with physiological changes. We lose muscle mass, our hormonal profile shifts, and recovery takes longer. But many of the declines we associate with aging — weakness, poor balance, slow walking speed, reduced independence — are **less a result of age itself and more a result of disuse.**

That’s a crucial distinction. Because while we can’t stop time, we *can* influence how our body adapts to it.

As Dr. Daniel Lieberman (author of *Exercised*) points out, modern sedentary lifestyles are profoundly mismatched with the physically active environments our bodies evolved in. In ancestral contexts, older adults remained active and valuable members of the group because they *moved.* They lifted. They walked. They adapted.

In my own work, I see this play out all the time. Clients in their 60s and 70s often arrive believing they’re “too old to get strong.” But within months — sometimes weeks — they’re lifting heavier, moving more freely, and expressing shock at what their bodies can still do.

They haven’t discovered magic. They’ve discovered **adaptation**.

### What This Means for My Work

I work with people at all stages — newcomers, returners, athletes, retirees. And in each case, my approach is the same: meet people where they are, create a space where showing up is a win, and help them move toward strength and confidence in a way that fits real life.

This study gives me even more confidence in that approach.

It confirms that:
- You don’t need a perfect training history to benefit.
- You don’t need to train every day.
- You don’t need to be young.

You just need to start. And stay with it.

It also reminds me to keep focusing on what really matters: function, consistency, and resilience. These are the things that give people their lives back. Not just their muscle mass, but their freedom to say yes to hikes, carry groceries, play with grandchildren, or simply rise from a chair with ease and dignity.

### What Can You Do With This?

If you’re reading this and thinking, *I probably should be lifting* — you’re not wrong. But the good news is, it’s not too late. Ever.

You don’t need a gym membership. You don’t need fancy equipment. You need resistance, intention, and structure — and maybe a coach or trainer who can help guide the process.

Start small. Twice a week is enough. Focus on the basics:
- Squats, pushes, pulls, carries.
- Progress slowly.
- Prioritize good movement and consistency over intensity.

If you’re already training, let this be your nudge to keep going. You’re building a foundation that pays dividends in decades, not just days.

### Final Thought

As Mackinnon wrote:
“No gimmicks. No biohacks. No fancy pixie dust... Just consistency and resistance training.”

Simple. Effective. Proven.

It’s not about turning back time. It’s about *owning the time you have* — strong, capable, and on your terms.
