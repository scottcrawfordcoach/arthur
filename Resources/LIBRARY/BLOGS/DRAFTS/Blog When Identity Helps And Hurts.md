When Identity Helps — and Hurts
In the world of training, coaching, and even everyday habit-building, we often hear about the power of identity. “Don’t just go for a run — become a runner.” “Don’t just eat better — be the kind of person who fuels their body well.” And for good reason. When our actions align with how we see ourselves, those actions become easier to repeat. Identity can serve as a powerful anchor for change.

But recently, I came across an article that offered a cautionary lens on this very idea. It examined why vegans, on average, report higher rates of depression and anxiety. While the popular theories around nutrient deficiencies or social pressure might have some truth, the author, Justin Brown, proposed a deeper reason: overidentification.

In his analysis, many individuals didn’t just adopt veganism as a dietary practice — they adopted it as an identity. A central, defining part of who they are. And when that identity becomes so strong, so all-encompassing, it can backfire.

This isn’t just about veganism. I see the same pattern across fitness, wellness, and personal development. We take on a new role — “the athlete,” “the high performer,” “the one who’s always strong” — and over time, that label starts to shape how we think we *have* to behave. Even when it no longer serves us.

### The Double-Edged Sword of Identity

As a coach and trainer, I *do* encourage identity-based habit building. It works. Seeing yourself as someone who trains regularly, or as a person who values their health, makes those behaviors easier to maintain. You don’t have to negotiate with yourself every time — you just act in accordance with who you are.

This is supported by behavioral science. James Clear in *Atomic Habits* talks about this directly: habits that align with our identity stick longer. And it mirrors insights from Wendy Wood’s research on automaticity — the smoother and more consistent a behavior feels, the more likely it is to persist.

But here's the paradox: what happens when the identity becomes too rigid? When we cling so tightly to the label that we lose flexibility, freedom, or joy?

The runner who’s sidelined by injury and no longer feels “like themselves.”
The person who lost weight and feels pressured to maintain it perfectly.
The helper who’s so used to caring for others, they feel guilty for resting.

When identity becomes performative, it can lead to stress, disconnection, or even shame.

### Focus on the Process, Not the Outcome

That’s why one of the most important shifts we can make — in fitness, in coaching, in life — is to focus on the *process*, not the outcome. Rather than chasing a result, we commit to showing up. We train because training feels good. We fuel our bodies well because it gives us energy. We reflect, journal, or practice mindfulness not to “achieve enlightenment,” but because the practice itself is valuable.

Psychologists call this *autotelic behavior* — when the activity is its own reward.

This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have goals, or that identity has no place. It means we treat our identity as something flexible, not fixed. Something that supports us, not confines us.

### Belonging Without Overidentification

Another layer here is the human need to belong. Many people adopt strong identities not just for personal meaning, but to feel part of something larger — a team, a movement, a community. And that’s a beautiful thing. It can foster connection, accountability, and even healing.

But when that belonging depends on behaving a certain way, it becomes fragile. It’s no longer support — it’s surveillance. And we end up managing appearances rather than attending to our actual needs.

A powerful practice here is to periodically ask:
- **Is this identity still serving me?**
- **Do I feel free to grow and change, or boxed in by expectations?**
- **Am I still connected to the *why* behind what I do — or just the label it gives me?**

If your answer to any of these feels tight, conflicted, or unsure — that’s a signal worth paying attention to.

### A Gentle Challenge

So this month, I invite you to pause and consider:
**What identity are you holding onto that might be holding you back?**
And just as importantly:
**What process can you fall in love with again?**

Let your behaviors flow from values, not just labels. And give yourself permission to be more than one thing.
