Protein: More Than Just a Number
Ask someone how much protein they should eat, and chances are they’ll quote the RDA: 0.8 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. That’s about 56g per day for the average man, 46g for the average woman.

But here’s the thing: that number was never designed to promote optimal health. It’s the minimum to avoid deficiency — not the target for thriving. And if we’re serious about maintaining strength, energy, metabolic health, and quality of life — especially as we age — then we need to think differently.
The Protein RDA: A Starting Line, Not a Finish Line
The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is based on studies designed to prevent muscle wasting in sedentary individuals. That’s a pretty low bar.

Recent research — including work from experts like Professor Stuart Phillips at McMaster University — suggests that 1.2 to 2.0 grams per kilogram is a more realistic range for active individuals, older adults, and anyone looking to build or preserve lean mass. That’s double (or more) the traditional RDA.

More isn’t always better — but more than the minimum? For most of us, yes.
Protein Isn’t Easily Stored — So Your Body Needs a Steady Supply
Unlike carbs and fat, protein isn’t easily stored. The body doesn’t have a dedicated reservoir for amino acids. Instead, it uses what it needs to support muscle repair, enzyme production, immune function, and more — and excess is either used for energy or excreted.

Because of this, it’s often recommended to distribute protein intake across meals. Doing so may offer small benefits for muscle protein synthesis and can make it easier to hit daily targets — particularly for those aiming to preserve or build lean mass.

But let’s be clear: the most important factor is your total daily intake. Hitting your target over 24 hours matters far more than perfect timing. Once that’s in place, you can experiment with spacing and sequencing to suit your goals and schedule.
Resistance Training: The Primary Trigger for Muscle Growth
It’s important to be clear: protein alone doesn’t build muscle. The primary stimulus for muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is resistance training.

Strength training sends the signal: “This tissue is needed.”
Protein provides the raw materials to support that growth and repair.

Think of training as the blueprint, and protein as the bricks and mortar. Without the workout stimulus, even a high-protein diet won’t meaningfully increase lean mass. But when paired with progressive resistance training, adequate protein intake amplifies the body’s ability to adapt.

And within that protein intake, leucine — an essential amino acid — acts like the ignition key, triggering the process of MPS after training.
Muscle: More Than Strength
We tend to think of muscle as just strength or aesthetics. But muscle is an active endocrine organ. It communicates with other tissues, supports immune function, and plays a critical role in regulating blood sugar.

When you eat carbs, your muscles help buffer blood glucose by pulling sugar from the bloodstream and storing it as glycogen. If your muscle mass is low — or inactive — this system works less effectively, contributing to insulin resistance and energy crashes.

In this way, maintaining muscle isn’t just about performance. It’s metabolic protection.
Protein as a Tool for Fat Loss
If you’re trying to lose body fat, increasing protein intake can make that process more effective — and more sustainable. Why?

1. Protein is the most satiating macronutrient. It helps control hunger and reduce cravings.
2. Protein has a higher thermic effect. It takes more energy to digest, absorb, and process than carbs or fat.
3. Protein helps preserve lean mass during weight loss. This means more of the weight you lose is fat, not muscle.

But here’s the caveat: simply adding more protein on top of a high-calorie diet doesn’t help. The key is to build meals around protein, then add colourful vegetables, whole-food carbs, and a reasonable portion of healthy fats.
Muscle: Your Reserve for Hard Times
Muscle isn’t just for the gym. It’s also your protein reservoir when times get tough.

If you get sick, injured, or become immobile for any reason, your body taps into muscle for the amino acids it needs to heal and maintain function. The more muscle you have, the better you’re equipped to recover and rebound.

In this way, muscle is a form of insurance — a metabolic savings account you can draw on when life throws you off course.
So, How Much Protein Do You Need?
Here’s a practical way to frame it:

- General health & maintenance: 1.2–1.6g per kg of bodyweight
- Fat loss with lean mass preservation: 1.6–2.2g per kg
- Older adults or rehab clients: closer to 2g per kg may be ideal
- Minimum per meal: aim for 25–30g with at least 2.5g leucine

Spread your intake across 3–4 meals, include a variety of sources, and don’t fear repetition. But remember: consistency of total daily intake is what matters most.
Final Thoughts: Build Around Protein
Protein doesn’t work in isolation — but it does belong at the centre of a healthy meal. Build your plate starting with a complete protein source, then add fibre-rich vegetables, whole-food carbs, and healthy fats to round things out.

This approach supports appetite regulation, muscle health, metabolic stability, and recovery.

And perhaps most importantly: it reflects the long view. Because we’re not just eating for the next workout. We’re eating to support a body that moves well, adapts well, and stays strong — for life.
