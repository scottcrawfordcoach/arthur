So You Want to Be a Runner? Start Here.
So You Want to Be a Runner? Start Here.

If you’re thinking about becoming a runner, or wondering whether you qualify as one, let me start with this:

If you want to be a runner, you already are one.

There’s no initiation ritual. No minimum pace. No required physique. You don’t need to run five kilometres or own special shoes. You just need the intention to begin—and the willingness to take the next step.

For what it’s worth, I didn’t start running routinely until just over a year ago.

Despite being generally fit and active, I hadn’t built running into my weekly routine. But I found myself looking for a simple way to add some higher-intensity work to my life—and running made sense. Since then, I’ve grown to appreciate its efficiency and its emotional rewards. I’ve also learned to respect it.

More than any other form of exercise I do, running—especially road running—brings me closest to injury. That’s why I approach it with care, and encourage others to do the same.

Running Doesn’t Have to Mean… Running (Yet)

Here’s the key mindset shift: starting to “run” doesn’t mean breaking into a jog tomorrow.

For many people—especially those who are sedentary, overweight, or recovering from injury—the best place to start is walking, guided by effort level, not pace.

Your body doesn’t benefit more just because you run. It benefits when you move consistently, within a sustainable intensity, and give it time to adapt.

Use Perceived Effort or Heart Rate to Guide You

Your best tool for progress isn’t your speed. It’s your self-awareness.

- Use a heart rate monitor (if you have one) to stay in your aerobic zone—roughly 180 minus your age.
- Or use perceived effort: aim for a pace where you can hold a full conversation. If you’re breathing hard or struggling to talk, back off.

This is where the benefits begin. You're improving your aerobic capacity, building energy systems, and allowing your joints and tissues to keep up with your cardiovascular system.

Settle Into a Walking Habit First

Start with something like:
- 15–30 minutes of purposeful walking, 3–5 days a week
- At a pace guided by your breath and effort—not ambition
- On varied terrain if possible, but flat is fine too

Once you’ve done this consistently for a few weeks—without pain, fatigue, or burnout—you’ve already begun building your base.

Let Running Come to You

Running may become part of your practice later. But for now, your task is simply this:

Move your body in a way it can handle. Let consistency lead.

Because showing up gently but regularly will get you far more results than a dramatic sprint followed by weeks of recovery.
