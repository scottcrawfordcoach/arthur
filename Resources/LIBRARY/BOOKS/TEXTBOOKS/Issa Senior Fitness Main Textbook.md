PREFACE vii
America, as well as the rest of the world, is graying. Adults over the
age of fifty represent a large and important segment of the popula-tion, which is often under-served by the fitness community. Ifsomething is not done soon to keep this group fit for life, manyolder adults are going to “rust out” before their time. As this groupmoves through middle age and into old age, if they are not proper-ly maintained and kept well, the medical costs to keep this groupalive will be enormous. Many of the causes for poor health in olderadults are the result of poor health decisions. This, coupled with theeffects of a sedentary lifestyle, makes the later years more challeng-ing. Many fifty-plus adults already have some chronic health issuesthat necessitate a lifestyle change in addition to corrective exercise.Fortunately for older adults, good choices and regular physicalactivity can remediate many of these health issues.
The medical system of today is not well equipped to handle long-
term, chronic conditions. The medical system is good at “fixing”sick bodies but is not very good at preventing illness. While ourhealth care system does an excellent job of handling acute condi-tions, it often fails to keep “fixed” patients motivated to follow awellness program to prevent further problems after they have beendischarged. The fitness educator of the future can play a pivotal rolein the health care system. The future looks good for fitness profes-sionals who know how to keep chronic health conditions fromadvancing. Also, the fitness educator who can work in partnershipwith the medical community to provide successful rehabilitationwill be highly sought after. An expert in the field of gerontologysaid, “Most things that get worse with age can be positively influ-enced with regular and prudent exercise.” With proper wellnessintervention, older adults can be healthier and fitter tomorrow thanthey were yesterday. Isn’t that the fountain of youth?
Unfortunately, what many of today’s fitness professionals lack is the
ability to address the unique needs and varied functional abilities of
older adults. Fitness professionals of the future should be able to
individualize instruction based on the health status of the client.While staying within their professional scope of practice, theyshould be able to provide a safe and effective fitness program forenhancing quality of life that is appropriate to the client’s goals.Most personal trainers in the gym are not trained to treat thisimportant segment of the population. The fitness educator of thefuture who can work together with older adult clients and theirtherapists to keep older individuals operating at an optimal capac-ity will be highly valued.
Many times when older adults wish to improve their fitness and
wellness, they go to a gym and sign up with a trainer who pushesthem to work too hard and too fast only to get hurt and drop out.Other older adults feel they can do it all themselves and try to pickup where they left off when they were younger. They end up usingoutdated methods and once again fail, get hurt and quit. What isurgently needed is a group of knowledgeable and compassionateinstructors who can assess the client’s age, health status, goals, andviiiSenior Fitness

lifestyle then incorporate all of these elements into a realistic fit-
ness program. An older adult cannot and should not be trained inthe same manner as a young person. This is where this bookcomes in. It is designed to give the reader the most practical andrealistic information available to train older adults to improvetheir functional fitness in order to increase their quality of life foras long as possible.
This book addresses the skills and techniques necessary for today’s
fitness educator to completely serve active older adults. Its focus isto provide the reader with the skill set necessary to be a respectedmember of the wellness community. The creed of the medical com-munity is to “do no harm,” which is also the motto of this book.Everything containedwithin this book is basedon sound science. Thebook does not go intodetail to explain this sci-ence, but there are manyexcellent texts thataddress this very well.Also the book is notdesigned to inform thereader how to work withthe frail elderly. Rather,its goal is to explain howto empower the olderadult to avoid becomingfrail and losing the abili-ty to function fully with-in the mainstream of life, to help the older individual continue tocarry groceries, walk the dog, climb stairs, reach for items on highshelves, and so forth. This book is appropriate for all fitness educa-tors. Group exercise teachers, personal trainers, health/wellnesseducators, fitness facility managers, therapists, and activity direc-tors will all benefit from the information presented.

# It Is Never Too Late To
MAKE A CLIENT FEEL GREAT!This text will take the theory behind older adult fitness and show
the reader how to apply it by providing a set of “best practices” forworking with all levels of older adults. All too often what soundsgood in a research environment fails when taken into the “trench-es.” In particular, this manual will help fitness professionals whowork with older adults do the following:
• Become knowledgeable about the needs of
older adults
• Understand the common chronic conditions
associated with aging
• Assess needs, evaluate progress, and modify
instruction appropriately
• Apply fitness principles in a practical manner
for older adults
• Prescribe appropriate exercises or modifications
to best fit older adults’ needs

After completing this unit you will be able to:
• Describe current trends regarding aging
• Understand the importance for the fitness profes-
sional of being able to work effectively with an
aging population
• Explain the difference between chronological age
and physiological age
T oday, people are living healthier into old age with fewer disabili-
ties, and this trend is expected to continue. For older adults oftoday, life has never been so good. Life expectancy at birth hasincreased by 4.7 years for men and 3.5 years for women over the lasttwenty years of the twentieth century. Most older adults are living alifestyle that wasn’t imaginable twenty or thirty years ago. T oday’solder adults are less disabled, and the rate of disability is on thedecline as well.
Of course, more can be done to postpone chronic health problems.
This is where the fitness education of older adults can play a pivotalrole. If the fitness educator of older adults could teach simple
lifestyle modifications such as increased exercise, weight control,
smoking cessation, and healthy eating habits, the risk of lifestyle ill-nesses like cancer, cerebrovascular accidents, heart disease, andosteoporosis could be reduced, thus saving society millions of dol-lars. In concert with health professionals, we as fitness educatorshave the means to reduce and postpone these chronic and oftenexpensive and disabling diseases. And the interventions we provideare relatively inexpensive, providing the client a good return oninvestment. This is not to say people will not still die, but thoseclients who engage in healthy behaviors can compress the timebetween the onset of disability and death.
Welcome to the profession of Senior Fitness. Older adults will
come to you for various reasons and with varied backgrounds.Some of your clients will be very able and fit, while others willbe frail and in need of therapeutic exercise. However, all will beentering “senescence,” a time of growing out of adulthood andinto old age. Senescence, much like adolescence, prepares theperson for the next stage of life, which in this case is “elder-2Senior Fitness

Being Sedentary Can Be Hazardous
to Your Health
The following list includes information and facts regarding
physical inactivity.
• Inactivity and poor diet cause at least 300,000
deaths a year in the United States.
• Adults who are less active are at greater risk of
dying of heart disease and developing diabetes,
colon cancer, and high blood pressure.
• More than sixty percent of U.S. adults do not
engage in the recommended amount of activity.
• Approximately forty percent of U.S. adults are
not active at all.
• Physical inactivity is more common among older
adults than it is among younger adults.
• Inactivity increases with age. By age 75, about
one in three men and one in two women engagein no physical activity.
• Regular physical activity has a strong correlation
to social support from family and friends.
• People with disabilities are less likely to engage in
regular moderate physical activity, than peoplewith no physical disabilities; yet they have similarneeds to promote health and prevent lifestyle-related disease.
hood.” Elderhood offers a time for reflection that is most fully
appreciated after a life complete with happiness, sadness,health, and illness.
Some experts define the aging population in two segments—the
young/old and the old/old. An important concept to know as atrainer of older adults is that not all older adults are the same.Generally, the arena of the young/old is the Kingdom of the Welland Healthy. These individuals are mobile and for the most parthealthy, even though some might have some health issues. Theold/old inhabit the Kingdom of the Frail and Sick. The old/old haveentered a time of loss—loss of health, loss of a spouse, loss offriends, loss of independence, loss of function, and many times lossof memory. The “one size fits all” theory will not work with thispopulation. Whether young/old or old/old, however, your clientscan benefit from your compassion and knowledge.
We now know that exercise increases your odds of living longer. The
data clearly shows that people who are active and do have a heartattack have much better survival rates than unfit heart attack vic-tims. A classic study involved a group of Harvard alumni. It fol-lowed 16,000 men, aged thirty-five to seventy-four, for twelve tofifteen years and found that, all else being equal, the more thesemen participated in moderate to vigorous activity, the longer theylived. Those who were active could expect to add one to two yearsto their lives by the time they reached eighty years of age.
Y et another study, this one in the March 14, 2004, New England
Journal of Medicine, reached similar conclusions. This study foundthat men with the greatest capacity for exercise live the longest. Thefindings suggest that exercise capacity is a better predictor oflongevity than any other health marker. Dr. Walter Bortz, a StanfordUniversity professor, agrees with this and takes it a little further,suggesting that leg strength is the best predictor of whether a per-son can live independently.
We all know that physical and mental changes occur as we age.4Senior Fitness
Aging affects all systems of the body; however, the amount of the
effect varies by individual. Dr. Bortz believes that everything he wastaught in medical school about aging was wrong. T oday, medicaldoctors, along with physiologists and gerontologists, are redefiningthe aging process. We know that normal aging, healthy aging, andsickness as seen in older people, are not the same. It wasn’t too longago that we expected heart disease to occur in older men andwomen; now we are aware that heart disease is the result of anunhealthy lifestyle and is not a factor of aging.
If someone were to ask you to describe the typical, eighty-year-old
person, what would you think of? Hopefully, you would describe thisperson as vibrant and active. Unfortunately, many people woulddescribe an eighty-year-old person as frail, possibly using a walker,and most likely, sedentary. However, aging does not have to be syn-onymous with disability and infirmity. For decades we’ve seen shriv-eled and non-energetic individuals among the older segment of the

population and have come to think
of this as the norm in our society.Studies like those previously men-tioned suggest otherwise, however,as do recent studies of older athletesin which researchers are findingthat these individuals don’t slowdown like their sedentary counter-parts. Their muscle mass doesn’tdecrease as much, and when suchdeterioration does occur, it’s not theresult of old age but, again, of dis-
use. According to a study conducted by Stanford University, long-time runners live longer and have less pain, disability, and diseasethan their sedentary peers. The runners in the study were leaner, hadfewer joint problems, and needed less medication than non-runners.
What we’re learning is that our clients need to be proactive partici-
pants in the aging process rather than passive observers. Many ofthe negative changes observed in aging were detected in the bed reststudies of the 1970’s. The changes noticed in the bed rest studies aresimilar to the changes seen in people who have a sedentary lifestyle.Some experts on aging believe that total bed rest for twenty-onedays is equivalent physically to thirty years of aging. Other scientistssuggest that one hour of exercise increases life by one hour. Fewpeople die strictly from old age. Rather, they die from the repercus-sions of diseases such as cancer and heart disease, so often found inolder, unhealthy people.
The expectation of a slow, steady decline with progressing years
does not hold true for those individuals who show interest in fitnessand a healthy lifestyle. We know that a very fit person of seventy,someone on a regular exercise program, can be compared to a mod-erately fit person of thirty who exercises only occasionally. Asremarkable as that may seem, more and more evidence supports thefact that chronological age has very little to do with aging and is6Senior Fitness

nothing to worry about. The stigma of slow decline associated with
aging need no longer be an issue for those committed to fitness andhealth. Ask yourself how old “old” would be if you didn’t know howold “old” was. Research suggests that there is a significant differencebetween chronological age and physiological age.
Unfortunately, many older adults believe it is too late to start exer-
cising and that their past abilities and present disabilities are pre-dictors of how fit or healthy they can become. This is false! Nomatter how well one maintains oneself, the physiological processwill eventually take its toll. However, people need to take to heartthe idea that proper exercise is an important ingredient in maxi-mizing physiological capacity. Regular daily activity has been a wayof life for virtually every person who has reached the age of onehundred in sound condition. Exercise training does not stop thebiological clock, but at the present time, it is the safest means avail-able of slowing it. Alex Lief, M.D., a Harvard Medical School pro-fessor of gerontology, has said that exercise is the closest thing we

# Unit 1 7

have to an “anti-aging pill.” If a person wishes to age successfully,
they must commit to engaging in a program of systematic exercise.
Science supports the idea that exercise can slow down the aging
process, and researchers continue to be persuaded that fitness forolder adults is a must:
• Dr. Herbert DeVries is convinced that men and
women in their seventies and eighties can achieve
levels of vigor usually associated with people thirtyyears younger.
• Dr. Steven Blair, of the Institute for Aerobic
Research in Dallas, found that as much as one andone-half of all functional decline typically associat-ed with aging is the result of disease and can bereversed with proper exercise.
• Dr. Walter Bortz, author and professor, said, “Our
aging is in our own hands. It is no one else’sresponsibility. If we depend on our doctors, ourfamilies, our government, we risk compromisingthe quality of our lives.” If we take charge of ourlives we can ensure that our future years are cre-ative and radiantly alive.
• Dr. Spirduso believes that older adults who stay
engaged physically, socially, and mentally age bet-ter than those who do not.
• Dr. Fries, of Stanford University, believes that older
people can age well with grace and wisdom, witand experience, energy and vitality.
The bottom line is that it is never too late to feel great!8Senior Fitness

“We are under-exercised as a nation. We look instead of play. We
ride instead of walk. Our existence deprives us of the minimum of
physical activity essential for a healthy living. ”
—John F. Kennedy
If we want our clients to age well, not only do we need to have
them be physically active, but we also need to educate them aboutthe most current information about wellness. Dr. C. Everett Koop,
former Surgeon General of the United States, said it well: “no pre-
scription is more valuable than knowledge.” The purpose of thiscourse is to connect the knowledge known about healthy aging tothe practitioner in the field. We here at ISSA believe that, regard-less of age or disability, clients can be better tomorrow than theyare today if they take the first step to fitness by engaging in thehealthy practices described within this course.
# Age-Related Changes
Aging is inevitable and extremely desirable when compared to suchalternatives as death or being feeble and frail. As we have alreadydiscussed, Americans are growing older and living longer. In 1880,only 3 percent of the U.S. population was over sixty-five years old.In 1980, 11 percent of the population was sixty-five and older. Bythe year 2050, 20 percent of the population will be over sixty-fiveyears of age. Based on recent findings, a growing number ofresearchers believe that with healthy lifestyles we may be able to setback the biological clock or at least slow it by as much as forty years.Many experts believe that humans have the potential to liveuntil
one hundred ten or one hundred twenty years of age.
“Walking is man’s best medicine. ” —Hippocrates
Because the aging process is very individual, the speed and extent ofaging varies from person to person. Many of the characteristics weassociate with aging, such as osteoporosis, poor posture, and theshuffling gait associated with weak muscles, are effects of “normal”aging. Fortunately, the effects of healthy aging are very different.Many of the negative effects of aging are brought on in part by phys-ical inactivity and can be reversed with regular physical activity. Wemust dismiss the stereotype that senior citizens are frail, elderly peo-ple who are incapable of health and vitality. We must replace thesenegative images of sick old people with positive images of healthy,active older adults. We must challenge ourselves to replace the label12Senior Fitness
“senior citizen” with other, more positive terms such as “chronolog-
ically advanced.” Sadly, many clients allow their age to exclude themfrom becoming the healthiest and most fit people they can be, butage is not a barrier to wellness or fitness. While there is currently nomagic formula to be invented to reverse the aging process, currentresearch suggests that proper exercise may in fact extend one’s lifespan and that, without question, it will improve the quality of one’slife. Exercise can make your client walk taller, feel better, and livelonger. Physical fitness is important for everyone!
T echnically, we begin to age from the moment of conception. As the
body approaches the middle years, if it is not well cared for, theeffects of “normal aging” begin to become quite obvious. Variousorgans and systems begin to display deterioration. Some of theeffects of this show up as heart disease, arthritis, elevated bloodpressure, and low back problems. Additionally, hormone produc-tion decreases from both the ovaries and the glands, immune func-tion declines, and elasticity diminishes in muscles, skin, andarteries. Older adults must begin to accept the fact that the phrase“use it or lose it” has real meaning if they are to maintain physicaland emotional independence. Many older adults fear losing theirindependence more than dying. Proper exercise can help older

# Unit 2 13

adults prolong independence, as well as slow down the progression
of many common chronic conditions. It has been shown that lackof regular exercise is one of the factors that significantly increasesthe probability of hospitalization in people over age sixty-five.
While aging is inevitable, being
feeble and frail is not. Very often,unsuccessful aging is the result ofabuse, disuse, and misuse of ourbodies. This is much like the oldgrandfather clock in the livingroom that does not work. It does-n’t work because the springs haveeither lost their ability to recoil orbecause they are over-worn. Ormaybe somebody forgot to windit up. Which analogy best repre-sents your client’s body?
We are all aware that aging results in changes in each body system.
These changes may contribute to a variety of health problems expe-rienced by the older individual. However, many of the major dis-abilities associated with aging, such as loss of cardiovascular fitness,decrease of muscle mass, reduced bone mass, glucose intolerance,diminished immune function, and intellectual function loss, can bereversed or prevented by becoming involved in a regular and pru-dent comprehensive exercise program. While this may sound like afairly sweeping statement, more and more scientific studies supportthis conclusion.
EXERCISE, THE ANTI-AGING SOLUTION
While aging is a normal, human phenomenon, unfortunately, it issurrounded by myths that many people accept as fact. The conceptof old age carries with it biases that are deeply ingrained in our soci-14Senior Fitness

ety. Many people believe that health and vitality are synonymous
with youth and that sickness and frailty are associated with aging.Cultural myths may make our clients fearful and hopeless. If theybelieve these myths, it may diminish their motivation and thus theirzest for life!
There are places in the world, such as the Russian province of
Georgia and the state of Florida in the United States, where menand women live to one hundred years and beyond, while experi-encing health, vitality, and vigorous activity. It is projected that bythe year 2050 there will be approximately one million Americansover the age of one hundred. The fastest growing segment of thepopulation is the eighty-five plus group.
The following are some commonly held beliefs that are associated
with aging. How many of the following assertions do you thinkpeople believe?
1. Older people are frail and sickly.
2. Aging is synonymous with senility.3. Older people are less productive than younger people.4. Older people are resistant to change.5. Aging is a uniform process with similar outcomes for
all people.
Thankfully, these things are all false! Y et it is a sad fact of life that
most people in America “rust out” before they “wear out.” Y our job
as a trainer of older adults is to be an agent of change. Active peo-ple age at a rate of only 1/2 percent a year, as opposed to inactivepeople who age at a rate of 2 percent a year. While that does notsound like much, in reality, it takes an active person four years toage the same amount as an inactive person does in one year!Activity really is the anti-aging solution.

# Ageism
If you or your client believe the myths described earlier to be true,
then it will be difficult to motivate change. Many trainers are tryingto sell youth when in reality they should be selling wellness andfunctional fitness. We must dismiss the stereotype that senior citi-zens are frail, elderly people who are incapable of health and vitali-ty and replace our negative images of sick old people with positiveimages of healthy, active older adults. At the same time, we shouldnot try to make our clients feel as if they are “bad” if they don’t look,act, or feel like thirty-year-olds. We should encourage our clients tofeel comfortable in their skin and not allow others, especially adver-tisers, to pressure them into feeling badly about their appearance.
Because aging is an individual thing and no one ages in exactly the
same way, the search for universal characteristics of aging may haveto be abandoned. T o prove this to yourself, think about going to ahigh school reunion. Some folks look much older than others with-in the same class. Biologists may have to be satisfied with justdescribing the characteristics of aging, some of which will be expe-rienced by most individuals at some point in their lives and some ofwhich may never be experienced by some people.16Senior Fitness

Aging is influenced by our environment, genetics, and lifestyle, and
its speed and extent vary from person to person.
According to gerontologist John Rowe, M.D., “The impact of
chronological aging has been overemphasized and a substantialportion of the physical changes we consider natural to aging areactually due to lack of exercise, poor diet, and bad habits such assmoking and excessive drinking.” Based on the findings to which wehave already referred, a growing number of researchers believe thatwith healthy lifestyles we may be able to set back the biologicalclock or at least slow it by as much as forty years.
# Causes Of Premature Aging
Our age and health are influenced by how we live but, more impor-tantly, by how we have lived. The leading authorities on aging main-tain that what makes us age prematurely is misuse, disuse, andabuse of our bodies and not just the passage of time. More andmore research suggests that people can beat the aging game by stay-ing active or becoming active and by adopting healthy habits. In1984, Dr. Bortz did groundbreaking research when he compiled areview paper titled “Disuse and Aging” for the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association . He found that if you listed all the
changes in the human body that are ascribed to aging (changes inmuscles, bones, brain, cholesterol, blood pressure, sleep habits, sex-ual performance, and psychological inventory) and then comparedthe list to changes that occur in the human body due to physicalinactivity, there would be a striking similarity between the two lists.The near duplication of these lists shows that many of the bodilychanges we have always ascribed to the normal aging process are infact caused by disuse of the body.
Aging is an inevitable part of life for all species. Differences in human
rates of aging are based on many factors. We all know individuals intheir sixties who are invalids and others who are in their eighties whoare healthy, active, and alert. Among the factors which will influence

Researchers at Duke University project that if everyone born today

The more unhealthy habits your client has and the longerthey have had them, the more at risk they are of not living to a ripeold age. Fortunately, if you work with them to change some of theseunhealthy habits, their body, family, and doctors will appreciate it.
Take the Assessment of Healthy Habits Survey found in Table 2-1.the aging process are genetics, disease, dietary habits, and perhaps
most importantly, physical activity/physical fitness level.
Genetics accounts for 30 percent of aging potential, leaving 70 per-
cent in our own hands. While fitness levels decline for both the fit andthe unfit person with age, the rate of decline is somewhat slower inthe fit individual. After age sixty-five many inactive individuals lackthe basic fitness level to perform the activities necessary for daily liv-ing. In comparison, the active person can remain self-sufficient formany years to come. Interestingly enough, the more active a personbecomes, the more fit they get, and the more fit they get, the moreactive they become. Is there no end to how wonderful this is?18Senior Fitness

Research has shown that a forty-five-year-old man who has less
than four of the negative health traits described in the Assessmentwill live an average of eleven years longer than a man who has fiveor more of the negative health traits. Researchers found that only 12percent of those who started out with few or no unhealthy habitsbecame disabled over the next decade. This is compared to thosewho had many poor health habits and were more likely to becomeill, disabled, or die within ten years.

Keep in mind that clients have several ages: (1) chronological age,
(2) physiological age, (3) emotional age, and (4) intellectual age.For most people each age is different. Visit www.realage.com foranother helpful assessment tool devised with this principle in mind.Real age is defined here as “the biological age of your body, based onhow well you’ve maintained it.” Answering a series of questions20Senior Fitness

about daily habits and lifestyle choices generates feedback and sug-

The Top Ten Benefits of Exercise
for Older Adults
1. Maintenance of a high level of physical and social
activity increases the quality of life, enhancing social
satisfaction.
2. Increased independence is enjoyed when fitness and
health are maintained. Most Americans fear infirmityand dependence more than death.
3. A person has more energy and can perform daily rou-
tines with greater ease.
4. Increased muscle tone and flexibility improve balance,
decreasing falls.
5. The more muscle tissue a person maintains, the high-
er his metabolism, making it easier to control weight.
6. Calories burned through exercise allow a person to
rake in more nutrients.
7. Exercise delays loss of bone mass.
8. Posture improves, decreasing backache and enhanc-
ing appearance.
9. Cardio-respiratory function is enhanced, improving
peripheral circulation and decreasing risk of athero-
sclerosis, high blood pressure, and other circulatoryproblems.
10. Using it keeps you from losing it!22Senior Fitness
The bottom line is that physical fitness is the key to both mental
and physical health for the older adult. If a person wishes to agesuccessfully, they must commit to engaging in a program of sys-tematic exercise.
# Unit Summary
I. Aging is inevitable, but various factors affect how each
individual ages.
II. Exercise has been proven to increase length and quali-
ty of life.
III. A positive mental attitude is key to healthy aging.
a. Fitness professionals must arm their older clients
with current information about wellness.
b. Both trainer and client must embrace the truth that
health is distinct from youth.
IV. Premature aging is as much the result of disuse and
abuse of the body as it is the passage of time.
a. All of the changes commonly associated with aging
are also associated with physical inactivity.
b. While aging is inevitable, as much as 70 percent of
the way an individual ages is connected to lifestyle
and is thus in his or her own hands.
V. Our bodies are programmed for longevity, and by
remaining or becoming active, we can improve boththe quality and quantity of years we have left.The purpose of exercise is not to make senior athletes out of all
older adults or even to extend their life span, but rather to offerolder adults the opportunity and capability to be able to do what-ever they wish to do. Whether they want to have adequate strengthto get out of a chair and go for a walk, or to play catch with theirgrandchildren, or even to go on a vacation that they always wantedto take, exercise can help them do it. (I have an older friend at thegym who told me the only reason she exercises is so that she is fitenough to take advantage of the over-seventy-five-years-of-age skifree program!)
The key is to design a fitness program that matches the client’s goals
not the trainer’s goals.

“NORMAL” EFFECTS OF AGING
As mentioned before, many of the characteristics we associate with
aging, such as brittle bones, stooped posture, a shuffling gait, andweak muscles, are the effects of “typical” aging, not healthy aging.Fortunately, the effects of healthy aging are very different. Later inthis manual, we will see the positive influence exercise has on manyof these effects. For now, though, let’s review some of the signs, orbiomarkers , commonly associated with aging.
• Metabolism slows down as we age. (Calorie
requirements drop by 2 to 10 percent for each
decade over the age of thirty.)biomarker(s):  a sign or
symptom associated with aprocess or phenomenon, asin the process of aging.
metabolism: The total of
all the chemical and physi-
cal processes by which thebody builds and maintainsitself (anabolism) and bywhich it breaks down itssubstances for the produc-tion of energy (catabolism).
osteoporosis: Abnormal
loss of bony tissue resulting
in fragile porous bonesattributable to a lack of cal-cium; most common inpostmenopausal women.• Muscle mass decreases.
• Muscular strength is reduced.• Body fat levels increase, likely due to decreased
activity.
• There is decreased bone mass and increased bone
porosity, degeneration of the vertebral discs, and
osteoporosis .
• The joints stiffen and the bone structure becomes
less firm, which often results in a loss of height and
a stooped posture. Breathing, urination, and defe-cation can be impaired by these changes.
• Cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped with
each beat of the heart) declines, decreasing theefficiency of the heart as a pump.
• The heart muscle loses strength. Simultaneously,
the hardening and shrinking of the arteries (arte-riosclerosis) make it more difficult for blood to flowfreely throughout the body. The body may com-
pensate with an increase in the
systolic blood
pressure .The increased workload placed on the
heart and circulatory system can lead to strokes
and heart attacks.
• Blood cholesterol levels may increase.
• There is an increased tendency towards hyperten-
sion in some individuals as a result of increased
peripheral vascular resistance.
• Aerobic capacity (VO 2max) decreases.
• The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the
lungs may become more difficult as the respiratorysystem of the older person becomes less efficient.This loss of efficiency may be a result of a weaken-ing of the muscles and changes in the joints of theribs and chest. The fibers of the lungs may losetheir elasticity, and the blood vessels may harden.The result is that it becomes more difficult for theolder person to breathe.26Senior Fitness
systolic blood pressure:Blood pressure during thecontraction of the heartmuscle.
Aerobic capacity (VO 2
max): The highest rate of
oxygen consumption of
which a person is capable.Also referred to as maximaloxygen uptake.
cataracts: An eye disease
that involves the clouding
or opacification of the nat-ural lens of the eye. • The gastrointestinal system can change leading to
different dietary demands, and the frequency ofurination increases.
• Kidney filtration declines. The kidney filtration rate
of a seventy-five-year-old is 60 percent of the rateof that of a thirty-year-old.
• There is degeneration of the nerve cell body as
reflected by a decreased number of cells and achange in cell size—this is generally associated withdecreased nerve conduction velocity, resulting inslower reaction and movement times.
• The nervous system is altered in part because of a
loss in the bulk of the brain. Brain weight in a sev-enty-five-year-old is about 92 percent of that of athirty-year-old.
• Reflexes and reaction time are slowed.
• Visual acuity diminishes. Less light reaches the reti-
na in an aging eye, and the lens often acquires a
yellow cast.
Cataracts are often found.
• Taste and smell become less sensitive.
• The skin changes in appearance, becoming darker,
more pigmented, and more vulnerable to bruising
and skin sores. Skin also loses elasticity.
• The sensations of touch and pain are altered.
• The net effect is often that the individual feels less
capable of mastering his or her environment and
becomes increasingly depressed and isolated.
Regular and prudent exercise can halt and maybe even reverse some
of these common characteristics of typical aging.

# Theories On Aging
Two major groups of theories are being advanced by scientists to
further our understanding of aging. One group of theories holdsthat aging follows a biological timetable, perhaps a continuation ofthe one that regulates childhood growth and development. Theother major group of theories emphasizes environmental assaultsto our systems that gradually cause things to go wrong. Becausethese theories of aging are not mutually exclusive, it seems unlikelythat one theory will ever be able to describe the process of aging inits entirety. A brief and very simplified summary of some of themajor theories being proposed follows.
LIFESPAN/METABOLIC TIME SPAN THEORY
Numerous theories exist about the causes of aging. Dr. Schneiderat the USC Andrus Gerontology Center states, “if you think cancer
is complex, look at aging.” T oday,most experts agree that the agingprocess arises from a multitude ofparallel and interconnecting factors.One of these factors may be a theo-retical metabolic time limit. Thepremise is that the metabolic timelimit is preset and is passed from onegeneration to the next. For yearswe’ve known that certain animalshave fairly predictable life spans.Elephants usually live approximatelyseventy years, horses about forty
years, and mice survive about two to three years. The human lifespan is not as predictable.
Human mortality is characterized according to three phases of the
life span. In the first phase, the longer you live the longer you areexpected to live. After the first few months and years of life, deathrates drop drastically. For example, the longer a newborn survives,the better are his or her chances for a normal life span. During the28Senior Fitness

second phase, between the ages of ten and forty, the death rate is
generally quite low. During stage three, the range between age fortyand one hundred, the individual has already lived at least severalyears longer than expected and the mortality rate climbs rapidly. Theaverage life expectancy of infants born in 1930 was sixty-two yearsfor girls and fifty-eight years for boys. T oday, those same females andmales, now in their mid-sixties, can anticipate living until ageseighty-four and eighty, respectively.
Some of that increased longevity is due simply to statistics: as you
get older, your life expectancy automatically expands, since the pos-sibility of dying young, which drags the average down, no longerapplies. I have a friend who understands this quite well. While at hisone hundred third birthday party, I asked if he thought he’d makeit to one hundred four. He said statistics show very few people diebetween one hundred three and one hundred four!
Lifespan or metabolic time span theory is only one of many in this
group. Some examples of theories in this group follow.

endocrine system:
System consisting of theglands and tissues thatrelease hormones. It workswith the nervous system in regulating metabolicactivities.
immune system:
Complex and integratedbody system of organs, tissues, cells, and cell prod-ucts such as antibodies that differentiates self fromnon-self and protects theorganism from potentiallypathogenic organisms orsubstances.Programmed and Metabolic Theory Examples
Programmed Senescence : Aging is the result of the sequential
switching on and off of certain genes, with senescence being
defined as the time when age-associated deficits are manifested.
Endocrine Theory: Biological clocks act through hormones to con-
trol the pace of aging.
Immunological Theory: A programmed decline in immune system
functions leads to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseaseresulting in greater age-related characteristics that influence death.
# Extrinsic And Error Theories
Many things we associate with aging, such as fragile bones, forget-fulness, and loss of strength, are brought about partially due toextrinsic factors like mental and/or physical inactivity. In otherwords each of us ages at our own pace. Many of the changes that weexpect with the passage of timecan be positively influenced withthe inclusion of sensible and regu-lar exercise. Failure to use ourmuscles and other bodily systemsregularly can result in prematureaging, either from disuse or fromdevelopment of disease.
In 1961, scientists at the Vistar
Institute of Anatomy and Biologyfound that certain human cellscalled fibroblasts have a finite
capacity to duplicate or divide. When cells from older adults werecompared to those of younger adults, whose do you think had thegreater capacity to divide? Y es—the younger person’s. Anotherinteresting fact scientists discovered was that people with “Werner’sSyndrome” (a disease that results in premature aging and ultimate-ly death) show a reduced capability to replicate their cells when30Senior Fitness

nective tissue that moveinto adjacent tissues to help repair damage andform scar tissue.
compared to others of the same age without the disease. Examples
of theories in the extrinsic group are presented below.
Error Theory Examples
W ear and T ear: Cells and tissues have vital parts that wear out.
Rate of Living : The greater the rate of oxygen basal metabolism, the
shorter the life span.Cross-linking: The accumulation of cross-linked proteins damages
cells and tissues, thereby slowing down bodily processes.
Free Radicals : Accumulated damage caused by oxygen radicals
causes cells and eventually organs to stop functioning.Error Catastrophe: Damage to mechanisms that synthesize protein
results in faulty proteins, which accumulate to a level that causescatastrophic damage to cells, tissues, and organs.
Somatic Mutation : Genetic mutations occur and accumulate with
increasing age, causing cells to deteriorate and malfunction.Aging and ways to circumvent aging have been fascinating topics
since the beginning of time. Even the most respected scientists andgerontologists don’t fully understand the mechanisms of aging.
In 2003, Dr. James Fries, a Stanford University physician, told the
U.S. Senate Committee of Appropriation that older adults couldimprove their quality of life and delay disabling conditions and ill-ness if they would adopt a healthy lifestyle, thus compressing theirperiod of morbidity. In support of his claim, researchers at theCooper Clinic found that regular exercise may cut hospital staysand doctor visits for serious or minor illness by almost 50 percent.We now know that regular exercise is not only the fountain ofyouth, it is also the foundation for successful aging. Proper healthstyle behaviors and sensible exercise would not only prevent diseaseand untimely death, but would improve the quality of life.

MEN’S AND WOMEN’S HEALTH ISSUES
Though life expectancy has increased for both men and women,
there continues to be a difference in longevity. Let’s examine someof the issues affecting this trend.
MEN’S HEALTH ISSUES
Statistics reveal that, on the whole, women outlive men. Considerthe following:
• For every 100 women that die between the ages of
45 and 65, 170 men die!
• Men are 88% more likely to die of heart disease at
a younger age than women.
• Men are 45% more likely to die from cancer than
women.
More and more research shows that exercise helps lower the risk ofmajor chronic disease and premature death. Researchers at theCooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas studied nearly10,000 men (ages twenty to eighty-two). Among that group 3,000had a history of heart disease, stroke, cancer, high blood pressure,or diabetes. The least fit men in each group were classified as“unfit.” When researchers compared the fit group with the unfitgroup, the unfit group had a higher rate of death.32Senior Fitness

The unfit men who exercised their way to physical fitness cut their
overall death rate by nearly half (after adjusting for age, health sta-tus, and other risk factors for premature death) when compared tothose who stayed out-of-shape. And the men who were already fitcut their risk by almost one third by increasing their exercise. Thosemen who got in shape actually cut their mortality rate as signifi-cantly as smokers who gave up smoking cigarettes.
WOMEN’S HEALTH ISSUES
Much of the early research on disease and premature death was direct-ed at men because so many men had heart attacks that cost health dol-lars and took them away from the workforce early. Now we see equaldollars being spent on both women’s and men’s health issues.
Heart disease is currently the number one killer of American
women 65 years of age and older; breast cancer is number two.Presently, there is a large study underway, funded by the NationalInstitute of Health, at Stanford University and forty other centersnationwide. This study is looking at the health habits of womenwho are fifty years of age. About 628 million dollars are being spent,and most of the major health issues affecting women hopefully willbe known. The study will look at whether or not hormone replace-ment affects women adversely by placing them at greater risk forBiomarkers of Aging

I. “Normal” aging includes such symptoms of physical
decline as decreases in muscle mass, cardiac output,
and aerobic capacity; an increase in blood cholesterollevels; degeneration of the nerve cells; an increase inbody fat; changes in the skin; and stiffening of thejoints and weakening of the bone structure.
II. Two major groups of theories on aging are being

IX. Personality
The only thing that is absolutely known about aging is that every-
body does it.
Individuals age at widely varying rates. In fact, within the same per-
son, organs and organ systems show different rates of decline.However, some generalizations can be made based on data from theBaltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. It is important to remem-ber, however, that these conditions will not apply to all people. Thefollowing section is designed to give you an idea of some of themost common changes that can occur with age in various organsand systems.
# Lungs
Vital capacity (VC) is the maximum amount of air that can bemoved out of the lungs during a single breath, following a maximalinspiration. The elasticity of the lungs directly affects vital capacity,vital capacity (VC):
Maximal breathing capaci-ty; the amount of air thatcan be expired after a max-imum inspiration; the maxi-mum total volume of thelungs, less the residual vol-ume. The usable portion ofthe lungs.
and age and inactivity affect elasticity. Vital capacity may decline by
about 40 percent between the ages of twenty and seventy.
Maximum oxygen uptake is also affected by age and is often used as
a measure of total body fitness. Maximum oxygen uptake, or VO 2
max, is the greatest amount of oxygen that can be utilized by theentire body (at a cellular level). However, this measure of oxygenutilization does not depend only on the lungs, but also on the heartand circulatory system.
Physical conditioning determines how well our bodies transport
oxygen. Age and inactivity can decrease the ability to transport andutilize oxygen effectively. Maximal oxygen consumption duringexercise declines in men by about 10 percent with each decade ofadult life; in women VO 2drops by about 7.5 percent per decade.
Using various treatments and medicines, a physician can improvean individual’s ability to transport oxygen and increase blood oxy-gen content by 5 to 10 percent, but that is only a fraction of whatcan be accomplished through regular exercise and increased phys-ical fitness. 38Senior Fitness

stroke volume: The vol-
ume of blood pumped out
of the heart into the circu-latory system by the leftventricle in one contrac-tion.
dendrites: The branched
projections of a neuron that
act to conduct the electro-chemical stimulationreceived from other neuralcells to the cell body, orsoma, of the neuron fromwhich the dendrites project.
axons: An axon or nerve
fiber is a long, slender pro-
jection of a nerve cell, orneuron, that conducts elec-trical impulses away fromthe neuron’s cell body orsoma.
dementia: A progressive
decline in cognitive func-
tion due to damage or dis-ease in the brain beyondwhat might be expectedfrom normal aging. Areasparticularly affected includememory, attention, judge-ment, language and prob-lem solving.
Alzheimer’s: A degenera-
tive brain disorder charac-
terized by premature senili-ty and dementia.
urinary incontinence:
Inability to control the flowof urine and involuntaryurination.HEART
There is a decrease in elasticity and an
increase in stiffness of the arteries as weage, which contributes to an increase inblood pressure. The heart muscleweakens and cardiac output (the prod-uct of stroke volume and heart rate)
decreases. Exercise can reverse or lessenthis decline.
# Brain
With age, the brain loses some cells (neu-rons), and others become damaged.However, the brain adapts by increasingthe number of connections (synapses)between cells and by re-growing thebranch-like extensions (dendrites and
axons) that carry messages. Physical exer-
cise has been shown to improve motor skills and cognitive skills.New research also suggests that keeping the blood pressure withinthe ideal range may prevent dementia and Alzheimer’s.

As a person ages, the kidneys graduallybecome less efficient at extractingwastes from the blood. This decrease inefficiency is partially attributed to thegeneral decrease in size of the kidneysthat occurs with age, and also thedecrease in blood or plasma flow to thekidneys. Bladder capacity declines andtissues atrophy, sometimes resulting inurinary incontinence, which can oftenbe managed with exercise and behav-ioral techniques.

lean muscle mass: The
amount of muscular tissue
that the person has in rela-tion to total body mass.
sarcopenia: The degener-
ative loss of muscle mass
related to aging.
Type II fibers: The fast
twitch muscle fibers of the
body that are responsiblefor high levels of strength.BODY FAT
Body fat increases with age, commonly from a combination of
acquiring more storage fat from sedentary living and redistributionof existing stored fats. Women are more likely to store it in the lowerbody—hips and thighs. Men will tend to carry their stored fat in theabdominal area. An unhealthy change in body composition hasmany health risks associated with it, but these risks can be reducedwith physical activity.
# Muscle
Lean muscle mass is the amount of muscular tissue that the person
has in relation to total body mass. Sarcopenia is the term used to
describe the degenerative loss of muscle mass related to aging. Theaverage decline in muscle mass between the ages of thirty and sev-enty has been measured at 22 percent for women and 23 percent formen. Type II fibers, the muscle fibers responsible for high levels of
strength, have been shown in some studies to decrease as much as50 percent in men by the age of eighty. Strength training can pre-vent loss of muscle mass and help in regaining the lean mass anindividual may have already lost. 40Senior Fitness

# Sight
Difficulty focusing close up may begin
around age forty; the ability to distinguishfine details may begin to decline in one’sseventies. From age fifty on, there isincreased susceptibility to glare, greaterdifficulty in seeing at low levels of illumi-nation, and more difficulty in detecting
moving targets. Less than 15 percent of the population over eightyyears of age has 20/20 vision.
# Hearing
It becomes more difficult to hear higherfrequencies with age, with loss of hearingactually beginning as early as age twenty.Hearing declines more quickly in menthan in women. It is estimated that asmany as 65 percent of people reaching ageeighty have some significant hearing loss.
# Personality
After about age thirty, personalityis stable. Sudden changes in per-sonality sometimes suggest diseaseprocesses. Senility, dementia, andorganic brain syndromes are allconditions that affect the brainwith age and consequently canaffect the personality of the personafflicted. Alzheimer’s, a progres-sive type of dementia that impairsmemory, judgment, and personal-
ity, accounts for half of all reported cases of dementia. Many olderadults suffer from depression, due to the losses that often occur.Some studies have found that mild-to-moderate exercise decreases

the depression. Often a positive side effect of exercise is the social
aspects of it, in addition to the improvement in self-esteem.
The bottom line is that almost everything that gets worst with age
can be positively influenced with a regular dose of mild-to-moder-ate physical activity. 42Senior Fitness

While no magic pill exists to stop aging or prevent disease and dis-
ability, exercise is an intervention that is inexpensive, has no sideeffects, and if taken regularly can prevent many ailments seen inolder people. It can even slow down the aging process.  Scientists aresuggesting that we need not have a steady decline starting in ourthirties but that we can live successfully until our eighties before ourbody systems start to slow down and break down.
hypokinetic disease:
A disease related to, orcaused by, insufficient activity and lack of regularexercise.In addition to having good
genes, eating a sound diet,and getting proper medicalcare, regular physical activityis essential to successfulaging. Some experts evensuggest that regular physicalactivity is more importantthan diet—possibly moreimportant than healthy cho-lesterol levels—and thatbeing fit and overweight isbetter than not being fit andbeing of normal weight. Astudy conducted jointly bythe American College ofSports Medicine and theCenter for Disease Control
found that 12 percent of deaths in Americans are indirectly relatedto the lack of exercise or what we call hypokinetic disease . This
might be better known as “couch potato syndrome.” With all of theattention exercise is receiving, it is depressing that only one in fourAmericans gets enough of it.
Some people discount exercise because they believe longevity is all
in the genes. It is true that living a long and healthy life is depend-ent upon many factors including genetics. Genetic research hasshown that one’s genetic make-up plays a key part in overall healthand longevity. Studies of identical and non-identical twins showthat life spans of identical twins are remarkably similar (identicaltwins have the same genes). Identical twins died within two to fouryears of each other, whereas non-identical twins died an average ofseven years apart. Experts agree, however, that only 30% of longevi-ty is in the genes. That leaves 70% that is determined by healthhabits and environment.46Senior Fitness

The Journal of the American Medical Association stated that even a
minimal amount of exercise, such as a thirty-minute brisk walk two
times a week, is enough to protect the body against cardiovasculardisease and cancer. The research also indicates that people, whoexercise or are active, even in short duration, tend to live longer andbetter than those who do not exercise at all.
Preventive gerontology starts in childhood with well baby care,
good nutrition, regular medical check-ups, and proper exercise.However, to maintain good health, older adults need all of thesethings, plus social connectedness and functional exercise.
The motto we should teach our clients is: what you do today will
determine how you age tomorrow. The results of misusing the bodyare cumulative and many times take years to manifest themselves.
Hippocrates was well ahead of his time when he said, “Speaking gen-
erally, all parts of the body which have function, if used in moderation
and exercised in labours to which each is accustomed, become therebyhealthy and well developed, and age slowly, but if unused and left idle,they become liable to disease, defective in growth, and age quickly.”
Unfortunately, it only took the medical profession and fitness com-
munity 2000 years to prove this.
Aging affects all the systems of the body. We now know that people
do not grow too old to exercise, but rather grow old from lack ofexercise. As we said earlier, exercise physiologists have proven atrained and fit seventy-year-old year old person is equivalent intheir oxygen carrying capacity to an untrained, unfit, sedentaryforty-year-old person. We also understand that various medicalinterventions can improve the body’s ability to transport oxygen byabout 5 to 10 percent, but that is only a fraction of what can beaccomplished through exercise and improved cardiopulmonary fit-ness. The specific benefits of exercise on various systems of thebody will be presented in this unit.

collateral circulation: An
area of tissue or an organ
has a number of differentpathways for blood toreach it. This is often as aresult of anastamoses -branches formed betweenadjacent blood vessels.CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
The health and efficiency of our cardiorespiratory system can limit
our functional abilities. Structural and anatomical changes takeplace that affect our ability to exercise. Some unfit older adultsexperience shortness of breath or fatigue easily when participatingin simple activities. Specifically, with normal aging and in theabsence of disease, we see a decrease in both the size of the heartand the ability of the heart to efficiently pump blood. Since heartvalves become more rigid and thick with age, the phrase “hard-hearted old guy” is in fact accurate.
# Vascular Adaptations To Training
Within the last twenty years, studies have explained the linkbetween cardiovascular health and regular aerobic exercise. Inactivepeople are one and one-half to two times more likely to have a heartattack, and the chances of dying immediately after that heart attackare three times greater than for physically active people. Said anoth-er way, active people are less likely to have a heart attack, and if theydo, they are more likely to survive due to collateral circulation.
Collateral circulation occurs when auxiliary vessels increase circu-
lation for coronary arteries that have become narrowed or clogged,
like when the freeway is blocked and you take the back roads to getto your destination. Collateral circulation is the route the bloodtakes to keep your heart alive until the medical staff can unblock theroad. Exercise increases the development of collateral vessels.
# Blood Pressure
As we age, our blood pressure increases. The belief is that the arterywalls lose their elasticity with age and become hardened, a condi-tion that affects the ability of the blood to flow freely. Generally,blood pressure that is consistently 150/90 is reason for concern.Some researchers contend that a greater difference between theupper number and lower number of the blood pressure representsan increased risk of heart attack. Recent research also suggests a linkbetween high blood pressure and Alzheimer’s Disease.48Senior Fitness
# Heart Disease
Research shows that age alone does not wear out the heart. Disuse,
misuse, and disease do. In a comprehensive study involving womenwith heart disease who exercised, researchers found that moderateexercise, such as brisk walking several times a week, cut heart attackrisk by up to 50 percent. Another study that analyzed 73,000women enrolled in the Boston-based Nurse’s Health Study, foundthat physical activity reduced the risk of stroke by more than 40percent. This was one of the first strong suggestions that exerciseworks as well for women as it does for men.
An interesting study completed by Dr. Hervert DeVries found that
a group of older men, followed through forty-two weeks of vigor-ous conditioning improved the way their bodies consumed oxygenand how their lungs took in and used air. (The body’s ability to useoxygen efficiently is a sign of fitness.) Another landmark studywhich revealed that older adults can improve cardiovascular fitnessas they age was performed by Dr. Fred Kasch at San Diego StateUniversity. Dr. Kasch carefully observed fifteen men, aged forty-fiveto sixty-five, for more than twenty years, and what he found shouldbe reassuring to all of us. These men maintained a healthy body

weight and their oxygen-carrying ability only decreased by 12 per-
cent rather than the 40 to 50 percent that usually occurs with aging.This demonstrates that getting slower and tiring easily is notinevitable with age.
Benefits of Exercise for the
Cardiovascular System
• Increase in work capacity
• Decrease in resting heart rate• Decrease in total cholesterol• Increase in HDL cholesterol (“good” cholesterol)• Decrease in blood pressure• Increase in oxygen consumption
# Respiratory System
As has already been mentioned, vital capacity is the maximum
amount of air that can be moved out of the lungs during a singlebreath, following a maximal inspiration. The elasticity of the lungsdirectly affects vital capacity. Age and inactivity affect elasticity, andvital capacity may decline by about 40 percent between ages twentyand seventy.
Although the breathing muscles can be strengthened with exercise,
most changes to the lungs are irreversible. Fortunately, though,because of the large reserve capacity of the lungs, these changes canbe tolerated quite well. Older adults can demonstrate improve-ments in maximal oxygen consumption similar to their youngercounterparts though it may take longer to achieve such enhancedfunction. An older adult participating in an aerobics program may50Senior Fitness
submaximal heart rate:
Equates to about 70 to 85percent of maximal heartrate (MHR).enjoy a number of improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness such
as a decrease in submaximal heart rate, a faster recovery heart rate,and a decrease in systolic blood pressure at rest and during exercise.And not only do good physiological benefits occur with regularexercise, but an older adult with respiratory dysfunction can expe-rience psychological and social benefits from a regular aerobic exer-cise program as well. These benefits include decreased anxiety andtension, improved self-confidence and self-esteem, and a sense ofwell-being.
The evidence is in: older people can improve heart and lung func-
tion. Remember, all it takes is a mild to moderate program, three tofour times per week, at a light intensity, which is 60 to 70 percent ofmaximum heart rate. It is important to remember that some indi-viduals may need to begin at an intensity below 60 percent of theirmaximum heart rate and start at a duration of ten minutes or lessand gradually increase to twenty or thirty minutes. Others mayhave a good aerobic capacity but lack the muscular endurance toperform the aerobic activities. This will require them to start slow-ly. The most important thing to do is move and move regularly.Remind your clients that it is not how hard they work but howoften they work. It is better for older adults to exercise a little everyday than to exercise a lot once or twice a week.
Benefits of Exercise for the
Respiratory System
• Decrease in minute ventilation (number of
breaths per minute)
• Increase in vital capacity
• Decrease in respiratory exchange ratio

bone density: (or bone
mineral density) is a med-
ical term referring to theamount of matter persquare centimeter ofbones.[1] Note that this isnot a true “density”, whichwould be measured in massper cubic area. It is meas-ured by a procedure calleddensitometry, often per-formed in the radiology ornuclear medicine depart-ments of hospitals or clin-ics. The measurement ispainless and non-invasiveand involves minimal radia-tion exposure.Measurements are mostcommonly made over thelumbar spine and over theupper part of the hip.[2]The forearm is scanned ifeither the hip or the lumbarspine can’t be. Averagedensity is around 1500 kgm-3.MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM

Bone Density
It is projected by 2020 half of all Americans over fifty will be at risk
for a bone fracture. Some women begin to lose bone mineral massduring their thirties, and men begin to lose it at about age fifty.Women lose approximately 1 percent per year until menopause,when the pace accelerates to between 2 and 4 percent per year forfour to five years, then returns to about 1 percent per year. By theage of seventy, some women have a total loss of bone mass of near-ly 30 percent. Men, on the other hand, lose about 0.5 percent peryear and generally are not at risk for spontaneous fractures untilthey are in their eighties. This gradual, but continual decrease inbone mass in women and elderly men results in structural weaken-ing and poses a high risk of spontaneous fractures.
An estimated 1.3 million fractures occur each year because of
osteoporosis, and they cost billions of dollars to repair and rehabil-itate. Research shows that once an older woman has broken her hip,rarely will she return to her pre-fracture health status. Also, it hasbeen reported that older women who suffer from hip fractures havea 30 to 50 percent death rate in the first year after the fracture.Demographically, osteoporosis is more prominent in white, slenderwomen than in African-American women. It also appears that if aperson has a larger amount of bone mass when young, this will pro-vide protection from bone problems later in life.
The causes of osteoporosis are multi-factorial and therefore are dif-
ficult to isolate. Genetic and environmental factors interact to affectthe rate of bone loss and the integrity of the remaining structure.Metabolic disorders involving the digestive system, renal function,diabetes, and hormonal levels increase the rate of bone loss. Poorlifestyle habits such as insufficient calcium and vitamin D intake,physical inactivity, and smoking can further accelerate bone loss.52Senior Fitness
Physical activity is necessary for maintaining bone material content
and serves as a stimulus for increasing bone mass. Studies haveshown that immobility leads to bone loss and that the stress ofweight-bearing exercise builds up mineral mass.
Wolfe’s Law states that the robustness of a bone is in
direct proportion to the load placed upon it.
If we can prevent falls and lessen the negative impact of those thatoccur, we will be able to drastically improve the quality of life formany older adults. Decreased bone density accounts for manyinjuries in seniors, but that risk can be lessened with regular activi-ty. Research has shown that forty to fifty minutes of weight-bearingaerobic exercise performed three to four days per week appears toadequately maintain bone mass, thereby preventing osteoporosis inolder adults. Aerobic exercise without weight-bearing activity is not
as important to the treatment of osteoporosis as isometric orweight lifting exercise. Basically stated, weight-bearing aerobic exer-cise and weight training are the best ways to increase bone density.
• Even women with bone densities near fracture
threshold levels can increase bone density with
appropriate exercise.
• Bone density returns to pre-exercise levels when
women stop exercising.
• Many nutritionists believe that avoiding soft
drinks can help maintain bone density becausea chemical contained in these drinks extracts
calcium from the bones.

Bone Density Studies
The findings on hip fractures, first reported in the January 1991
issue of Epidemiology, indicate that women who actively exercisedaily are 40 percent less likely to fall. Active exercises identified inthe study were such activities as biking, tennis, jogging, vigorouswalking, dancing, and resistance training exercise programs. Lessvigorous activities were golfing, gardening, and household chores.Findings suggest that minimally strenuous activities do not sub-stantially reduce the risk of hip fractures.
An intervention study by Harry K. Genant, M.D., Director of
Osteoporosis Research at the University of California, San Francisco,demonstrated that increases in bone mineral density beyond theteen years is possible. In the study, sixty-three women who ranged inage from twenty to thirty-five years were randomly assigned to exer-cising and non-exercising groups. The exercisers engaged in aerobicsand weight training for one hour, three times per week. In a double-blind design, all participants received either calcium supplements upto a total of 1500 milligrams per day or a placebo.
After two years, the exercisers had increased bone mineral density
at all four sites measured: the spinal trabeculae, femoral neck, cal-caneus and trochanter. They also improved in physical fitness meas-ures. Calcium supplementation had no significant effect, perhapsbecause the women in the study already had a fairly high calciumintake, Genant said. The message, according to the researchers, isthat women in their twenties can continue to build bone with amodest investment of time and effort. Women can affect their bonemass in the third decade just by participating in recreational sportstwo to three times per week.
As mentioned earlier, research has shown that forty to fifty minutes
of aerobic, weight-bearing exercise performed three to four days perweek appears to adequately maintain bone mass, thereby preventingosteoporosis in older adults. Most of the research investigating theeffects of exercise on cardiovascular disorders and osteoporosis has54Senior Fitness
been done with aerobic training. It seems reasonable to assume that
similar effects may occur with resistance training.
After recently completing a year-long study on the use of exercise in
improving bone density in women over the age of fifty, Dr. StanleyJ. Birge, Clinical Director of Washington University’s program onaging at Jewish Hospital, concluded that exercise may be used byyounger women and older women to reverse the effects of osteo-porosis. Birge’s study included twenty-two women ages fifty to sev-enty-two, including control subjects. “Even those women with bonedensities near the fracture threshold could increase their bone den-sity with appropriate exercise,” Birge said. He found that bone den-sity went back to baseline levels if the women stopped exercising,but if they continued, it was maintained.
Other recent studies have found that while swimming does little to
improve bone mass, water exercise performed vigorously mayimprove bone mass some. Until further studies are done, though,the best bet if you are concerned about osteoporosis is to combineswimming or water exercise with some type of weight-bearingactivity such as walking or weight-lifting. The key is to expose thebones to stresses that slightly exceed what is normally encountered.

hypertrophy: Increase in
both gross muscle size as
well as individual musclecell size resulting fromtraining (especially weighttraining); due to the adap-tive process whereby themuscles add more mito-chondria, sarcoplasm,myofibrils, interstitial sub-stances such as water, fat,satellite cells, etc. inresponse to highly specificforms of stress.MUSCULAR SYSTEM
By adolescence we are equipped with all the muscle cells we will
have. After that time, a muscle can either get bigger or smaller.When we build muscles ( hypertrophy ) we enlarge the muscle cell.
The opposite is the shrinking of the muscle cell or atrophy. By thetime most people are seventy years of age, they have lost about 25percent of their muscle mass due to disuse. In some cases the loss ofstrength is so severe a person cannot climb or descend stairs, or risefrom a chair without pushing up with their hands.
Strength training can prevent loss of muscle mass and help in
regaining the muscle mass you may have already lost. This is criti-cal for many older adults who lose about three to five ounces ofmuscle mass per year. According to one respected researcher, when
we strip away the fat and skin in anautopsy, we find very skinny old peoplewith regard to muscle mass.
Strength in men is maximal between
the ages of thirty to thirty-five yearsand remains relatively constant untilaround age fifty, after which time itdeclines. The rate of decline in muscu-lar strength with age appears to beslightly less in the upper extremities(small muscle groups) than in the back
and legs (large muscle groups.) Leg and back muscle strengthdeclines by 40 percent. Men who are eighty years old may exhibit a40 percent lower muscle mass than men who are thirty years old.Between middle age and old age, overall body weight drops 10 per-cent, and this is attributed to a decline in lean muscle mass.
Sarcopenia
“Frailty” is used to describe the loss of muscle and strength oftenseen in older people because it’s a word with which most people arefamiliar. The problem is that “frailty” has more than one meaning.56Senior Fitness

Sarcopenia is a better term because it indicates both loss of muscle
and strength, as well as the decreased quality of muscle tissue oftenseen in older adults. It’s a word you are very likely to hear moreabout in the future.
We know that muscle-building exercises can improve strength in
older adults, but many questions remain about muscle loss andaging. Researchers want to know, for example, if factors other thana sedentary lifestyle contribute to muscle loss. Does age itself causechanges in the muscles of older people? Is muscle loss related tochanges in hormones or nutrition? These are the kinds of questionsscientists are examining now. The answers may lead to ways ofhelping us keep our strength as we age.
Strength and Muscle Facts
1. Men and women generally achieve maximum
strength between the ages of twenty and thirty.
2. After age thirty, muscular strength declines.
3. A 20 percent decline in muscle strength usually
occurs between the ages of forty and sixty-five
and is attributed to age and disuse.
4. Muscle mass has been found to decrease from 35
percent to 46 percent after the age of sixty.
5. Reduced muscle mass is a factor responsible for
age-associated loss of strength.
6. The loss of muscle volume may be due to
reduced fiber size, particularly in the fast twitch(Type II) fibers seen in power/explosive activities.
7. By age sixty-five, most muscle groups show a loss
of maximal force.
8. Men and women can improve strength with age.

The Functional Aspects of Muscle Mass
and Strength
Dr. Herbert DeVries found that strength-training exercise has a
tremendous impact on the maintenance and development of mus-cle mass in the aging adult. The reductions in the musculoskeletalsystem seen in older adults result in reductions of muscle tone andsize which usually leads to an avoidance of heavy, physical activity,which leads to less strength, and a vicious circle of decline in func-tion and strength gets underway. Research has found that the majordeclines seen in muscle strength are not an expected outcome ofage. In a landmark study, ten frail men and women as old as nine-ty-six worked out with free weights, and within two months, par-ticipants had already boosted thigh muscle strength by an average58Senior Fitness
Figure 5-1 Reductions in the musculoskeletal system lead to reduced muscle tone and
size, which can result in an avoidance of physical activity. Decreased physical activity
reduces muscle tone and size even more, and a cycle of decline ensues.

of 174 percent, and muscle mass had increased by 9 percent. What
does this mean in real-life terms? Five volunteers who originallycould walk only one-fourth of a mile doubled their walking dis-tance. Two other volunteers who had previously needed canes towalk no longer needed them at all.
Tufts University scientist Miriam Nelson, Ph.D., maintains that,
“Our muscles have the ability to grow and get stronger from birthuntil we die.” By making a lifelong habit of even minimal weight-bearing exercise and resistance training (for 15 minutes a day, twotimes per week) we can maintain as much as 94 percent of our mus-cle mass well into old age.
Recent research shows that increased strength leads to improved
balance and functional mobility among older people. Myths aboutthe inability of older people to increase their strength are just that.Nearly every senior patient can benefit from basic resistance andstrength training programs.
In the 1970’s, we heard most exercise physiologists say that aerobic
exercise was critical. Unfortunately, in their enthusiasm to makethat point, they failed to remind us that fit people also need to com-bine both strength training and stretching exercises in addition tocardiovascular conditioning. T o be truly “physically fit,” a personmust incorporate all components of exercise.
According to experts at Tufts University, strength training is the sin-
gle most critical step in retarding the aging process. “If in fact wecan maintain muscle mass, many of these things we call ‘biomark-ers’ of aging might actually be biomarkers of inactivity,” the study’sDr. Evans says. Educators and physical trainers who work witholder adults on a daily basis have observed first hand that olderadults can increase their strength, and recent research shows thatimprovements in strength lead to functional improvements in theability to perform normal, daily activities more easily because,among other things, strength training improves balance and mobil-ity. All of this leads to the conclusion that a total fitness program

ing as well.
Body Composition and Muscle Mass
It is not uncommon for people to gain significant fat during mid-life, especially women. Body fat increases with age, commonly froma combination of acquiring more storage fat from sedentary livingand the redistribution of existing stored fat. This increase in bodyfat is of concern because of its possible relationship with diseaseand premature mortality. A study conducted at the HarvardUniversity School of Public Health, found that weight gains of aslittle as eleven to eighteen pounds in mid-life increased a woman’schances of having a heart attack by 25 percent. And as we know,heart disease is a major killer in both men and women.
Exercise is extremely important in managing body composition in
older adults. For decades, we’ve seen shriveled and non-energeticolder people and have accepted that as the norm. We have also seensubstantially overweight older people and have accepted that as thenorm. The old excuse was, “Oh, my metabolism has just sloweddown.” Scientists looking at metabolic rates in senior athletes havefound, however, that metabolism doesn’t really slow down thatmuch if the people stay active and if their muscle mass remains sim-ilar to when they were younger. The key factor to remember is thatfit, muscular people use more calories at rest than do sedentarypeople with little muscle mass. Exercise not only increases metabo-lism during exercise, but keeps it revved up for some time afterexercise. Also, muscle burns more calories at rest than fat, so themore muscles you have, the more calories you are burning.
Posture, Mobility, and Flexibility
The aging process as seen in the skeletal and muscular systems alsomanifests itself in areas where these two systems intersect. Poor pos-ture, for instance, contributes to major mobility problems in bothmen and women. Osteoporosis and fractures, along with vertebralligament calcification and muscle weakness, cause muscle imbal-60Senior Fitness
ances, which contribute to postural changes. Some posture changes
are so severe that they can eventually affect locomotion. Recent stud-ies indicate that women who had a pronounced “Dowagers Hump”could improve their posture by strengthening the upper back mus-cles and stretching the tight chest muscles. These types of exercisesalso simultaneously contribute to increasing bone mass.
People with arthritis can benefit from sensible strength training
because strength training adds stability to the joints, decreases pain,and in most cases increases mobility.
It is generally agreed that joints become less stable and mobile with
age. Aging is often associated with joint surface deterioration, jointstiffness, and loss of flexibility. In fact, some researchers believe thatosteoarthritis is a natural result of the aging process. It is difficult toseparate deterioration caused by aging from that caused by accu-mulated wear and tear. Trauma to joint cartilage results in the for-mation of scar tissue that causes the connective tissue to become

joint capsule that often contains debris, which in turn impairsrange of motion. Decreased range of motion in joints affects pos-ture, gait, balance and skeletal flexibility, increasing the potential forfalls and injury. The kyphosis that occurs with aging leads to
diminished stature and poor use of respiratory muscles. Breakdownof the joint cartilage leads to osteoarthritis and pain, reduced
mobility, and a diminished ability to accomplish daily activities.Osteoarthritis is generally referred to as the wear-and-tear disease.Osteoarthritis in the elderly principally shows up in those areasreceiving the most mechanical stress. It is unclear if the restrictedrange of motion found in the joints is principally the result of agingor of repeated trauma.
Range-of-motion exercises have been shown to increase flexibility
dramatically in a relatively short period of time. One study by
Munn showed increases in flexibility ranging from 8 percent in theshoulders to 48 percent in the ankles in only twelve weeks ofstretching and dance exercises. However, it is improbable that exer-cise can significantly undo damage to joints that have undergoneextensive degeneration. It is encouraging, though, that flexibilitycan still be increased in older adults aged seventy-two to ninety.Improvement over a two-year period showed an increase in flexi-bility of 11 percent from participation in flexibility classes three tofour times per week.
Opinions are varied in the fitness field concerning the relationship
between osteoarthritis and exercise, especially running. Animal andoccupational studies have demonstrated inconsistent results indetermining the effects of activity and the development ofosteoarthritis. Clinical studies have demonstrated that whenosteoarthritis has been found to exist, it seems to be related to bonymisalignment and prior traumatic injury, not to running. Somestudies have shown that running and regular athletic activity do notincrease the risk of osteoarthritis in those runners with normalanatomy and strength.62Senior Fitness

decrease in weight, and the interconnections among neurons maybe reduced. Exercise has a positive effect on both the physiologicaland psychological functions of the brain, however. Exercise and itseffect on mental capacity, mental flexibility, and general mentalhealth will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
# Mental Capacity
Dr. Marian Diamond of the University of California at Berkeleycontends there is mounting evidence that so long as disease doesnot intervene, the brain retains its capacity to grow new anatomicalconnections, to learn, and to function at high levels. As we age,mental capacity does not necessarily deteriorate, especially in peo-ple who continue to learn and think, who are well nourished, andwho exercise their bodies throughout their lives. What does thebrain need to function? It needs oxygen. How does it obtain oxy-gen? Oxygen is transported to the brain via the blood. The best way

to move oxygen-rich blood to the brain is through exercise. Exercise
can be responsible for a quicker and more alert brain.
From the thirties onward, there is a slight mental slowdown. Aging
affects reaction time, which determines how quickly you step on thebrake while driving or how fast you come up with the answers in“Jeopardy.” But other functions, such as vocabulary building, getbetter throughout your fifties and sixties. It is true that some men-tal skills do begin to decline around age seventy, but this variesgreatly from individual to individual.
In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, more than a quarter
of the volunteers over age seventy showed no decline in memory.Some continued to perform well on the cognitive tasks as theymoved into their eighties. The brain, like the heart, may do moreadapting and less declining with age than previously thought. Takeproblem solving, for example: when faced with a task, older peoplemay draw on different capacities to complete the task. Up to ageseventy, there is little or no decline in problem solving.64Senior Fitness

central nervous system:
System comprised of thebrain and spinal column.
psychomotor: Of, relat-
ing to, or characterizing
movements of the bodyassociated with mentalactivity.Exercise helps to maintain the integrity of the central nervous sys-
tem and psychomotor control, possibly due to increases in region-
al cerebral blood flow or elevated cerebral metabolism from
increased sensory stimulation and arousal. Hence, age-relateddecreases in reaction and movement times are minimized. Middle-aged exercisers, in other words, are blissfully unaware of what theyare not losing. A recent study found that older adults who did ball-room dancing, which combined learning dance steps with move-ment, lost less brain function. And the good news is that even lowintensity activities such as walking and biking can help.
# Mental Flexibility
Research has demonstrated that there is a strong associationbetween regular, vigorous exercise and successful aging. Some pre-liminary research even indicates that exercising can improve brainfunction in older people. The findings show that older adults whoare physically active have faster movement times than their younger,inactive counterparts. Robert Dustman, Chief of theNeuropsychology Laboratory at the Salt Lake City, Utah, Veteran’sAdministration Hospital, found that aerobically fit individuals intheir fifties did as well as those in their twenties. These people hadmore mental flexibility and adjusted more quickly to changing tasksthan did people their same age who were “couch potatoes.” Dr.Dustman postulates that the improved circulation associated withexercise produces this effect.
Another study analyzed women aged fifty-seven to eighty-five who
started exercising regularly, and showed that they were able to gainback some of the mental speed they had previously lost. Still otherstudies showed a dramatic difference in mental acuity (I.Q.)between men in their sixties who exercised and men who did not,as well as improvements in older adults’ ability to stay focused.
T o older adults, most of the mental benefits of exercise such as a
slower decline in memory or the ability to react more quickly whendriving are likely to go unnoticed. The slippage in memory and

physical response time is gradual and natural. Scientists now say it
is not inevitable, however.
Arthur Kramer, a University of Illinois psychologist, measured how
quickly forty sedentary adults between the ages of sixty-three andeighty-two responded simultaneously to two differently pitchedtones by hitting buttons. Half the adults went through a ten-weekwater aerobics course, three times a week for forty-five minutes ofexercise, while the others all remained sedentary. The results pub-lished in the Journal of Psychology and Aging (1992), showed
improvement in the exercisers’ speed at hitting laboratory buttons,while the non-exercisers showed no improvement. The regularexercisers responded more quickly upon hearing a tone than didthe sedentary group, even when the non-exercisers were younger bytwenty to fifty years. Normally, reaction time hits its peak whenpeople are in their twenties, begins a subtle decline in the thirties,and is on a downhill roll by the sixties. Dr. Kramer states, “Whatwe’re finding is that the decline in reaction time beginning in ourmid-thirties is not related to aging so much as to fitness level.”Another important benefit to point out is that with increased men-tal functioning comes increased mental health.
# Mental Health
Exercise can further boost quality of life by keeping people’s spiritsup as they age. Exercise not only keeps your body strong andhealthy, but can improve your mood as well. A team of Stanfordresearchers randomly assigned three-hundred-sixty people, agedfifty to sixty-five, either to an exercise group or to an inactive con-trol group. The study reported that people who exercised experi-enced improved mood and less depression. The ability to elevateone’s mood through physical activity is a breakthrough for olderadults, especially those for whom exercise may provide an alterna-tive to medication.66Senior Fitness
Benefits Seen in the Brain and Mental
Health with Exercise
• Improved ability to perform daily living activities
• Increased social interaction• Decreased levels of anxiety• Decreased levels of depression• Improved motivation• Improved self-esteem
In summary, statistics show that Americans are living longer. And
many older Americans don’t want to merely survive longer—theywant to thrive, be active, and stay independent as they age. Contraryto popular misconceptions, only 5 percent of older adults live ininstitutional settings. The majority of older adults are considered tobe healthy, despite various health issues. For the most part, themajority of older adults are independent and doing relatively well.
There are certain age-related changes that can’t be modified with
the intervention of exercise and healthy choices, such as graying ofthe hair, but fortunately there are many characteristics common toaging that can be positively influenced with regular exercise andsmart health choices. The Journal of the American MedicalAssociation stated that even a minimal amount of exercise—a brisk
thirty-minute walk once a week—is enough to provide some pro-tection not only from cardiovascular disease and cancer, but alsofrom stress, anxiety, and depression. Needless to say, fit people feelmore able, and that translates into improved self-efficacy.

# Unit Summary
I. With “normal” aging the size of the heart and its abili-
ty to pump blood effectively decrease. However, exer-
cise increases the development of collateral vesselswhich can help lessen the risk of heart attack andincrease the likelihood of survival when a heart attackdoes occur. Exercise also reduces the risk of stroke andimproves the body’s ability to use oxygen efficiently.
II. Age and inactivity affect the elasticity of the lungs;
however, older adults who exercise may see such ben-efits in cardio-respiratory fitness as a decrease inminute ventilation, an increase in vital capacity, and adecrease in respiratory exchange ratio.
III. The gradual but continual decrease in bone mass that
can occur with age results in structural weakening andraises the risk of spontaneous fractures. Regular activi-ty and especially weight bearing exercise can reducethis risk and even return bone density to pre-exerciselevels.
IV. A loss of muscle and strength is often seen in older
people; however, strength training can prevent thisloss and help in regaining muscle mass that may havealready been lost. Many experts regard strength train-ing as the single most important step one can take toretard the aging process. Maintaining muscle massallows individuals to manage body composition andhelps with posture, mobility, and flexibility as well.
V. The brain changes with age, often decreasing in
weight and losing interconnections among neurons.Exercise helps maintain the integrity of the centralnervous system and psychomotor control due toincreases in cerebral blood flow and elevated cerebralmetabolism. Further, exercise has been shown to havea positive effect on mental health by decreasing anxi-ety and levels of depression and improving motivationand self-esteem.68Senior Fitness

I. Exercise Facts and Myths
II. Questions Commonly Asked by
Older Adult Students
After completing this unit you will be able to:
• Identify many of the facts and myths surrounding
exercise and provide your clients with accurate infor-
mation to help them with achieve their fitness goals
• Know many of the questions commonly asked by
older adult clients and have clear answers to thesequestions
This unit identifies many of the facts and myths about fitness, and
answers those questions that are most frequently asked by olderadults, and often younger ones, about exercising.
Myth 1: By exercising only a few minutes every day you
can become fit.
Fact: There are no easy ways to fitness. The only way to become
physically “fit” is to exercise regularly. A total fitness program
involves the development of muscular strength and endurance,flexibility, balance, coordination, and cardiovascular endurance. Itis widely known that an individual must exercise regularly to main-tain and/or increase his or her fitness level.
Though less frequent and less intense programs have been shown to
improve different areas of fitness, an ideal program consists of thir-
ty to sixty minutes of aerobic exercise at target heart rate (THR)every other day coupled with strengthening exercises on alternate
days. This schedule would give the individual a six-day exercise reg-
imen during the week.
The aerobic portion of the workout should consist of activities that
use large muscle groups (i.e., legs), are continuous, and last a mini-mum of thirty minutes. However, recent research suggests that threeten-minute periods of exercise a day is equal to one thirty-minuteperiod of exercise. Examples of ae robic activities include brisk walk-
ing, bicycling, swimming, and cross-country skiing. Strength train-ing may include the use of free weights, machines, bands, or anyother device which is safe and provides adequate resistance.
Myth 2: Creams, pills, massages, herbal wraps, vibrating
belts, roller machines, and electrical exercise machines will melt fat.
Fact: Unfortunately, there is no magic pill, cream, or passive equip-
ment which is able to melt or metabolize fat. T o lose weight perma-
nently, you must make a lifestyle change that includes moderatephysical activity and sensible eating habits. Save your money.Exercise regularly, and eat properly.72Senior Fitness
Sample Aerobic Workout
Activity Time
Warm up and stretching 5 to 10 minutes
Aerobic activity 30 minutes
Cool down and stretching 5 to 10 minutes
Total 40 to 50 minutes
Myth 3: Doing twenty-five sit-ups and fifty side bends every
day will reduce the size of your stomach.
Fact: This is probably the greatest misconception in fitness. The
body does not have the ability to spot reduce or selectively choose
spots where fat can be lost. When you lose fat, you lose it from allover the body and not from one particular spot. There are only fourways to lose body fat:
1. Exercise aerobically at least three times each week
(aim to burn 3000 calories per week)
2. Limit the amount of food you eat
3. Surgically remove the fat4. Employ a combination of (1) and (2)
The best way to lose fat is to eat properly and exercise regularly, lim-
iting the weight loss to no more than two pounds per week to pre-vent the loss of lean body mass. Our bodies are composed of fat and
Facts and Myths of Fitness
# Unit 6 73

lean body mass. By losing too much weight too quickly, you are at
risk of losing more than just fat. T otal body weight is not important.Rather it’s what that weight is composed of that matters. For exam-ple, a one-hundred-pound fashion model may appear to be “thin”but may actually be considered obese (having excessive body fat);whereas a professional football player may weigh three hundredpounds and be considered lean (having very little body fat).
Myth 4: One only needs to warm
up before exercising on cold days.
Fact: Warming up is an essential part of every exercise session and
should always be included, not just on cold days. The purpose of the
warm-up is to prepare the body for exercise. This is accomplishedby beginning your exercise session at a very low level of intensityand gradually increasing it into a more vigorous workout. By slow-ly increasing your activity, you are allowing the blood to flow intothe muscles and raise muscular temperature. As the temperatureincreases, the muscle and connective tissue become more pliableand less susceptible to injury.
Cooling down after exercise is as valuable as warming up properly.
Stretching and slow walking allow the body to recover from exerciseand maintain suppleness. Train like an expensive racehorse: warmup before and cool down after your activity! It is also best to stretchat the end of each workout.
Myth 5: When you stop exercising, your
muscles turn into fat.
Fact: Muscle and fat are two completely different tissue types which
are not interchangeable. Everyone has a certain amount of fat and
muscle cells located throughout their bodies, which are establishedby adolescence. The size of these cells, not the number of cells,changes with diet and exercise. As we begin an exercise activity, ourmuscles become stronger and perhaps larger. Augment this withdieting, and you begin to lose body fat. As the percentage of body74Senior Fitness
fat is decreased, the size of the fat cells decreases which gives us the
appearance of being more muscular and toned.
When you stop exercising, the size of your muscle cells begin to
decrease, and if you continue eating the way you did while you wereactive, those excessive calories will be converted into fat. Therefore,when you stop exercising the muscle cells become smaller and thefat cells become larger, giving the impression that muscle is turninginto fat.
Myth 6: Taking vitamins alone will improve your
fitness and performance.
Fact: Not so! As long as humans have been competing in athletics,
they have been seeking the magic formula that would make them
run faster, throw further, and endure longer. There is still no scien-tific evidence to suggest that vitamins, enzymes, or any ergogenicaid in the absence of a proper diet and training program willenhance an athlete’s performance.
T o function properly, the body requires more than fifty different
nutrients daily. These are classified into six separate categories: (1)water, (2) carbohydrates, (3) protein, (4) lipids, commonly known
Facts and Myths of Fitness
# Unit 6 75

until the fat is usedas fuel.

as fats, (5) minerals, and (6) vitamins. When you eat a well-bal-
anced diet that incorporates each of the four basic food groups anddrink plenty of water, you will only require vitamin or mineral sup-plements in special circumstances (such as illness).
Myth 7: The “no pain, no gain” adage is a standard
everyone should follow when exercising.
Fact: For the highly trained athlete this may be an appropriate
maxim, but for the average individual it is not. Pain should be con-
sidered the body’s built-in warning system letting you know some-thing may be wrong. If you experience any pain, discontinue theexercise; however, learn to distinguish between pain and discom-fort. A better adage is “no mild discomfort, no gain.”
Y ou should only exercise to a point which you can tolerate com-
fortably. Exercise should not and does not have to be painful. Beaware of your capabilities and exercise within your limitations. Ifyou exercise too strenuously, you may be setting yourself up forinjury. If your fitness goal is to maintain or increase health, it isunnecessary to push your body to its limits. For example, if you jog,select a pace at which you can carry on a conversation. Exerciseshould become a joyful lifetime commitment not an act of dailydrudgery. If possible, exercise with a partner and make it part ofyour daily routine—walk at lunchtime, take the stairs instead of theelevator, or park your car several blocks from your workplace andwalk. Exercise should be fun!
Myth 8: Lifting weights will cause women to develop
large muscles.
Fact: Unless a woman spends a great deal of time working out in the
gym, like bodybuilders do, she does not need to worry about devel-
oping large muscles. Women simply do not possess the same levelof testosterone (the hormone partly responsible for muscularhypertrophy) as men; thus it is difficult for most women to increasetheir muscle size significantly.76Senior Fitness
Valsalva response: If the
glottis (the narrowest part
of the larynx is closed fol-lowing full inspiration andthe expiratory muscles arefully activated, the com-pressive forces of exhalationcan increase the intratho-racic pressure from 2 or 3mm Hg to upwards of 100mm Hg above atmosphericpressure. This forced exha-lation against a closed glot-tis is called the Valsalvamaneuver (named after theItalian anatomist who firstexplained the phenome-non) The intrathoracic pres-sure causes the veins tocompress and this in turnresults in significantlyreduced venous blood flowinto the heart and into thebrain. Dizziness, “spots”before the eyes and black-out can ensue. This is onegood reason why thosewith cardiac problemsshould refrain from all-outstraining (as in isometriccontraction), and insteadshould engage in a morerhythmic type of weightlift-ing technique while breath-ing normally.QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED BY THEOLDER ADULT STUDENT
1. How should I breathe during exercise?
Avoid holding your breath because it can elevateyour blood pressure and induce a V alsalva
response. The most important thing is to breathecomfortably. Don’t concentrate on any particular“way” to breathe. Breathing is an automaticresponse. If you find yourself holding your breath,count out loud or talk to your partner while doingthe exercise. Remember to breathe freely andeffortlessly. Some trainers suggest you exhale witheffort and inhale with the eccentric phase (relax-ation) when lifting weights.
2. Are vitamin and mineral supplements necessary?
When eating a well-balanced diet and drinkingplenty of fluids, there are only certain circum-stances, such as illness, which require the need forvitamin or mineral supplements.
3. How can I eliminate cellulite?
Cellulite does not exist. It is a term “invented” by aFrench beautician. What we understand to be cel-lulite is nothing more than subcutaneous fat, andas previously mentioned, the only way to elimi-nate fat is to exercise regularly and eat properly.Cellulite looks like cottage cheese because of theway the connective tissue holds in the fat.
4. Why do some people gain weight when they
start exercising?
Muscle is heavier than fat! As you become involved
in an exercise program and eat properly, your body
Facts and Myths of Fitness
# Unit 6 77
becomes leaner and begins to consist of less body
fat. It’s important to understand that it’s not howmuch you weigh but what that weight consists ofthat matters. Be careful of Body Mass Index for-mulas because highly muscled people will be classi-fied as fat according to these standards.
5. What is the best time of the day to exercise?
Y ou are the best judge of when you should exer-cise. Early morning workouts can be dangerousbecause blood platelets are stickier and could trig-ger heart attacks. In general, though, listen to yourbody to determine what time of the day is best foryou. Just remember that it is important to usecommon sense. If you have arthritis, exercise whenyou have the least amount of stiffness and pain.On very hot or humid days, it’s best not to exerciseat noon or in the early afternoon. If you are exer-cising outdoors, consider your route, lighting, and78Senior Fitness

you are more apt to stay with your program.
6. What should I wear when I exercise?
Y ou should wear clothing that is comfortable and
allows you the freedom to move easily and doesn’tinterfere with breathing or normal blood flow.Naturally, depending upon the activity, your attirewill vary.
Avoid rubberized outfits that restrict the body from
cooling properly. Comfortable shoes, which are wellfitting and appropriate for your activity, are a must.In addition, shoes should provide the proper trac-tion, as well as support, to prevent injuries.
7. How do I get rid of muscle cramps?
Muscle cramps can be brought on by inadequateblood flow, lack of essential electrolytes, or generalmuscle fatigue. T o help eliminate cramps, youshould first stretch the muscles which areinvolved. For example, cramps of the calf are com-mon. Eliminate these by gently pointing your toesback toward you and holding this position. Next,to increase blood flow to the area, try rubbing themuscle. This usually is helpful. Back off a little onyour workout intensity.
8. What causes muscle soreness (commonly
called “delayed onset muscle soreness”)?
Muscle soreness may be expected after beginning
an exercise program following a long period ofinactivity. During exercise the muscle and connec-tive tissue may be minutely torn causing spasmand fluid retention. This spasm can irritate nerveendings, thus causing pain. T o help prevent sore-

# Unit 6 79
ness: warm-up and stretch properly, progress
slowly in your exercise program, and cool-downeach time you exercise. If muscle soreness shouldoccur, mild stretching and a low-intensity activitysuch as walking can help relieve discomfort.
9. Is it okay to drink water during exercise?
T o carry out its normal physiological processes thebody needs water among many other things. T oexercise safely you should consume water before,during, and after exercise. This ensures that thewater you have lost through sweat is replenished.This is especially important on warm and humiddays. Urine should be clear at least once per day.Generally, the darker the urine, the more waterintake is needed.
10. What should I do if I experience increased
pain after exercise?
Remember the two-hour rule: two hours after
exercise, you should not experience a significantincrease in pain. If you do, back off. If the pain isin the joints, re-evaluate your routine.80Senior Fitness

to be Aware of with
Older Adult Clients
a. Movements to avoid
This section contains information on exercises and techniques that
may hurt or strain muscles, joints, or ligaments and are now con-sidered contraindicated for many adults. Where appropriate, alter-
native exercises or techniques have been provided.
It is important to remember that any exercise can become con-
traindicated if it is performed improperly or prescribed for thewrong reason. When selecting exercises for an individual, ask thefollowing questions:
1. What is the purpose of the exercise?
2. Is the exercise necessary for achieving this partici-
pant’s program goals?
3. Can the exercise be performed safely by this partic-
ipant without violating principles of good biome-
chanics? If not, what is an alternative exercise?contraindication: Any
circumstance or conditionthat makes a therapy, pro-cedure, or exercise inadvis-able.
hyperextension:
Extension of a limb or partbeyond the normal limit.
impingement: An
encroachment on the space
occupied by soft tissue,such as nerve or muscle. Inthis context, impingementrefers to nerve irritation(e.g., from pressure or fric-tion) associated with mus-cles.
supination: Assuming a
horizontal position facing
upward. In the case of thehand, it also means turningthe palm to face forward.The opposite of pronation(supine).CONTROVERSIAL EXERCISES
Certain exercises have been around so long that it is considered
irreverent to question their value. Good sense indicates that anyexercise can be considered detrimental if done incorrectly. Theimportant question you must ask when evaluating an exercise is“What is the benefit-to-risk ratio?” Can exercise cause more harmthan good? Is there a safer, more effective way to exercise that bodypart without potentially harming another body part?
High-risk areas include the knees, shoulders, neck, low back, hips
and ankles. Special attention should be paid when implementingexercises that involve those areas.
# Knees
The action of the knee is to flex and extend. Movements that hyper-extend or rotate the tibia should be eliminated. It is a good idea to
keep “soft knees” when exercising. Also,you should avoid twisting the body withthe feet planted. Do not include any exer-cises that do not keep the knees over thefeet. The knees and toes should alwayspoint in the same direction. Always avoidoverflexion of the knee joint.
# Shoulders
Shoulder impingement is increasingly
becoming a concern for exercisers. Cautionshould be used when bringing the armsabove the head. Movements need to becontrolled and the hands should besupinated when raising the arms above
shoulder height. Shoulders should berelaxed when performing arm movements.84Senior Fitness

flexion: A movement
which moves the two ends
of a jointed body part clos-er to each other, as inbending the arm. The actof flexing or bending.
pronation: Assuming a
facedown position. Of the
hand, turning the palmbackward or downward. Ofthe foot, lowering the inner(medial) side of the foot soas to flatten the arch. Theopposite of supination.
gait: Pattern of walking or
locomotion.NECK
Neck problems can occur when activities
cause excessive hyperextension and rota-tion. Neck movements should never bedone quickly or in an unsafe fashion.
# Low Back
The majority of adults will experienceback pain at some time in their life. Thisis a result of the culmination of misuseand abuse. It is critical that the back beprotected when exercising and the lowback be stabilized. Any exercise that cre-ates hyperextension of the low backshould be eliminated. Caution should be
used when doing movements that cause lateral flexion of the spine
and obliques forward rotation of the upper body.
# Ankles And Feet
It is important to pay attention to the position that your client’s feetare in when they land and when moving to avoid supination andpronation . Check your client’s gait to make sure that a preexisting
problem will not inhibit proper form.
Exercises Older Adults Should Avoid
# Unit 7 85

# Exercises To Eliminate
1. Head circles or head-rolling exercises
Rationale: Head circles may strain the supporting ligaments
which maintain stability in the cervical spine (neck area). This
exercise also causes excessive compression of the intervertebraldisk and impingement of the vertebra. Because of the degen-erative changes that occur with aging (i.e., osteoporosis), theolder individual is moresusceptible to injuryand so should avoid this exercise.
Alternative: Slowly turn
the head from left to
right, or lean the headfrom side to side.Maintain proper align-ment of head, neck, and shoulders.
2. Standing toe touches
Rationale: This exercise can hyperextend the joint capsule
and stretch the ligaments of the knee. In addition, it causes
excessive pressure of the interverte-bral disk in the lower back, whichmay strain the soft tissue structures.Rounding of the upper back is discouraged.
Alternative: While sitting on the
floor or in a chair, extend one or
both legs out in front of the body,keeping the back straight and theknees slightly bent. Slowly bend for-ward and reach toward the toes.86Senior Fitness
Head Circles
Standing Toe Touches
ballistic movement: An
exercise or sports-related
movement in which part ofthe body is “thrown” orbounced against the resist-ance of antagonist musclesor against the limits of ajoint. The latter, especially,is considered dangerous tothe integrity of ligamentsand tendons. High-impact,rapid, jerking movements.3. Bouncing during warm-up
or stretching exercises
Rationale: Bouncing or stretching ballistically does not
increase flexibility; rather it causes the stretched muscle tocontract and shorten which may induce strain or tear themuscle fibers.
Alternative: Slowly stretch to a point of mild discomfort, and
hold this position for 10 to 30 seconds.
4. Sit-ups with straight legs and
hands behind the head
Rationale: Doing straight-leg sit-ups does not work the
abdominal muscles but rather the hip flexor muscles. This
technique encourages a hyper-extended posture of the lowback ( lordosis ) and causes unnecessary strain to this area.
Holding the hands behind the head may contribute to a for-ward head position and kyphosis, as well as cause excessivepressure on the cervical area. In addition, having one’s feetheld during a sit-up is similar to doing straight leg sit-ups; itis not the abdominal muscles that are the prime movers butthe hip flexors. Many experts also recommend not usingabdominal or back extension machines in gyms.
Alternative: Lie flat on the floor, bend both knees, and bring
the heels as close as possible to the buttocks. Cross the arms
across the chest, slowly tuck the chin to the chest, and lift theshoulders off the floor. It is not necessary to pull farther thanhalfway up toward the knees.
5. Full squats or deep knee bends
Rationale: This kind of exercise creates excessive stretching of
the ligaments of the knee and may pinch the joint cartilage.Once the ligaments of the knee have been stretched, theycause instability of the knee joint.
Alternative: When squatting, do not go beyond the point at
which the thighs are parallel to the floor.
Exercises Older Adults Should Avoid
# Unit 7 87
lordosis: The forward
curving of the spine at the
neck (cervical spine) andlower back (lumbar spine).Often used to refer to anabnormally increased cur-vature of the lumbar spine.
6. Double leg lifts
Rationale: Like straight
leg sit-ups, double leg
lifts do not work the
abdominal area. Theyencourage a hyper-extended posture andcreate excessive pressurein the lumbar area.
Alternative: T o increase abdominal strength, perform sit-ups
or curl-ups with both knees bent, feet flat on the floor, arms
across the chest, and the heels as close to the body as possible.
7. Hurdler’s stretch
Rationale: By placing the leg in this bent position, excessive
stretching occurs to the ligaments of the knee which can causeunnecessary damage.
Alternative: Place the legs in front of the body and stretch
forward at the waist while keeping the back straight; or bend
one leg and place the bottom of the foot on the inside of thethigh and reach toward the toes. Y ou can also use the seatedstretches described in exercise two.
8. Trunk twist
Rationale: Twisting strains the lumbar
area and possibly the knee. T orquegenerated by the twisting action in achair causes considerable strain to thelower back.
Alternative: Lean left and right in a
sitting position.88Senior Fitness
Trunk Twist
Double Leg Lifts
9. Isometric exercises
Rationale: This type of exercise is contraindicated for
individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease,
especially high blood pressure. Isometric arm exercisesincrease blood pressure.
Alternative: T o minimize the risk of unnecessary high blood
pressure, exercise with a comfortable weight, breathe properly,
and perform the exercise through the entire motion allowableby the joint.
10. Hyper-extending or arching of back
Rationale: This compresses the disks of the lower back and
encourages the posture of lordosis (sway back).
Exercises Older Adults Should Avoid
# Unit 7 89
Prone Trunk Raise
Alternative: T o help strengthen the lower back extensors, sit
in a chair, bend forward, and have someone resist slightly on
your upper back when returning to an upright position.
Use caution when doing hypertension exercises, they may not
be appropriate for some people with low back problems.Always consult a physician or physical therapist before doingextension exercises.
11. Immediate rest after intense exercise
Rationale: Resting immediately after exercising prevents ade-
quate return of blood back to the heart.
Alternative: Continue with low level exercise, such as walking,
to encourage proper return of blood to the heart and thereby
preventing any “pooling” effect which may occur in the lowerextremities.
12. Holding the breath during exercise
Rationale: This decreases the return of blood to the heart
which can result in dizziness or fainting.
Alternative: Breathe naturally; do not force inhalation or
exhalation.
# Special Precautions To Be Aware
# Of With Older Adult Clients
# Movements To Avoid
1. Hopping, jumping, jarring/twisting
This stresses the ankle, knee, hip and back and may cause fur-ther damage to bones in inner ear if structure is already weak-ened. Hopping increases impact stress threefold and maycause shin splints (pain in the lower front of leg). These exer-cises are not recommended for people with arthritis, osteo-porosis, or balance problems.
Alternative: Low impact exercises that keep one foot on the
floor at all times.
2. Bringing the knee to the chest more than 90
degrees and turning the leg inward
Following total hip replacement, or in case of shallow hip
socket, this can result in dislocation of hip.
Alternative: Standing or seated exercises that emphasize the
strengthening of the muscles of the lower body in order to
improve hip movement.90Senior Fitness
varicose veins: Twisted,
widened veins caused by
swollen or enlarged bloodvessels. The blood vesselshave enlarged due a weak-ening in the vein’s wall orvalves.3. Long periods of standing, especially with
little movement
This increases varicose veins.
Alternative: Keep moving slightly and do not stand for long
periods of time.
4. Locked joints or snapping limbs straight
These movements strain ligaments and cartilage by going
beyond the normal limits of the joint and are especially badfor people with arthritis.
Alternative: Straighten legs and arms slowly and smoothly.
5. Side and front lunges
This can result in a strained knee joint.Alternative: Keep the knee centered over the foot at 90-degree
angle while lunging to the side or front.

Make sure the lead leg’s
knee does not protrudepast the toes.
6. Loud music
This can result in sensorineural hearing loss . Aerobic classes
have been found to have music at 110 decibels and above. Thesafe maximum range is 80 decibels. Damage to the hammerand stirrup in the inner ear has been linked to excessive jar-ring/bouncing, especially when compounded with loud music.
Alternative: Play music at lower volume. Do not place speak-
ers near students or the instructor.sensorineural hearing
loss: A type of hearing loss
in which the root cause liesin the vestibulocochlearnerve (Cranial nerve VIII),the inner ear, or centralprocessing centers of thebrain.
7. Straight arm circles and side arm
raises with palm down
This can result in excessive wear and tear on the shoulder
joint.
Alternative: Keep palm up whenever arm is raised/circled
above shoulder height.
8. Standing hamstring stretch
This may overstretch hamstrings, which can irritate the sciatic
nerve . Additionally, students with poor balance may fall while
performing this activity.Alternative: Seated hamstring and calf stretch.92Senior Fitness
sciatic nerve: The nerve
running along the buttocks,
posterior thigh and leg,originating primarily fromthe L5 and S1 nerve roots.

# How To Teach Older Adults
Numerous principles affect an individual’s rate and amount of
learning. The teacher of adults must understand these principles ifhe or she wishes to be successful and effective. Following are a fewthings that almost always hold true and that the wise trainer woulddo well to keep in mind.
Law of Effect
People tend to accept and repeat those actions that are pleasant andsatisfying and avoid those which are not. In other words—nothingsucceeds like success, so make every effort to see that your clientsachieve some level of success during each class.
Law of Primacy (The Impact of First Impressions)
First impressions are lasting. Make initial client meetings safe,meaningful, and clearly structured.
Law of Disuse
A skill not practiced or knowledgenot used will be forgotten quickly.Important skills and conceptsneed to be reviewed in order to beretained. Adults want to be able touse the knowledge and skills theyhave learned soon after the origi-nal teaching/learning experience.They are not willing to wait foryears to see the results.
Law of Vigor
A dramatic or exciting learning experience is more likely to beremembered than a routine or boring experience. Let your teachingcome alive. Use vivid examples, and participate with the partici-pants. Remember that humor is a useful teaching tool. If studentsare laughing, then you know they are listening. 96Senior Fitness

# Accommodating
# Learning-Style Preferences
Each individual has a preferential learning style involving a domi-
nant sensory channel. T o foster the learning experience, the instruc-tor needs to know the learning style of each participant.
The importance of trainers’ interactions with clients cannot be
overemphasized. The primary function of a trainer is to hasten theparticipant’s cognitive, psychomotor, and affective development asthey relate to physical education. Trainers should be aware of thetypes of interactions that foster each client’s learning, motivation toexercise, and attendance at exercise sessions. The following sectiondescribes instructional strategies in the visual, auditory, and kines-thetic/tactile domains (adapted from McKenzie, 1984). If a partici-pant has a weak sensory channel—visual, auditory, or kinesthetic/tactile—then a multi-sensory approach is warranted. Thisapproach makes use of all of the senses to promote and reinforcethe learning of knowledge or skills.
VISUAL DOMAIN:
# The Client Learns Best By Watching
If a client learns best by watching, try these methods:
1. Demonstrate a skill whenever possible.
2. Tell the client what to look for in your
demonstrations.
3. When multiple individuals are present, be sure
everyone in the group can see you.
4. Maintain eye contact when speaking to the client.5. Use diagrams and videos.6. Use visual cues to enhance body awareness and
coordinated movement (e.g., footprints placed on
the floor, stickers placed on the body or equip-ment, pointing to a body part, arrows or lines onthe floor).
Effective Teaching
# Unit 8 97
AUDITORY DOMAIN:
# The Client Learns Best By Hearing
If a client learns best by listening, try these methods:
1. Whenever possible, provide the client with facts
or background information regarding exercises or procedures.
2. Verbally direct the individual to perform a task.
3. Allow individuals with hearing impairments to see
your mouth and hand gestures. Do not over exag-
gerate mouth movements.
4. Provide corrective skill feedback—that is, informa-
tion regarding how to correct an inadequate per-formance. Information about results leads toincreased learning.
5. Provide positive skill feedback—that is, tell the
client what they did correctly to reinforce the likeli-hood of the skill’s being correctly performed again.
6. Ask questions regarding discomfort during exercis-
es (e.g., pain during passive range-of-motion, painduring cardiovascular training). This informationalerts the trainer to signs of exercise distress andprovides feedback regarding his or her technique.The trainer should also ask questions regardingexercises or procedures for the purpose of testingthe participant’s knowledge.
7. Listen to the client’s questions, responses, or
attempts at conversation.
8. Utilize praise, vocal intonation, claps, gestures, and
expressions to activate or intensify motor perform-ances or foster appropriate behavior.
9. Use simple verbal cues to assist the individual in
better visualizing the movement.
10. Remember that a person cannot talk and listen at
the same time. A good teacher listens with bothears and eyes.98Senior Fitness
KINESTHETIC/TACTILE DOMAIN:
# The Client Learns Best By Doing
If a client learns best by the hands-on approach, try these methods.
Remember, though, always ask permission before touching a clientas part of instruction.
1. Manually guide a participant with apraxia (visual
impairment) through the desired motions.
2. Physically assist a participant whenever needed
(e.g., manual assistance should enable a participant
to reach full range of motion).
3. Tap the body part to facilitate movement in the
correct direction.
T o be a more effective trainer, utilize this information while teach-
ing your older client new skills. Y our attention to detail will berewarded in the form of attentive clients and a reputation for gen-uine care regarding the progress of your older clientele.

# Unit 8 99

# Behaviors Of Effective Teachers
An effective teacher holds and projects high expectations for his or
her students’ success. If you believe that your clients can makeprogress and improve their quality of life, then they will come toshare those beliefs. Maximize opportunities for participants toengage in learning experiences. Learning experiences help solidifywhat you have taught them during your training; such experiencesmake plain information come to life and seem relevant.
Manage time and organize sessions
efficiently. Do your research andhomework on your own time. Meetyour client with answers to ques-tions raised during the last session.Pace the information you choose toshare in order to maximize partici-pant success. Set realistic goalsabout how long it will take you towork with a client. Work towardmastery of knowledge and skills bysystematically monitoring clientprogress and providing feedback.Be well prepared—know the sub-ject, know the participant, and know the appropriate teaching style.Engage in active teaching with all participants whether individualsor groups of varying size. Maintain a high level of energy for eachclient regardless of how many times you may have presented thesame information that day. Clients are sensitive to differences in theenergy levels of their instructors.
Provide a supportive learning environment characterized by warmth
and personal support. Select equipment and activities that are appro-priate for each client’s development level. Remember that yourclient’s self-esteem is more important than any exercise or activity.Think of what clients can do, rather than what they cannot do. 100Senior Fitness

# Professional Conduct
As a trainer, it is imperative that you always conduct yourself in a
professional manner. Observing the following general rules ofbehavior will help you do this.
1. Be punctual.
2. Use appropriate language and terminology, and
be prepared to answer client questions.
3. Refrain from unnecessary chatting with fellow
trainers.
4. Give your full attention to your client.5. Wear appropriate clothing.6. Attune yourself to the older client’s interests and
motivating factors. (These can differ greatly from
younger generations.)
7. Maintain client confidentiality at all times.
8. If you must touch a person, ask permission, and
keep it appropriate.
We have covered a number of different aspects of effective teaching.
The following list summarizes some of these things—key elementsin helping you enhance the education and motivation of your olderadult clients.
1. Give each participant a clear exercise objective for
each training session.
2. Provide concise exercise instructions and precise
exercise demonstrations.
3. Attentively supervise clients as they train.
4. Appropriately assist participants when necessary,
especially when trying new exercises.
Effective Teaching
# Unit 8 101
5. Focus on one task at a time.
6. Progress gradually from simple to more complex
exercise concepts and requirements.
7. Be generous with positive reinforcement, and
let individuals know their exercise efforts are
appreciated.
8. Provide specific feedback on exercise performance
to facilitate the learning process and correct errors.
9. Promote relevant communication by carefully and
frequently asking questions.
10. Welcome participants to the exercise session,
and thank them for successfully completing their workout.
11. To get maximum results from your students try the
sandwich approach: put a little positive reinforce-ment on the bottom, add corrective feedback inthe middle, and finish with a layer of positiveencouragement on the top.102Senior Fitness

# Getting The Older Adult Started
Sensible and regular exercise is an investment for life. Rehabilitation
specialists have a term called “functional fitness.” They want us tokeep our legs and body fit so we can function as fully as possible foras long as possible.
Recently in Healthy People 2010, the United States Department of
Health and Human Services suggested the leading factor contribut-ing to premature disability and death is the sedentary life stylemany Americans live. Some older adults use injury, impairment, ordisability as a reason not to exercise.
One key to avoiding this situation is to take extra care to avoid
injury at the outset. Many people use outdated training techniquesor ill-fitted equipment, or they push themselves beyond reasonablelimits. These things can contribute to exercise-induced injuries andthen to stopping exercising altogether. Don’t let your clients becomepart of the dropout statistics. Encourage them to choose a sport oractivity that fits their body type and interests. If it requires specialequipment for safety or to play, they should make sure the equip-ment works and fits properly. Also explain the concept of crosstraining by mixing up activities. Whatever activity individualschoose, they should have fun doing it. If they can go outside, sug-gest that they try walking or resistance training outdoors.
Many individuals suffer from some type of impairment. How they
deal with that impairment will determine whether or not itbecomes a disability. An impairment is a pathological disorder suchas arthritis. If the impairment isn’t addressed, it can lead to a func-tional limitation that causes a dysfunction, such as not being able towalk. If the impairment continues to cause the limitation, theimpairment can become a full-blown handicap.
One common problem affecting older individuals is some sort of
limiting back disability. Specialists are now recommending trainingthe core muscles of the body—the trunk—to help with this. As the
Effective Teaching
# Unit 8 103
core muscles get stronger, they can
protect the spine from stressfulmovements. The primary core mus-cles that need to be strengthened toprotect the spine are: the abdomi-nals, the obliques, the spinal exten-sors, and the trapezius. Other keymuscles that play a significant rolein controlling the pelvic region are
the gluteus maximus, hamstrings, quadriceps, hip flexors, and hipabductors. T o stay pain free, it’s important to work the core musclestogether to develop a well-balanced spine.
Some older clients will be very fit and not need rehabilitation. With
other individuals, though, medical care will be needed. In thesecases a combination of therapy and fitness is now being suggested.Advise your clients not to quit exercising because of an injury. First,they should get a diagnosis and evaluate what caused the injury.Some muscles may be too weak, or some may be too inflexible. Incases such as these, an appropriately geared exercise regimen wouldbe the key to healing as well as to achieving a condition of overallfitness tailored to prevent such injuries in the future.
All of us, but especially older adults, must work to strengthen our
bodies. By strengthening the muscles around the joints, we stabilizeand protect them. Stretching helps, too. Exercise often results inshortened muscles, a condition which makes us prone to muscularstrain injuries. The more time we train, the more time we shouldspend stretching.
Some clients may respond positively to programs consisting of
short, intermittent exercise. Y ou can inform folks in this group thatthree bouts of ten minutes each is equal to thirty minutes of nonstopexercise. For some older adults, knowing this type of work-out is anoption might make the difference between getting and staying fitand the all-too-rapid physical decline that accompanies inactivity.104Senior Fitness

Following are some points you can review with your older clients to
help them get into the frame-of-mind of wanting to maintain theirhealth and fitness for all aspects of life, athletic and otherwise.
1. Set reasonable goals.
2. Weigh yourself monthly. Most older adults suffer
from “creeping obesity”—five extra pounds here
that don’t go away, followed by another fivepounds there....
3. Make your healthy lifestyle enjoyable. Exercise and
eat healthy foods most of the time, but don’tworry if you have to miss a workout or choose tohave a piece of cake once in a while.
4. Reward yourself for small accomplishments.
5. Be prepared for a fitness opportunity. Keep exercise
clothes in the car. If your schedule changes, use the
extra time to exercise.
6. Don’t start doing too much too soon. If you have
been away from fitness for a while, start back atabout one third of what you were doing beforeyou stopped. Don’t increase by more than 10 per-cent per week.
7. Listen to your body, and heed what it says. Learn
the difference between mild discomfort and pain.
8. Warm-up, train, and cool-down.
# Designing A Workoutfor The Older Adult
Improving your health and fitness does not have to hurt. T oo many
people are afraid to start a fitness program for fear they will hurtthemselves. Others who are fit may develop an injury and start backtoo soon which can lead to the frustration of re-injury. Othersremember how fit they were in their twenties and thirties andbecome discouraged thinking they can’t ever regain that level of fit-
Effective Teaching
# Unit 8 105
ness. Whatever one’s mindset, the first few steps toward health and
fitness can be the most difficult as well as the most important.
A comprehensive workout should include a warm-up, a workout, a
cool-down, and stretching, in that order. Begin the warm-up withfive to ten minutes of light cardiovascular work and follow with fiveto ten minutes stretching the shoulder joints, back, groin, and legs.See the suggested exercises later in this course, and choose several toperform during the workout. Choose exercises to address the spe-cific body area you wish to tone and shape. Pick at least two exer-cises for each body part. Vary the workout so it does not becomeboring. Try playing music or watching an exercise program or videowhile working away the calories. Finally, for the cool-down, stretchand perform the same exercises as done when warming up.
Most people know there is no perfect exercise. A comprehensive
therapeutic exercise program should address balance, neuromus-cular coordination, flexibility, cardiovascular fitness, muscularstrength, and endurance. However, if a disability is involved, it isimportant to address those parameters involved in improving106Senior Fitness

functional fitness (getting out of a chair, putting groceries away,
etc.). If you can include exercises that will allow clients to betterperform activities of daily living, you have an exercise programthat can make a difference. Proper exercise can lead to an improvedquality of life.
# Fitness And Stress
Good stress occurs when you try to run a little faster or lift a little
more weight. Bad stress occurs when you have pressure to meet adeadline or have to deal with a difficult situation. Bad stress can alsobe called distress. Distress affects our mental and physical health.This kind of stress is the perception that an event or circumstancewill challenge or exceed a person’s ability to cope. This might helpexplain why some events, like deadlines, can cause some people towork harder and paralyze others.
Major stressors in life can affect health. Some stress-producing
events include marriage, divorce, and death. Although most peopleagree that major upheavals such as those listed above cause a greatdeal of distress, a study at the University of California at Berkeleyfound that everyday aggravations can actually take the greatest toll.Researchers found the cumulative effects of distress, such as thehassles of too many responsibilities, constant interruptions, toomuch noise, or even trying to learn a new computer program, canfar outweigh the stress of a major event. While stress motivatessome people to work harder, its cumulative effects have been asso-ciated with colds, stomachaches, headaches, high blood pressure,and heart disease.
Exercise and play can help relieve stress and relax you. Some fitness
experts maintain that one exercise session will generate about anhour-and-a-half of relaxation. Try breathing deeply between exer-cises to slow down momentarily. Don’t forget to laugh and play inaddition to exercising, and encourage your clients to do so as well.
Working out should be fun. Some of us are so compulsive we
become aggravated and experience stress if we miss our normal
Effective Teaching
# Unit 8 107
workout routine because of vacation, an appointment, a visitor, or
some other reason. Remember, though, that having fun with fitnessis key. Among other things, it will keep you committed. Speed-play,intervals, and cross training add diversity to training. Some peopleare content running the same course or doing the same weight andswim routine every day. Other people find they need variety to staymotivated and committed to exercise. Do whatever it takes to keepexercise enjoyable, and you will stick with it and reap its rewards.
Here are some suggestions for varying your routine.
If you’re walking outside and see a tree in the dis-
tance, pick up your pace until you reach it. Oncethere, use the tree for support and do two sets ofthirty-second heel-cord stretches. Take off foranother tree, and at that tree do squats against thetree, say two sets for thirty seconds. Take off againuntil you find a strong tree that will allow you tohang from a limb and pull yourself up—at least try!This is a fun way to incorporate stretching andstrengthening into your daily walk. Be creative.
If you’re on vacation and you’re a regular swim-mer, you may find those hotel pools are too crowd-ed for a good lap-swim workout. Try going into thedeep end and doing water-running, jumping jacks,or treading water. Follow that workout with push-ups and press-ups at the edge of the pool.
If you’re at a hotel with no exercise room or equipment, try stairwell walking. Make sure the stairs are well lit. Climb up, then take the elevator back down.
At home, at the office, or in a hotel, use a hallwayto do one-quarter lunges down the wall.
Do pushups against a sturdy, bolted park bench.
Remember: safety is key! Make sure unconventional equipment is
safe, and is strong enough and sturdy enough to support you.108Senior Fitness
# The Importance Of Balance
It is important to balance your workout mode. It is also important
to balance your muscle use and development. Many muscular-skeletal problems occur as the result of muscle imbalances. Watch amarathon or any type of running event. Evaluate the posture andphysique of the runners. Some may have well developed muscles intheir legs, but scrawny upper bodies. Check their posture. Manyhave round shoulders and a forward-leaning head. They are train-ing their legs and working out their heart, but their other musclesare out of shape.
Cross-training involves blending various fitness workouts to work
opposing muscle groups. A cross-training workout keeps the par-ticipant from getting bored with his or her workout. It allows dif-ferent muscles to be used to help a person better prepare forparticipating in unaccustomed activities without creating risk forinjury. By cross-training one can avoid overuse injuries.
Try to blend all of the major fitness ingredients into your routine. If
you are a swimmer, try to include weight-bearing activities. If you
Effective Teaching
# Unit 8 109

are a walker, try to combine strength training with your stretching
program to keep you in perfect balance. If you are a runner, stretchand stretch again. Spend time working opposing muscles fromthose that are working when you run.
Consider your physical balance, also. T otal fitness should include
stretching and strengthening, along with cardiovascular fitness andposture work. Mobility and agility training should address balanceskills along with fall-prevention activities.110Senior Fitness

VI. Thoughts for Consideration
As a health professional, you can affect behavioral changes that will
improve your clients’ lives. Strength training and cardiorespiratoryexercises are therapeutic modalities you bring to all your clients, butan older clientele may present different motivational challenges.
Using different approaches to behavior modification and under-
standing what motivates the older adult is crucial.
Optimal learning occurs when the teaching style matches the char-
acteristics of the learner. No single teaching style, strategy,approach, or method is a panacea for all instructional situations.Effective teachers learn to adapt their teaching styles to match theirstudents’ various learning styles.
When working with older clients, educators are faced with the chal-
lenge of facilitating learning for a group of individuals who may pos-sess various learning styles as well as age-related disabling conditions.Understanding the learning process in these situations is crucial andmeans the difference between mediocre and effective programs.
# Knowledge As A Motivator
Knowledge is an important factor in intrinsic and extrinsic motiva-tion, yet doctors often fail to give their older clients the same “pre-ventative” information they give to their younger patients. Surveysof primary care physicians and clinicians indicate that only thirty114Senior Fitness

percent provide counseling to their sedentary clients on the bene-
fits of physical activity. Information on how to reduce stress, lowercholesterol, control weight, and exercise is not wasted on an agingpopulation. As we have discussed in previous units, older adults arecapable of significantly improving their health. Older clients willlook to their health and fitness professional as a resource forimproving their knowledge.
Educating your older clients about health and fitness allows them to
understand and participate more completely in the training process.Knowledge can serve to build intrinsic motivation for exercising.Many exercisers have learned that staying on schedule and living ahealthy active lifestyle makes them feel good about themselves, andthat is a reward in itself. Feeling good about their healthy lifestyle,the way they look, and most importantly about the good care theyhave given themselves is something that will help your older clientsand continue to serve as intrinsic motivation for exercise.
Knowledge also can act as an extrinsic motivator. If the doctor tells
a patient his or her blood pressure has gone down since beginningregular exercise, that information serves as an extrinsic motivator tocontinue exercising. Positive reinforcement is a strong motivator,but negative reinforcement also motivates. If the doctor tells apatient that an inactive lifestyle has resulted in cardiovascular dis-ease or elevated cholesterol, that individual may feel compelled toexercise because of fear that the condition may worsen otherwise.
# A Different Era
Another important factor to recognize is that older adults have hadmany years, if not decades, to develop their bad habits; and it maytake some time to replace unhealthy habits with healthy ones. Someof your clients may have never been in a fitness center before begin-ning work with you, and many pieces of the equipment they willuse will be completely foreign to them. Most of your older clientsdid not have access to adequate physical education programs whenthey were younger; for example, some may have gained their only

physical training experience while serving in the Armed Forces.
Defining what motivates your clients and taking into considerationpast exposure to health and fitness is very important. Patience, tol-erance, and understanding are invaluable qualities for you as a fit-ness professional working with older adults.
Successful fitness professionals will be good at staying organized,
developing trust with their clientele, and listening. Being organizedinvolves responsibilities like keeping your client’s progress accurate-ly charted. Developing trust requires that you use safe techniquesthat do not cause injury, that you show up to all appointments ontime, ready to teach and train, and that you keep private informa-tion private. Listening to your clients provides you with sufficientinformation on how to appeal to them and increase their chances ofregular participation in exercise. Combining these qualities willenable you to move your clients closer to optimal health.
# Socialization
Many older adults enjoy working with other people their own age.Being around other older adults makes trying something new feelmore comfortable and safe. Encouraging social interaction is veryimportant and can be beneficial. The Surgeon General’s report onphysical activity and health states, “physical activity reduces symp-toms of anxiety and depression and fosters improvements in moodand feelings of well being.” Encourage your older clients to get toknow one another. It creates a support system for them. TheSurgeon General’s report also says “social support from family andfriends has been consistently and positively linked to regular phys-ical activity.” When people start feeling better from their new activeand healthy lifestyle, they may encourage their friends to seek youto set them up with a fitness program.
As mentioned earlier, motivation can be both intrinsic and extrin-
sic. This means the motivation for exercise can come from externalfactors such as compliments, loved ones’ urging, or trophies ofsome kind. Motivation can also come from internal factors: a desire116Senior Fitness
to be healthy, a desire to stay active, or a desire to become better at
a skill. Most people have a bit of both types of motivation that spurthem to achieve their goals.
# Goal Setting
Setting realistic goals is another important factor in motivation. Ifgoals are too lofty and can’t be met, it will be difficult to use goal-setting effectively in your motivation strategies. Using goals to stim-ulate progress in exercise programs is as effective with a seniorpopulation as it is with any other group. Goals come in differentforms, ranging from short-term to long-term, with each type serv-ing a different purpose. Short-term goals can be used to renew dailyresolve. Encourage your clients to choose an activity they wish toaccomplish each day. Attempting to walk five minutes longer on thetreadmill or eliminating a fatty food from the diet are examples ofshort-term goals. Achieving a goal is very motivating; by perform-ing the activity they set as their daily goal, individuals reinforce apositive behavioral trend. The healthy trend that develops is bene-ficial on the road to achieving long-term goals as well.
Motivating the Older Adult
# Unit 9 117

Long-term goals are often comprised of a number of short-term or
even mid-term goals. Usually six months to a year or more is con-sidered the time frame for a long-term goal. Within that time, yourclients may achieve many small victories on the road to accomplish-ing their long-term goals. Losing a significant amount of weight ordeveloping enough strength to trade in the walker for a cane areexamples of long-term goals. If a client is properly motivated andencouraged by setting and achieving goals, that client may make apermanent change that will improve his or her quality of life.
# Goal Orientation
Goal orientation is a key element in establishing strong motivation.Goal-orientation not only shows you where you are going, it alsoshows you how to get there. Beware, however, of allowing your goalsto impose limits on your clients’ performance by making them“final destinations.” Instead, look at your goals as “stepping-stones”that will put you in position to access your next stepping-stone! Inother words, the goal is not an end, but a means to another goal.Excellence is an ongoing process for the passionate, committedtrainer.
A goal can be seen as the bridge between wanting to achieve some-
thing and actually achieving it. The following conditions must bepresent in order for a sincere desire to be considered a goal.
• A goal must be well defined. Vague wishes or
desires, such as “I want to be a great baseball play-
er” or “I want to become thinner” just don’t cut it.Instead, “I want to make the little league team thisyear” or “I want to weigh 165” are better defined,and as such, are more attainable.
• A goal must be stated in writing. Busy schedules
and the various complexities of life have a way ofturning sincere desires into distant memories. Goalsmust be written down and put in a place wherethey will be seen often.
• A goal must be stated in the positive. The subcon-
scious mind does not understand negatively stated118Senior Fitness
goals, so always use a positive frame of reference in
constructing your goals. Not “I won’t eat junk foodany more” but “I will eat healthy foods each day.”Better yet, “I enjoy eating healthy foods each day.”Now the goal is an affirmation, which can be usedto precipitate action.
• A goal must have a deadline for its completion. In
order to get really excited about a goal, there mustbe an expected time of completion. Otherwise,there will be no sense of urgency, and before youknow it, you are right back where you started, nocloser to your goal. Of course, unexpected prob-lems and circumstances often arise, and when thishappens, simply adjust the completion dateaccordingly.
• A goal must have sincere emotional appeal. If it
does not, there will be no urgency or passion.Learn to prioritize the most important goals, andmake the distinction between a mere wish and animportant objective.
• A goal must be difficult, yet realistic. If the goal is
too easy, e.g., “I will go to the gym tomorrow,” itwill be very unlikely that enough attention will befocused on it to get it done. Conversely, if it is toodifficult, the confidence of knowing it can be donewill be lacking. Set goals in such a way that with asustained, concentrated effort, you know you canget the job done.
# Excuses Or Barriers To Exercise
Older people give many reasons for not engaging in exercise. Some
of the reasons discussed in the book, Biomarkers , include embar-
rassment, humiliation, self-deprecation, and self-doubt. Whateverthe reason, it is important to get to the root of it so that you cancounter with better reasons to give exercise a chance.
Embarrassment and humiliation can stem from entering into unfa-
miliar territory. Entering a gym at age seventy and not knowinghow to properly use any of the equipment makes some people feel
Motivating the Older Adult
# Unit 9 119
inadequate. Many clients share a feeling that they are in a “fish
bowl,” being watched by everyone in the facility. The awkward feel-ing of not knowing how to use the machines, coupled with thesense of being onstage, can be a strong deterrent. Remind yourclients that you will guide them through the training exercises andthat everyone else they see started at the beginning just as they arenow. Some clients may be embarrassed about being so “out ofshape.” Assure your clients that within a relatively short period oftime, they will not be breathing as heavily or feeling so run downafter only a few minutes of exercise. T ell your clients that regularparticipation will not only get them through their training sessionsmore easily, but also will help them get through their daily activitieswith greater ease. Nothing succeeds like success! Build some ele-ment of success into every workout for your client.
Some older adults may make self-deprecating remarks to the effect
that they feel silly beginning an exercise program at such anadvanced age. Use this opportunity to praise your older clients forhaving the courage and wisdom to start taking better care of them-selves through exercise. Help them realize that it would be counter-productive for them not to partake in activities that can improvetheir quality of life.
Y ou may also find that some older adults experience self-doubt
because the social group they associate with does not support theirinterest in exercise. Encourage these clients to make new friendswhere they participate in the fitness program. Their old friends willstill be there to socialize with when they are finished exercising.Many times the increase in energy and feelings of well-being exud-ed by your client will spark an interest among their old friends tojoin in. Soon your clients may find themselves exercising with oldfriends and new.
Whatever the motivator may be, communication with your older
clients will provide insight into what will most help them. If youtake the time to get to know your clients, you will prolong the120Senior Fitness

amount of time they spend training with you. And the more time
they spend training, the greater the results they will achieve!
# Thoughts For Consideration
• Exercise is a journey, not a destination! Enjoy
the journey!
• If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll
always get what you’ve always gotten.
• If not now, when?
• It is never too late to feel great.• Everything that gets worse with age is positively
influenced with exercise.
• Growing older is a privilege not granted to everyone.

# Unit Summary
I. Knowledge can serve as an important motivator for
exercise.
a. Many doctors fail to give their older clients the
same “preventative” information they provide to
their younger patients.
b. Older clients will often depend on their fitness pro-
fessional to improve their knowledge.
i. Knowledge builds intrinsic motivation for exer-
cising. Working out and living an active lifestylemakes people feel good about themselves, andthat in itself is a terrific motivator.
ii. Knowledge can also be an extrinsic motivator.
Knowing that your blood pressure has gonedown as a result of exercise provides significantmotivation for continuing to stay fit.
II. Older adults have had years or even decades to devel-
op bad habits. A successful trainer will find out whatthe client’s fitness history is and use that informationto help the individual move forward.
III. The socialization that comes with exercising can be a
terrific side benefit for many older adults.
a. Interaction with other exercisers provides support
and positive social contact.
b. The compliments and encouragement of family
and friends is rewarding.
IV. Goal setting stimulates progress and is as effective
with older clients as it is with others, and both short-
term and long-term goals have their place in motivat-ing individuals to stick with their fitness program.
V. Older people often give many reasons for not exercis-
ing. Trainers must be alert to these excuses and seekto understand what is motivating them. Getting tothe root of the concern opens an opportunity for thetrainer to understand the client’s fears and counterwith better reasons in favor of exercise.

# Basic Assessment
Every exercise program should begin with an assessment of your
client’s physical fitness; unfortunately this process is often neglect -
ed. Each physical assessment should at least include the parameters of muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and cardiovascular endurance. Assessments provide a baseline from which to evaluate your progress. Assessments allow you to note the areas that need improvement, and from that information, develop a personalized program based on what is best for your client. Assessments also give you an opportunity to discuss what the results mean with your
client. This is a great time to reiterate the importance of physical fit -
ness and how improvements in test scores reflect on improvements
in health.
Assessment is the first step in developing an exercise program,
but be aware that not all assessment tools are suitable for all cli -
ents. Assessment should be done during the course of your initial consultation. You should discuss in depth any medical or chronic conditions that your client presents. This is also the appropriate time to request medical clearance from the client’s physician and, if necessary, inquire about parameters to work within for more seri -
ous conditions. If it is impossible for you to speak directly with the physician regarding your client’s medical condition, send a form to the doctor to complete and send back to you, or have the client take it to the doctor and bring it back to you. You may create your own or use the example provided. The form should include the doctor’s recommendation for exercise, any activities or exercises that would be contraindicated (and the reason why), and any other pertinent information relevant to designing a safe and effective training pro -
gram. This form should be completed in addition to the medical clearance release form.
Once the client returns the form to you, be sure to go over it with
him/her thoroughly. This will ensure that you are very familiar 126Senior Fitness

with the medical/health history of the client and also give you a
chance to discuss options. Once certified, these forms are available to you for download at issatrainer.com.
Once you reach the decision to have your client start exercising, his/
her physician may recommend a graded exercise test (GXT) before you have him/her exercising. This procedure commonly referred to as an exercise stress test. Such a recommendation from one’s phy -
sician may raise a number of questions in your mind regarding a GXT: What does a GXT involve? Why should your client undergo a GXT? Is it safe? What information does it provide? Understanding the answers to such questions and other relevant issues concerning graded exercise testing may help to alleviate much of the confusion and mystery that frequently exists concerning this increasingly utilized evaluative procedure. Certainly if your client has never engaged in an aerobic exercise program before, a better under -
standing of what an exercise stress test involves may lessen the likelihood of your client experiencing undue anxiety.
# What A Gxt Involves
A GXT can be administered in a variety of locations, including a physician’s office, a hospital, and a health and fitness facility. Regardless of where a GXT is administered, special equipment to handle any medical emergency that may arise and a sufficient number of appropriately trained professionals must be present. According to the guidelines established by the American Heart Association (AHA) and adopted by ISSA, all individuals who administer GXTs should be trained in cardiopulmonary resusci -
tation (CPR), and at least one of the technicians in the testing area should also be trained and certified in advanced cardiac life sup -
port. Also, in accordance with AHA guidelines, a physician should be on the premises (e.g., in the building) at all times.
Prior to the start of a GXT, a resting electrocardiogram (EKG)
is performed to check for cardiac abnormalities that exist in the absence of “stress” and to provide a basis for comparison with your physiological responses during the exercise session. Both resting Basic Assessment
# Unit 10 127
blood pressure and heart rate are assessed and monitored through -
out a GXT. Electrodes (sensors) are placed on the chest during a
resting EKG. These sensors remain in place during a GXT so that the rhythm and electrical activity of the heart can be monitored continuously throughout the GXT. At rest, an EKG may indicate that the heart is receiving adequate amounts of blood and oxygen, but when the body is stressed (i.e., during exercise), an EKG may reveal signs that your heart is receiving insufficient amounts of blood and oxygen.
A variety of modalities (e.g., treadmill, stationary cycle, stair climb -
ing machine, etc.) can be used to provide the exercise stress. The
motor-driven treadmill is the device most commonly used in the United States for graded exercise testing. In general, a GXT initially involves placing a relatively low level of exercise-induced stress on the cardiovascular system. Subsequent increases in work demand are then gradually incorporated into the exercise protocol the client is required to perform by raising either the speed or grade (incline) of the treadmill. Because the goal of a GXT is simply to determine the capability limits of the cardiovascular system, you need not worry about the treadmill reaching “warp” speed or being raised to a grade that simulates Mount Everest.
Two different types of GXTs can be administered. One is referred
to as a symptom-limited maximal GXT and the other as a submax -
imal GXT. The symptom-limited maximal GXT is the more com -
mon of the two types of GXTs and involves progressively increasing the intensity of the exercise until signs or symptoms of exertion intolerance are displayed. The submaximal GXT, on the other hand, progressively increases the level of exercise intensity until a predetermined end point (e.g., 85% of your maximum heart rate) is reached or until a sign or symptom of exertion intolerance occurs (before the end point has been reached).
Who should have a Stress Test?
The current guidelines of the AHA (for both male and female) indi -
cate that individuals under age 40 who undergo a normal physical examination, which indicates no symptoms of cardiovascular dis -128Senior Fitness
ease, no coronary risk factors, no physical findings (including mur -
murs and hypertension), they can be considered free of disease and
do not require a GXT before undertaking a new exercise regimen. On the other hand, if you have a client 40 years of age or older with an abnormal physical examination (murmur, etc.) or two or more coronary risk factors, he/she should have a GXT before embarking on a vigorous exercise program.
In guidelines recently revised by the American College of Sports
Medicine (and subsequently adopted by ISSA), a GXT is not rec -
ommended prior to initiating an exercise program if your client is an asymptomatic male 40 years or younger or female 50 years or younger. If your client is an older asymptomatic adult (males 40-plus, females 50-plus), you may have him/her begin a moderate exercise regimen (intensity 40% to 60% maximum oxygen uptake capacity, or VO2 max) without a GXT. A GXT is
recommended for all clients for whom you are planning a vigorous exercise program (intensity greater than 60% VO2 max).
The ACSM and ISSA use the same cri -
teria of two or more primary risk fac -
tors as the basis for recommending a GXT prior to an individual beginning an exercise program. Moderate exer -
cise is, however, permitted without a GXT for individuals without coronary artery disease (CAD) symptoms but with two or more CAD risk factors. Individuals with two or more risk factors, but without symptoms, must undergo a GXT only before vigorous exercise.
How Safe is a GXT?
Like most medical procedures, a GXT is not without some risk. The risk can be minimized by proper screening and by having the test administered by properly trained personnel. As stated previously, Basic Assessment
# Unit 10 129
Your 40+ male and 50+ female cli-
ents need a GXT if they also have one of the following:
 • physical findings of cardiovascular
problems (murmur, hypertension, etc.)
 • symptoms of coronary artery or  cardiovascular disease
 • two or more coronary risk factors
 • exercising above 60% VO 2 max
personnel involved in conducting a GXT should be familiar with
the equipment and trained to handle emergency situations should they arise. Although unfavorable events (e.g., heart attacks) are well publicized, they are extremely rare (less than one per every 500 symptom-limited maximal GXTs). The risk of dying is much lower (less than 1 in 10,000).
What Information Does a GXT Provide?
In the early stages of CAD, individuals usually do not exhibit symptoms of coronary insufficiency while either at rest or during non-strenuous activity. During exercise, however, signs or symp -130Senior Fitness

Basic Assessment
# Unit 10 131
toms of CAD often become evident, as the demands for oxygen
increase beyond what the diseased arteries can deliver. If the oxygen demand and supply imbalance is relatively large, it can cause angi -
nal chest pain—a hallmark sign of CAD. Smaller oxygen imbalanc -
es can cause changes in heart rate, blood pressure and heart rhythm and may elicit changes on the EKG. An abnormal EKG during a GXT is only suggestive that a cardiac problem is present since the results of such tests are not always accurate. Approximately 10% to 20% of GXTs result in false positives (i.e., the test erroneously indi -
cates that an individual has heart disease). Unfortunately, a higher proportion (20% to 40%) of false negative (i.e., the test incorrectly indicates that an individual is free of heart disease) GXT results occur. Accordingly, when evaluating test results, the physician must consider all of the following: how long and through what stage the individual exercised, what your heart rate and blood pressure responses, whether any rhythm disturbances of heart occurred and when they occurred, whether any EKG abnormalities appeared, and how he/she looked and felt.
After the GXT
Once your client has taken a GXT, you should discuss the results with his or her doctor. If no problems are discovered, the infor -
mation provided by the GXT should then be used to design an appropriate exercise program for your client’s specific goals, needs, interests and fitness level. Should your client’s physician feel that his/her stress test was not accurate or was inconclusive, he or she may recommend a thallium exercise stress test in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the evaluative procedure.
Remember, it is impossible to “flunk” a GXT. If a problem is detect -
ed, it is much better to identify it in the controlled setting of a phy -
sician’s office, a hospital, an exercise science laboratory or a health
and fitness club than in your client’s own home. Finally, no matter who you are, or who your client is, both of you can benefit from participating in an exercise program based on the information obtained from a properly conducted GXT.
par QPhysical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
A Questionnaire for People Aged 15 to 69
Regular physical activity is fun and healthy, and increasingly more people are starting to become more active every day. Being more active is very
safe for most people. However, some people should check with their doctor before they start becoming much more physically active.
If you are planning to become much more physically active than you are now, start by answering the seven questions in the box below. If you
are between the ages of 15 and 69, the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) will tell you if you should check with your doctorbefore you start. If you are over 69 years of age and you are not used to being very active, check with your doctor.
Common sense is your best guide when you answer these questions. Please read the questions carefully and answer each one honestly: check
YES or NO.

INTENSITY OF EXERCISE:
# Target Heart Rate
The purpose of the target heart rate (THR) is to establish the
intensity of exercise necessary to produce a training effect on the cardiovascular system. Let’s use the Karvonen formula, which takes resting heart rate (HR
rest) into account.
Karvonen Formula for Target Heart Rate
Instructions Example
1. Start with 220*  220  220
2. Subtract age – age – 63
New number is the predicted age-adjusted maximum  157
3. Subtract resting heart rate (HR rest) – HRrest – 60
New number is the heart rate reserve (HRR)  97
4. Multiply by exercise intensity of 60-80% x 0.70 x 0.70
-Round to a whole number if needed-  68
5. Add resting heart rate back in + HRrest + 60
Target heart rate (beats/minute)  128  128
*If doing arm cycling, start with 210
Note: The maximal heart rate averages about ten beats lower for arm work than for leg work. Adjust your target heart rate for arm-crank ergometry by starting with 210.

# Unit 10 139
How to Take a Pulse
 1. Take a pulse at the thumb side of the wrist on
the palm or inner side of the forearm. Place your fingers at the area near the inside of the wrist and you will feel a throb there. Do not use your thumb because it has its own pulse. Do not take a pulse from the carotid arteries in the neck.
 2. Look at the second hand of a clock and count how many beats you feel in ten seconds. Multiply this number by six to obtain the pulse for one minute. If the pulse is weak and irregular, count for a full minute.
If an individual takes certain heart or blood pressure medications
(i.e., beta-blockers), the target rate during exercise may be lower than these calculations. Thus, you must rely on a system known as “Perceived Exertion.” This is called the Borg Scale. You rate how you feel during your exercise program. An overall feeling of effort is rated on a scale of 6 to 20. For a good cardiorespiratory training effect, aim for “somewhat hard.”
Borg Scale and Perceived Exertion
Borg Rating Perceived Exertion Examples (for most adults <65 years old)
6 None Reading a book, watching television
 7 to 8 Very, very light Tying shoes
 9 to 10 Very light Chores that seem to take little effort (e.g., folding clothes)
11 to 12 Fairly light Walking through the grocery store or other activities that require
some effort but not enough to speed up your breathing
13 to 14 Somewhat hard Brisk walking or other activities that require moderate effort. Heart rate and breathing rate increase, but you are not out of breath
15 to 16  Hard Bicycling, swimming, or other activities that take vigorous effort and get the heart pounding and make breathing very fast
17 to 18  Very hard The highest level of activity you can sustain
19 to 20  Very, very hard A finishing kick in a race or other burst of activity that you can’t maintain for long
Borg G.A. Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. 1982; 14:377-381.
140Senior Fitness
An even simpler way to determine exercise intensity is called the
“talk test.” If you are able to carry on a conversation while you are exercising, you are not working too hard. If you become out of breath and unable to talk, this is an indication for you to slow down.
Special Note for Clients with Spinal Cord Injuries
Due to disturbances in the sympathetic nervous system and partial paralysis of the arm and shoulder musculature, persons with spi -
nal cord lesions above thoracic nerve root 6 cannot use the target heart rate formula described above because of deficient exercise tachycardia: the heart rate reaches a ceiling between approximately 100 to 130 beats/minute. Therefore, the individual with this type of Moderate Activities:
Clients who have been inactive for a long time will need to work up to these activities gradually.Vigorous Activities:  Clients who have been inactive for a long time or those with health risks should not start with these activities.
Swimming Climbing stairs or hills
Bicycling Shoveling snow
Cycling on a stationary bicycle Brisk bicycling up hills
Gardening (mowing, raking) Digging holesWalking briskly Tennis (singles)
Mopping or scrubbing floor Swimming lapsGolf, without a cart Cross-country skiing
Tennis (doubles) Downhill skiing

Basic Assessment
# Unit 10 141
disability should not attempt to achieve his or her ceiling heart rate
during training bouts. Also, clients on beta blockers and pacemak -
ers should not rely on heart rates.
# Progressing
When your client is ready to progress, build up the amount of time spent doing endurance activities first; build up the difficulty of the activities later. For example, gradually increase the duration of endurance activities to thirty minutes over several days to weeks (or even months, depending on the individual’s condition) by walking longer distances, then walking up hills or walking more briskly.
A small increase in fitness can be all it takes to improve the ability
to do things like get up from a chair or climb stairs. Muscles are active even while we sleep. Cells are still doing the routine activities they need to do to stay alive. This work is called metabolism, and it uses up calories that can help keep your weight in check, even when you are asleep!

# Using Met Equivalents To
# Measure Exercise Intensity
All physical activities can be classified on the basis of their oxy -
gen requirements. The amount of oxygen your body consumes is
directly proportional to the energy you expend during the activity. At rest, your body consumes approximately 3.5 ml of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute. The resting level of oxygen consumption is referred to as l.0 MET. Thus, an eight-MET level would equal eight times the amount of oxygen you use at rest.
Although the MET method can be used for prescribing exercise
intensity, it has two serious limitations. First, various environmental factors such as heat, humidity, cold, wind, altitude, pollution, differ -
ences in terrain, etc., can change the way your cardiovascular system responds to a given MET level. As a result, your cardiovascular sys -
tem may be working harder at the same MET level. Also, as your level of fitness improves, different MET levels are required to ensure that the training stimulus is sufficient to produce continued improve -
ments. For these reasons, compared to MET equivalents, both THR and RPE are more commonly used to indicate exercise intensity. 142Senior Fitness

NO PAIN, NO GAIN . . . NO WAY!
The old adage—“no pain, no gain”—when applied to exercise—has
often led more than one unsuspecting individual to attempt to do too much. In fact, a strong argument could be made that “no pain, no gain equals no sense.” It is in your best interest to keep in mind that exercise does not have to “hurt” to produce improvements in fitness level. Whether someone is new to the “joys” of exercise or a profound fitness enthusiast, using the THR or RPE methods will make work -
outs more effective and more enjoyable.

Chair Stand Test
Place the chair against a wall for stability. Have your client sit in
the middle of the chair, feet flat on the floor, with arms crossed at the wrists and placed against their chest. You will time them for 30 seconds and count the number of full stands  they can complete.
A full stand is counted if the client:
•
 Doe
s not push off of thighs, the seat of the chair, or using any
other assistance.
• Ke
eps arms against chest and does not allow them to swing up
upon rising.

Arm Curl Test
Have the client sit in the chair. Women will use a 5 lb dumbbell in
each hand and men will use an 8 lb dumbbell in each hand. This may be modified if the client cannot lift the appropriate weight for their gender. You will not be able to use the norms if the client lifts a lighter weight, so note this on your scorecard. You will time your client for 30 seconds and count the number of full arm curls they
can complete.
A full arm curl is counted if the client:
•
 Sq
ueezes the lower arm to the upper arm at the top of the curl
and returns to a straight arm at the bottom.
• Ke
eps his or her upper arm against the body and does not swing
the weight.

Two-Minute Step Test
This is a variation of the step test given in the text book. You will
not need a 12” step for this test.
To begin, measure the midway point between your client’s knee cap and iliac crest. Then, measure from the floor to the midway point. Mark this distance on the wall (chalk or tape work well). This will be the measure you will use to count the client’s steps. Each knee must be lifted to this level.
You will time your client for 2 minutes and count the number of
full steps they can complete.
A full step cycle is counted:
•
 Wh
en both the right foot and left foot have lifted off from and
returned to the floor. Count one step cycle when the right knee
is lifted.
• If bo
th knees reach the appropriate height, as marked on the
wall.
Your client may rest as needed during this assessment.

Chair Sit and Reach
Place a chair against a wall for stability. Your client will sit down
and move forward in the chair until he/she is able to straighten one leg. The other foot should be flat on the ground. Your client will stack one hand on top of the other and try two practice reaches on each side. Your measurements will be taken on the side that is most flexible.
The stretch must be held for 2 seconds. No bouncing or jerking. No
grabbing the leg to hold the stretch.
To measure the stretch, place a ruler across the client’s toe at the 6”
mark with the zero end being closest to their body. The 6” mark will be your zero measurement. When the client reaches forward, you will mark the furthest point they reached on the ruler.
Examples: •
 If t
hey reach to 3”, this is a -3.0 score because it is before the toe.
• If t
hey reach to 10”, this is a +4.0 score because it is after the toe.

Up and Go
Place a chair against a wall for stability. Your client will sit down
with both feet flat on the floor and hands on their lap. Place a marker (a cone or piece of brightly colored tape) on the floor, 8 feet in front of the chair with a straight and direct path from the chair to the marker.
To score this test you will use a stop watch to time how long it takes
your client to get up from the chair, walk to and around the marker and sit back down in the chair.
You will score to the nearest 0.1 (one tenth) of a second.

Back Scratch Test
Your client will get two practice stretches on each side before you
score this assessment. Score the side that is most flexible. Record the best score of two stretches. The client will raise their left arm straight up in the air above the left shoulder and bend the elbow, reaching the finger tips toward the middle of their shoulder blades. The right arm will then be extended down, with the palm out. Bend the elbow and reach the fingers up to touch the fingers of the left hand. Finger tips just touching is a score of “0”. A positive score is recorded if fingers overlap. A negative score is recorded if the fin -
gers do not touch.
Score to the nearest 0.5 (half) inch.

# Unit Summary
 I. Every exercise program should begin with an assess-
ment of your client’s physical fitness level. Assessment should be done during the course of your initial con
-
sultation to review in depth any medical or chronic conditions that your client presents. Request medical clearance if necessary and inquire about work parame-ters for more serious conditions.
A.
 Once you reach a decision to have your client start
exercising, his/her physician may recommend that he/she undergo a graded exercise test (GXT) before beginning an exercise regimen.
1.
 There are two types of GXTs: symptom-limited
maximal GXT and submaximal GXT.
 a. Symptom-limited: increase in exercise intensity until signs or symptoms of exertion intolerance occur
 b. Submaximal: increase of exercise intensity until a prede-termined end point or until a sign or symptom of exer

B. Several techniques exist for the monitoring of acceptable levels of exercise intensity. The most widely used methods are: target heart rate (THR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and metabolic equivalent units (METS).
 1. THR range = maximal HR x 0.70 and 0.85
a.  70% and 85% of maximal heart rate is equal to approxi-
mately 60% and 80% of functional capacity VO 2 max.
2. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) refers to the
physical strain individuals believe they are experi-encing while exercising.
 a. RPE is often one of the first readily recognizable measures
of (positive) changes in aerobic fitness.
 3. The resting level of oxygen consumption is
referred to as l.0 MET.
 a. At rest, your body consumes approximately 3.5 ml of
oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.

# Unit Summary
C. The Senior Fitness Test, developed by Dr. Roberta Rikli
and Dr. Jessie Jones, is an easy-to-use battery of test items that assesses fitness levels of older adults. The Senior Fitness Test consists of six assessments used to measure aerobic fitness, strength, and flexibility. The six assessments; the chair stand test, arm curl test, 2-minute step in place test, chair sit and reach test, 8-foot up and go test, and back scratch test were developed to be safe and enjoyable for older adults, while still meeting scien-tific standards for reliability and validity.

After completing this unit you will be able to:

for older adults
 • Make recommendations for frequency, intensity, and safety in the cardiovascular training of older adults
The cardiovascular system includes the heart, lungs, and vascular
system, which are critical to a good quality of life. Part of the disuse syndrome that occurs when an individual is immobilized is the loss of cardiovascular endurance. This reduction in aerobic capacity has many health implications in regard to obesity and heart disease. Regular, moderate physical activity may aid efforts to control ciga-rette smoking, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, diabetes, obesity, and emotional stress. This unit provides some guidelines for insti-tuting a cardiovascular training program with the special needs of older adults in mind.
Cardiovascular exercise is one of the most important components
of physical fitness. Not only does it help increase the ability of the circulatory system to carry oxygen and necessary nutrients to every cell of the body more effectively, but it also helps prevent heart disease. Since heart disease is the leading cause of death in this country, cardiovascular exercise is a preventive measure everyone, including the older adult, should participate in regularly.
Cardiovascular exercises are those exercises that require the body’s
circulatory system to work harder to meet the demands of the exercise. For example, when one climbs a flight of stairs the heart will begin to beat faster, and breathing will become deeper and faster. These are cardiovascular adjustments necessary to transport more oxygen throughout the body in order to meet the demands of climbing a flight of stairs. If you were to climb consecutive flights of stairs without stopping and you were to do this for approximately twenty minutes, this would then be considered aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise requires oxygen and sustained effort.
Aerobic exercises are those types of activities that are long, slow,
and continuous, and require the use of large muscle groups (for example, walking or swimming). In order for the cardiovascular system (heart, lungs, arteries, veins, etc.) to benefit from cardio-vascular exercise, it is important to maintain an exercise intensity that elevates the heart rate to a target zone. Both age and current level of fitness determine this target zone as discussed in unit 10.
# Frequency Of Exercise
Researchers generally agree that cardiovascular training should occur between three and five times per week. Participating in some form of physical activity every day is recommended. Cardiovascular training is especially important for the older client whose sedentary lifestyle may have already compromised cardiovascular endurance. As cardiovascular endurance improves, a progression to cardiovas-cular exercise as a part of the daily routine is recommended. 154Senior Fitness
Help your client build up his or her endurance gradually, starting
out with as little as five minutes of endurance activities at a time, if need be. Starting out at a lower level of effort and working up to a more vigorous workout gradually is especially important if an individual has been inactive for a long time. It may take months to go from a long-standing sedentary lifestyle to doing some of the activities suggested in this unit. The goal is to work your way up, eventually, to a moderate-to-vigorous level of activity that increases breathing and heart rate and feels somewhat hard.
Once you reach the goal, exercise can be divided into sessions of
no less than ten minutes at a time, as long as they add up to a total of at least thirty minutes at the end of the day. Doing less than ten minutes at a time won’t provide the desired cardiovascular and respiratory system benefits. The exception to this guideline is when an individual has first made the decision to begin doing endurance activities, and is just starting out. The goal in this case is to build up to a total of at least thirty minutes of endurance exercise on four to seven days of the week. More often is better, and every day is best. Cardiovascular Fitness and the Older Adult
# Unit 11 155

heat stroke: A life threat-
ening illness when the
body’s temperature-reg-ulating mechanisms fail. Bod temperature may rise to over 104 degrees F, skin appears red, dry, and warm to the touch. The victim has chills, sometimes nau-sea and dizziness, and may be confused or irrational. Seizures and coma may follow unless temperature is brought down to 102 degrees within an hour. Seek medical attention immediately if you or your client experiences these symptoms.
hypothermia: Body tem-
perature below normal. Usually due to exposure to cold temperatures, espe-cially after exhausting ready energy supplies. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Endurance activities should not make clients breathe so hard that
they can’t carry on a conversation with you. Participation should not cause dizziness or chest pain. Have your client do some kind of light activity before and after your endurance exercise session to warm up and cool down (for example, easy walking). Have your client stretch after endurance activities when his or her muscles are warm.
As we get older, our bodies may become less likely to trigger the
urge to drink when we need water. In other words, we may need water, but we won’t feel thirsty. Be sure to encourage your client to drink fluids when doing any activity that causes loss of fluid through sweat. The rule-of-thumb is that by the time we notice we are thirsty, we are already somewhat dehydrated. This guideline is important year-round, but it is especially important in hot weath-er, when dehydration is more likely. If your client’s doctor has recommended a limit on fluids, be sure to check with him or her before recommending an increase in fluid intake while exercising. Congestive heart failure and kidney disease are examples of chronic diseases that often require fluid restriction.
Another safety consideration when working with older adults is that they can be affected by heat and cold more often than other adults. In extreme cases, exposure to too much heat can cause heat stroke, and exposure to very cold tem-peratures can lead to hypothermia
(a dangerous drop in body tem-perature). When exercising out-doors, suggest your client dress in layers so clothes may be added or removed as needed. 156Senior Fitness

Always use safety equipment to prevent injuries. Make sure your
client wears a helmet for bicycling and wears protective equipment for activities like skiing and skating. Also be sure your client wears appropriate shoes designed for the exercise they are performing.
# Cardiovascular Exercises
# Walking
Walking is the safest form of exercise and yet one of the most benefi -
cial. Walking does not require a lot of equipment, it can be done con -
tinuously at almost anytime, anywhere, and injuries are infrequent. To ensure safety, encourage your client to walk in an area that has Cardiovascular Fitness and the Older Adult
# Unit 11 157
plenty of light, especially when walking in the evening, and make sure that the walking surface is smooth and stable. Shopping malls are popular sites in which to walk. They provide plenty of space and a safe and well-lit environment and are usually kept at a constant temperature. The only equipment necessary is a good pair of prop -
erly fitted walking shoes, which provide plenty of support and trac -
tion. It is also important to wear comfortable clothing, which allows a person to move freely and doesn’t constrict bodily movement.
The treadmill provides anoth-
er convenient option for walkers. Instructions for operation are usu-ally listed on the machine. Be sure the client has read and understands the instructions prior to using the treadmill. Make sure that each per-son has the physician’s and the physical therapist’s permission before using the treadmill. Have the person straddle the belt before turning the power on. Encourage the person to walk upright and at the front of the belt. Make sure that the person slows before stop-ping, instead of just stopping abruptly.
# Swimming And Water Exercises
Considered one of the best forms of exercise, aqua-activities are ideal for those who may suffer any orthopedic difficulties. Not only does water exercise allow the orthopedically disadvantaged the opportunity to participate freely, it also provides an environment that is quite relaxing. Water exercisers are far less susceptible to injuries due to the body’s buoyancy and the resistance of the water. Water exercise requires one to use all of the major muscle groups, thus making it an excellent aerobic exercise if done continuously. 158Senior Fitness

# Bicycling
Bicycling is another excellent form of aerobic exercise if done con-
tinuously. Not only does it help increase cardiovascular endurance, but it also helps increase muscular strength and endurance of the leg muscles. For those who have difficulty with balance or lack a safe place to ride, a stationary bicycle provides the same benefits. With a stationary bicycle, one need not worry about traffic or outdoor con-ditions. It allows you the opportunity to exercise at any time inside and even in the privacy of your own home.
Whether cycling outdoors or on a
stationary bicycle, it is necessary to exercise continuously for a mini-mum of twenty minutes to achieve the greatest cardiovascular benefit. Recumbent bikes are good alter-natives for those who cannot use upright bikes because of poor bal-ance, a bad back, or some other phys-ical limitation.
When using a bike, adjust the seat so
the person will have a 15º bend in the extended leg when cycling. Check to see that the knees are aligned with the toes while pedaling. Special pedals, blocks, and straps are available for stationary bikes for persons whose legs are too short to reach the pedals.
When a person actually lacks the ability to mount the stationary
bicycle, he or she may cycle while seated in a chair or wheelchair positioned behind the bicycle (the bicycle seat is removed). If a chair is used, the chair should be backed up to a wall so that it will not tip over backward during pedaling. If a wheelchair is being used, always lock wheelchair brakes! If the bicycle slides around, place rubber pads under its legs. Cardiovascular Fitness and the Older Adult

paraplegia: An impair-
ment in motor and/or sen-
sory function of the lower extremities. It is usually the result of spinal cord injury or a congenital condition.REHAB TRAINERS (ARM CYCLES)
Studies involving arm pedaling have primarily used interval
training for improving fitness parameters of those with lower-ex-tremity disabilities. Significant improvements in physiologic responses have occurred using three four-minute work bouts sep-arated by two-minute rest intervals. For persons with paraplegia, improvements have been achieved when alternating one-minute bouts of high and low work rates, progressing to thirty minutes of continuous high work rate by the nineteenth week of training.
Assist the person to sit with the
body lined up with the center of the machine. If in a wheelchair, lock the brakes. Adjust the machine so that the fulcrum of the crank arm is even with the shoulder height of the person. Check for possible friction spots on the person’s skin.
# Lower Body Ergometry
The usefulness of training by lower body cycling has been proven time and time again in research. While we encourage our older clients to participate in weight bearing activity to improve mobility and bone mineral density, the benefits of this low impact exer-cise should not be overlooked. Older clients who have mobility problems benefit from cycling both by developing cardiovascular endurance and leg strength.160Senior Fitness

 V. Safety
While some older adults are as strong as some sedentary younger
adults, it is probably safe to assume that many of the clients you will work with will have brittle bones and weak tendons, ligaments, and muscles. The goal of most older adults is to get fit for life, and since pushing them too hard will only set them up for failure, it is best to begin slowly and progress gradually. It is critical to keep in mind that changes seen in the soft tissue and bone mineral density of older adults require that any exercises they do follow sound bio-mechanical principles. It is also important to remember that more is not necessarily better when it comes to working with the begin-ning older adult client relative to strength training.
# Goals And Techniques
When strength training with older adults, it often makes sense for
exercises to have a functional fitness goal. For example, exercises to make getting out of the chair easier or carrying the groceries easier can have a noticeable impact on clients’ daily activities and highlight the benefits of the training you are doing together. That is why choosing activities that will improve your client’s quality of life is usually a good way to begin.
The first few weeks or even months of training should be dedicated
to teaching proper lifting techniques. Teaching the correct tech-nique is far more important than increasing the amount of weight lifted. Improper lifting techniques will lead to injury and to clients dropping out of their exercise program. Encourage your clients to ask you questions and make them become familiar with the mus-cles they are working in each exercise.
Many different formulas exist to determine a training load, but
this need not be a consideration until the client knows how to lift without “cheating.” Otherwise the training load determination will be based upon bad information (i.e., clients can curl more weight when they use body momentum as opposed to standing against the wall and trying to do a curl.) Teach the client to be able to perform each movement for at least eight reps in a row without breaking form. If they can’t do eight reps correctly, the weight is too heavy.
To avoid injuries and enhance the benefits of strength training,
complete an adequate thermal warm-up before lifting and finish with a comprehensive flexibility program after lifting. After the client is warmed up, start the workout with compound exercises before you progress to isolated muscle group exercises (i.e., do bench presses before triceps extensions).
As you plan your client’s workout, keep in mind that the body has
agonistic muscles and antagonistic muscles. If you have a client do an exercise on the front side, follow with an exercise for an antag-onistic muscle group on the back side. Some trainers call this the 164Senior Fitness
“push /pull” method (working hamstrings/quadriceps, chest/back,
etc.) It is important to note that many older adults have adaptive shortening of some muscles, for example, tight shoulder and chest muscles that cause round shoulders. In this case it would be wise to stretch the tight muscles and strengthen the weak muscles.
Remember: do it right and do it slowly! It is very important to
constantly remind the client to maintain a slow and purposeful movement, lifting the weight slowly and lowering it just as slowly. Smooth controlled movements will produce gradual but safe results.
Also make sure that your client breathes normally! Instruct your
client to breathe one inhalation and exhalation per repetition. Too many people just forget to breathe when lifting weights, especially when they start to go for heavier weights. Strength Training Guidelines
# Unit 12 165
Evaluate Programs and Participants Before Exercise
 1. While exercise benefits even the frail elderly, programs need to be carefully
tailored for seniors. A number of factors should be assessed before older patients begin unsupervised exercise programs.
2.

 Cognitive function is an important consideration. Judgment, memory and alertness should all be evaluated, and patients with impairment may need supervision while exercising.
3.

 Flexibility and manual strength should be assessed to determine where weakness and limited ranges of motion lie.
4.

 Endurance testing can indicate undiagnosed heart problems and show heart rate targets, but such testing is not possible in many frail patients.
 5.  Medications and existing diseases may limit exercise programs. Motor problems, dietary deficiencies, heart problems and pulmonary disease all indicate the need for special evaluation, as does the use of some drugs, including diuretics, psychotropics and antiarrhythmics.

# Phases Of A
# Strength Training Program
A progressive program should be broken down into phases so that
clients are safely moved along the training path towards their goals. This allows a learning process to occur for both the client and the trainer. The client learns the right way to train safely and effective-ly, and the trainer gets an opportunity to find out more about the client’s goals and physical capabilities.
Phase One—Weeks 1 & 2: “Knowledge is Power” Phase
 1. The purpose of this phase is to educate your clients so
that they train smart.
 2. Teach before you train.
 3. Progressively work up to lifting one set of fifteen repeti-tions with a relatively light amount of weight. This regi
-
men continues for approximately two weeks. Use this time to teach perfect form.
 4. Instruct your client to breathe naturally during exercise.
Phase Two—Week 3: “Train Don’t Strain” Concepts
 1. Aim to have the client work towards doing one to two sets of seven to fifteen repetitions for all the major  muscle groups.
 2. Again, remind the client to breathe; it does not matter if you exhale on effort or inhale on relaxation as long as

you don’t hold your breath. Each exercise has a different breathing pattern (i.e., the breathing pattern on a bench press is different than the breathing pattern of a lateral pull).
 3. Teach the client to be able to distinguish between good muscle pain and bad joint pain. Some muscle soreness can

be expected especially if the client was extremely seden-166Senior Fitness
tary. Teach the client to listen to his or her body and, as
their trainer, listen to what they say. The recommenda-tions outlined in this phase are not going to produce great strength gains in a short period but will be successful in keeping the older adult engaged in strength training for a longer period of time. Constantly explain that proper body mechanics are critical to prevent injury.
 4. Remind your client to check body position during each exercise: ears over shoulders, soft knees, straight wrists, neutral spine.
Phase Three—Week 4:  Going Strong and Keeping It Up!
 1. Vary client workouts to prevent burnout, injury, and  boredom.
 2. Individualize! There is no perfect exercise; if the client feels pain then you must adapt, modify, or eliminate until the client can do the activity without any residual discomfort.
 3. A good trainer will progressively overload the muscle. As the muscle gets stronger, challenge the muscle with addi-tional load or with a different exercise that works the same muscle group.
 4. It is very important to avoid controversial exercises with this population. While some exercises might be okay for

younger or fitter clients, they might be ill advised for some older adult clients. Overhead lifts and deep squats are examples of such exercises.
 5. As your older client becomes more advanced, use extra caution when using movements such as high intensity lifts

or isometric activities that can increase intratracheal pres-sure. Such exercises include heavy bench presses, heavy
leg presses, and overhead lifts.Strength Training Guidelines
# Unit 12 167
# Strength Exercises
Even very small changes in muscular development can make a big
difference in strength, especially in people who are already decon-ditioned and have generalized atrophy. Slightly improved muscle strength can be all it takes to improve one’s ability to do things like get up from a chair or climb stairs.
To do most of the following strength exercises, you need to
lift or push weights, and you need to keep gradually increasing the amount of weight you use. You can use the hand and ankle weights sold in sporting-goods stores, or you can use things like emptied milk jugs filled with sand or water, or socks filled with beans and tied shut at the ends. There are many alternatives to the exercises shown here. For example, you can buy a resistance band at a sporting-goods store for under $10. Stretching it builds mus-
cle and helps in other types of strength exercis-es. Or you can use the special strength-training equipment at a fitness center. Regardless of what kind of equipment you use with your cli-ents, make sure it is safe and effective.
The following exercises are among many that
you may use in getting your clients started. These exercises were drawn from Exercise: A Guide from the National Institute of Aging. You will notice that the directions are geared towards the client rather than you as the train-er; however, this makes them ideal for creat-ing instructional handouts for your client to
take home.
# Lateral Raise
Strengthens shoulder muscles. Sit in a chair, with your back straight. Your feet should be flat on the floor, spaced apart so that they are 168Senior Fitness

even with your shoulders. Hold hand weights straight down at
your sides, with your palms facing inward. Take three seconds to lift your arms straight out, sideways, until they are parallel to the ground. Hold the position for one second. Take three seconds to lower your arms so that they are straight down by your sides again. Pause. Repeat eight to fifteen times. Rest. Do another set of eight to fifteen repetitions.
# Biceps Curl
Strengthens upper-arm muscles. Sit in an arm-less chair, with your back supported by the back of the chair. Your feet should be flat on the floor, spaced apart so that they are even with your shoulders. Hold hand weights down at your side, palms facing in toward your body. Take three seconds to lift your left-hand weight toward your chest by bending your elbow. As you lift, turn your left hand so that your palm is facing your shoulder. Hold the position for one second. Take three seconds to lower your hand to the starting position. Pause, and then repeat with right arm. Alternate until you have repeated the exercise eight to fifteen times on each side. Rest, and then do another set of eight to fifteen alternating repetitions.
# Triceps Extension
(Note: If your shoulders aren’t flexible enough to do this exercise, see alternative “Dip” exercise that follows.)
Strengthens muscles in back of upper arm. Sit in a chair, toward
the front. Your feet should be flat on the floor, spaced apart so that they are even with your shoulders. Hold a weight in your left hand, and raise your left arm all the way up, so that it’s pointing toward Figure 12-2 Biceps Curl

the ceiling, palm facing in. Support your left arm by holding it
just below the elbow with your right hand. Slowly bend your left arm so that the weight in your left hand now rests behind your left shoulder. Take three seconds to straighten your left arm so that it’s pointing toward the ceiling again. Hold the position for one second. Take three seconds to lower the weight back to your shoulder by bending your elbow. Keep supporting your left arm with your right hand throughout the exercise. Pause, then repeat the bending and

straightening until you have done the exercise eight to fifteen times
with your left arm. Reverse positions and repeat eight to fifteen times with your right arm. Rest, and then repeat another set of eight to fifteen repetitions on each side.
ALTERNATIVE “DIP” EXERCISE
# For Back Of Upper Arm
Sit in a chair with arm rests. Make sure the chair is heavy enough
and stable enough to support dips. Lean slightly forward, keeping your back and shoulders straight. Hold onto the arms of the chair. Your hands should be level with the trunk of your body, or slightly farther forward. Place your feet slightly under the chair, with your heels off the ground and the weight of your feet and legs resting on your toes and the balls of your feet. Slowly lift yourself up, using your arms, as high as you can. This pushing motion will strengthen your arm muscles even if you aren’t yet able to lift yourself up off of the chair. Don’t use your legs or feet for assistance, or use them as little as possible. Slowly lower yourself back down. Repeat eight to fifteen times. Rest, and then repeat another eight to fifteen times.
# Knee Flexion
Strengthens muscles in back of thigh. Stand straight, very close to a table or chair, holding it for balance. Take three seconds to bend your left knee so that your calf comes as far up toward the back of your thigh as possible. Don’t move your upper leg at all; bend your knee only. Take three seconds to lower your left leg all the way back down. Repeat with right leg. Alternate legs until you have done eight to fifteen repetitions with each leg. Rest, and then do another set of eight to fifteen alternating repetitions. Use ankle weights when you are ready to progress.
Figure 12-4 Knee Flexion

# Hip Flexion
Strengthens thigh and hip muscles. Stand to the side or behind a
chair or table, holding it with one hand for balance. Take three sec-onds to bend your left knee and bring it as far toward your chest as possible. Stand straight throughout, without bending at the waist or hips. Hold position for one second, and then take three seconds to lower your left leg all the way down. Repeat with right leg; alter-nate legs until you have done eight to fifteen repetitions on each side. Rest, and then do another set of eight to fifteen alternating repetitions. Add ankle weights when you are ready to progress.
# Shoulder Flexion
Strengthens shoulder muscles. Sit in a chair, with back straight. Feet should be flat on the floor, spaced apart so that they are even with your shoulders. Hold hand weights straight down at your sides, with your palms facing inward. Take three seconds to lift your arms in front of you, keeping them straight and rotating them so that your palms are facing upward, until your arms are parallel to the ground. Hold the position for one second. Take three sec-onds to lower your arms so that they are straight down by your sides again. Pause. Repeat eight to fifteen times. Rest; do another set of eight to fifteen repetitions.
# Knee Extension
Strengthens muscles in front of thigh and shin. Sit in a chair, with your back resting against the back of the chair. If your feet are flat on the floor in this position, you should place a rolled-up towel under your knees to lift them up. Only the balls of your feet and your toes should be resting on the floor. Rest your hands on your thighs or on the sides of the chair. Take three seconds to extend your right leg in front of you, parallel to the floor, until your knee is straight. With your right leg in this position, flex your foot so that your toes are pointing toward your head; hold your foot in this position for one to two seconds. Take three seconds to lower your
right leg back to the starting position, so that the ball of your foot 172Senior Fitness

Figure 12-7 Knee Extension

rests on the floor again. Repeat with left leg. Alternate legs, until
you have done the exercise eight to fifteen times with each leg. Rest; then do another set of eight to fifteen alternating repetitions. Use ankle weights when you are ready to progress.
# Hip Extension
Strengthens buttock and lower-back muscles. Stand twelve to eigh-teen inches away from a table or chair, feet slightly apart. Bend forward from the hips, at about a 45-degree angle, holding onto the table or chair for balance. In this position, take three seconds to lift your left leg straight behind you without bending your knee, point-ing your toes, or bending your upper body any farther forward. Hold the position for one second. Take three seconds to lower your left leg back to the starting position. Repeat with right leg. Alternate legs, until you have repeated the exercise eight to fifteen times with each leg. Rest; then do another set of eight to fifteen alternating repetitions with each leg. Add ankle weights when you are ready to progress.
# Side Leg Raise
Strengthens muscles at sides of hips and thighs. Stand up straight, directly behind a table or chair, feet slightly apart. Hold onto the table to help keep your balance. Take three seconds to lift your right leg six to twelve inches out to the side. Keep your back and both legs straight. Don’t point your toes outward—keep them fac-ing forward. Hold the position for one second. Take three seconds to lower your leg back to the starting position. Repeat with left leg. Alternate legs, until you have repeated the exercise eight to fifteen times with each leg. Rest, and do another set. Use ankle weights when you are ready to progress.
# Frequency And Intensity
Recommend to your client that strength exercises for all of the major muscle groups be within the training program, and don’t schedule strength exercises of the same muscle group on any two days in a row. Strength Training Guidelines
# Unit 12 173

Figure 12-9 Side Leg Raise

Some older clients might need to start out using as little as one or
two pounds of weight, or no weight at all. The connective tissues that bind the structures of one’s body together need to adapt to strength exercises. Have your client use a minimum of weight the first week, and then gradually build up the weight. Starting out with weights that are too heavy (or, in some cases, starting with any weight at all) can cause injuries. Use this time to help your client develop perfect form and an understanding of which muscle is being trained. At the same time, remember that you have to gradually add a challenging amount of weight in order for your clients to benefit from strength exercises. If you don’t challenge their muscles, they won’t benefit from strength exercises. Stretch your client after strength exercises, when their muscles are warmed up. When stretching before strength exercise, make sure they warm up first with light cardio exercise (light walking and arm pumping, for example).
# Safety
Instruct your clients not to hold their breath. Remind them to breathe normally. Holding one’s breath while straining can cause changes in blood pressure. This is especially true for people with cardiovascular disease.

If your client has had a hip repair or replacement, check with the doctor who did their surgery before doing lower-body exercises.

Don’t allow these clients to cross their legs, or bend their hips farther than a 90-degree angle. Avoid jerking or thrusting move-ments that can cause injuries. Instead, use smooth, steady move-ments. Avoid “locking” the joints in arms and legs into tightly straightened position. (Tip: To have your client straighten their knees, ask them to tighten the thigh muscles; this will lift their kneecaps and protect them.)
Muscle soreness lasting up to a few days and slight fatigue is nor-
mal following muscle-building exercises; however, exhaustion, sore joints, and unpleasant muscle pulling aren’t. The latter symp-toms mean you are overworking your client. None of the exercises should cause pain. The range within which you have your clients move their arms and legs should never hurt.174Senior Fitness
Guidelines for a Safe
& Beneficial Strength Program
1.  Keep accurate, daily records
of your participant’s per-formance. This procedure includes recording the date, poundage used, and the number of sets and reps performed.
2.
 Retest every few weeks to reestablish the 1RM (if appropriate).
3.
 Supervise with a spotter (assistant) when a partici-pant is lifting weights — no matter the poundage!
4.
 Alternate upper and lower body exercises so no two consecutive exercises involve the same prime mover.
5.
 Perform exercises that involve larger muscle  groups first. For example, perform shoulder strength
-

 Each repetition should be performed in a smooth and controlled manner.
# Unit Summary
 I. Strength training for many older adults involves function-
al fitness, that is, developing strength that will assist the person in carrying out their daily activities. Exercises that make getting out of a chair or carrying the groceries easier can have a significant impact on the older client’s quality of life.
 II. Employing proper technique when strength training with older adults is important to help avoid injury.
 a. In the beginning, focus on teaching proper lifting  techniques.
 b. Make sure the client can do eight reps correctly before increasing the training load.
 c. Warm up before lifting and stretch afterwards.
 d. Keep in mind the need to balance working agonistic muscles with antagonistic muscles.
 e. Encourage slow, purposeful movements.
 f. Encourage the client to breathe!
 III. A strength training program should be broken down into phases so that clients are moved along safely toward their goals. In Phase One, the focus is on education. In Phase Two, the client works toward doing one to two sets of seven to fifteen repetitions for all major muscle groups. And in Phase Three, the client learns principles for main-taining a long-term pattern of strength training.
 IV. Many effective exercises exist that can be safely incorpo-rated into a strength training program for older adults. Examples include the lateral raise, the biceps curl, the tri
-
ceps extension, knee flexion, and hip flexion, to name just a few.
 V. A strength training program should include exercises for all of the major muscle groups, and working the same muscle group any two days in a row should be avoided. Clients should begin with a light weight and gradually build up.Strength Training Guidelines

Flexibility is critical for older adults. Participating in flexibility
training allows the client to improve their level of health. The abil-ity to perform activities of daily living is greatly enhanced when a person regularly engages in a physical activity program that includes stretching.
# Optimal Conditions
# For Eliciting A Stretch
Connective tissue displays both properties of elasticity (the ability to rebound to original length) and plasticity (the ability to undergo deformation without rupture). To increase flexibility, it is import-ant to affect the plastic property of connective tissue. To achieve the optimal conditions for a permanent increase in flexibility keep the following things in mind.
Engage in Warm-Up Prior to Stretching
Increased tissue temperature will increase the viscous (plastic) property of connective tissue, resulting in a greater elongation or stretch. In other words, a warm muscle will stretch farther than a cold one! Warm-up may include easy laps around the track, walk-ing, riding a stationary cycle, or doing calisthenics until a sweat is broken (five to ten minutes). The same result may be achieved by performing calisthenics in place.
Do Not Apply Too Much Force to the Stretch
Lower amounts of force induce less injury and tearing to connec-tive tissue than high amounts of force. Vigorous or ballistic stretch-ing may cause bleeding in the joint, as well as tearing of soft tissue.
Hold the Stretch for a Sufficient Duration
Although research has not demonstrated what the optimal dura-tion for a stretch is, many believe that assisted and active stretching is best. For purposes of this manual, it is suggested that each stretch be held for a duration of thirty to sixty seconds. 178Senior Fitness
edema: Swelling from
excessive accumulation of
watery fluid in cells, tissues, or serous cavities.Perform Stretching through
the Pain-Free Range of Motion
Do not perform stretching if pain, infection, or edema (swelling) is
present. Stretching while pain is present could cause the problem to worsen, thereby delaying the healing process.
Incorporate Stretches at the End of Cool-Down
To prevent adaptive shortening and promote the relaxation of muscle, be sure to stretch after training. Muscle which has been subjected to a vigorous workout will generally be in a contracted state. Performing stretching at the end of the workout will return muscle to its resting length and promote additional elongation of connective tissue.
# Stretching Techniques
There are two basic types of stretching techniques: active and passive. Active stretching is performed without assistance, using a volitional muscle contraction, while passive stretching is performed Maintaining Flexibility As We Age
# Unit 13 179

proprioceptive
neuromuscular
facilitation (PNF):
Muscle stretches that use
the proprioceptors (muscle spindles) to send inhibit-ing (relaxing) messages to the muscle that is to be stretched. with the aid of an assistant. The range of motion of a joint is usually
greater in a passive stretch than an active one. PNF (propriocep-tive neuromuscular facilitation) Hold-Relax is a technique that utilizes both active and passive stretching.
ACTIVE STRETCHING (SLOW STATIC)
This technique involves slowly stretching a muscle for thirty to sixty seconds (or longer) by contracting the opposing muscle group. If proper stretching is to be accomplished, the lengthened muscle must be held at the point of limitation with a tension level that does not activate, to any marked extent, the stretch reflex mechanism. After holding the stretch for a period of time, the dis-comfort of tension should diminish to some degree. At this time, the individual may increase the stretch and establish a new point of limitation. This process can be repeated until no further range of motion is attainable. Discomfort that becomes greater the longer the stretch is held or quivering or vibrating of the lengthened mus-cle signals overstretching. Avoid bouncing or ballistic movements.
# Passive Stretching
This technique is applied when the individual cannot perform an active stretch. It is performed by the trainer and involves stretch-ing every affected joint to prevent contractures from developing through disuse. The trainer moves each joint slowly through the permissible range-of-motion, using one hand to stabilize the body while the other moves the limb. Hold at the point of limitation for thirty to sixty seconds. Prolonged, moderate stretching is more effective than momentary, vigorous stretching. Two to five repeti-tions are usually sufficient for passive range of motion.
PNF (PROPRIOCEPTIVE NEUROMUSCULAR
FACILITATION) HOLD-RELAX
PNF hold-relax is a relaxation/lengthening technique in which the
individual isometrically and maximally contracts a muscle group 180Senior Fitness
Golgi Tendon Organs:
Nerve sensors (“proprio-ceptors”), located at the junction of muscles and tendons, that pick up mes-sages of excess stress on the muscle and cause the brain to shut off muscle contraction. The purpose may be to protect against separating the tendon from bone when a contraction is too great. prior to stretching it to a new point of limitation. The contraction
is held for six seconds. When the maximal number of motor units is contracting simultaneously, the Golgi Tendon Organs within that muscle will fire, causing the muscle to relax. This phenome-non is known as autogenic inhibition. During this post-contrac-tion depression, lasting for about six seconds, the Golgi Tendon Organs override the reflex activity of the muscle spindles. The individual or assistant then moves the limb to a new point of lim-itation. The sequence is repeated until no new further range of motion is obtainable.
Hold-Relax Sequence:
 1. The trainer (passively) or the participant (actively)
moves the limb to the point of limitation. Active move-ment should be encouraged whenever possible. The participant then isometrically and maximally contracts the muscle being stretched against a resistance provid
-
ed by the trainer for six seconds . This is the hold period
of the technique, and the limb should not be allowed to move. The maximal contraction should be brought on gradually, not suddenly.
 2. The participant then relaxes the stretched muscle and moves the limb to a new point of limitation, either actively or passively, with help of the trainer. This
relaxation  period for the stretched muscle should last
six seconds . Repeat the sequence of holds and relax-
ation until no further range of motion is obtained.
# Isokinetic Exercise
The participant contracts the agonist muscle group through the
range of motion against a lever of constant speed, thereby achiev-ing a maximal effort at every point in the range. Because it accom-modates the strength changes that occur as the joint angle changes, isokinetic exercise theoretically enables one to perform more work than with isotonic methods. Only reciprocal movements with con-centric contractions occur with isokinetic exercise. The exerciser does not lift weight but pushes against a lever that moves at a fixed Maintaining Flexibility As We Age

isokinetic exercise:
Exercise equipment using
accommodating resistance technology. For example, Keiser equipment uses compressed air to provide accommodating resistance. With this form of isokinet-ic movement, the harder you push the harder the machine resists, providing the net effect of controlling the speed of movement.
speed in both directions (e.g., flexion/extension). Thus, it allows
the instructor to measure strength imbalances about a joint (e.g., knee flexors should be approximately 60% the strength of the knee extensors at slower velocities of movement). Isokinetic devices offer a range of speeds to select for training.
# Contraindications For
# Performing Stretching
 1. Infections around a joint.
 2. Exacerbation (attacks) of inflammatory disease, especially when pain is present.
 3. Edema—joint capsule is subject to tears.
 4. Functional contractures (e.g., finger flexors, elbow flexors, and pronators may actually assist the par-ticipant to pull objects toward him or her).
# Performance Requirements For Stretching Techniques
 1. Know the anatomical motions that occur at each
joint. (Review Unit 4 of Fitness: The Complete Guide
from your CFT course.)
 2. Stabilize the extremities at the joint, for example at
the elbow or wrist. For someone with a painful joint, such as in arthritis, support the extremity in the mus-cular area.
 3. Try to avoid touching the muscle or tendons being stretched as this may trigger unwanted reflex activity.
 4. Stretch in opposition to the line of pull of the muscle.
 5. Use a firm but comfortable grip.182Senior Fitness

Make sure your clients stretch after regularly
scheduled strength and endurance exercis-es. If your client is unable to do endurance or strength exercises for some reason, and stretching exercises are the only kind they are able to do, make sure they do them at least three times a week, for at least twenty min-utes each session. Do each stretching exercise three to five times at each session.
# Safety
If your client has had a hip replacement, check with the doctor who did the surgery before doing lower body exercises. Clients who have had a hip replacement should not do any stretches that require them to cross their legs or bend their hips past a 90-degree angle.
Always have your client warm up before
stretching exercises. Have clients stretch after endurance or strength exercises, for example; or, if only performing stretching exercises on a particular day, do a little bit of easy walking and arm-pumping first. Stretching prior to a warm up may result in injury.
Stretching should never cause pain, espe-
cially joint pain. If stretching is painful, you FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY
are stretching the client too
far and need to reduce the stretch so that it doesn’t hurt. Mild discomfort or a mild pulling sensation is normal. Instruct your client to never “bounce” into a stretch, but to make slow, steady move-ments instead. Jerking into position can cause muscles to tighten, possibly result-ing in injury. Tell your cli-ents to avoid locking joints into place when straighten-ing them during stretches. Arms and legs should be straight when stretched, but not locked into a tightly straight position. Always make sure your client has a very small amount of bending in their joints while stretching.
# Progressing
You will know how to progress by communicating with your cli-ent, stretching should never hurt. It may feel slightly uncomfort-able, but not painful. Push your client to stretch farther, but not so far that it hurts. Maintaining Flexibility As We Age

# About Floor Exercises
Some stretches that are done on the floor stretch very important
muscle groups. If your client is afraid to lie on the floor to exercise because they fear that they won’t be able to get back up, consider using the buddy system to do some of these exercises.
Knowing the right way to get into a lying position on the floor and
the right way to get back up also may be helpful to your clients. Those people who have had a hip replacement should check with their surgeon before using the following method. The same advice goes for clients with osteoporosis—check with the doctor first.
To get into a lying position:
 1. Stand next to a very sturdy chair that won’t tip
over (put chair against wall for support if you need to). Put your hands on the seat of the chair.
 2. Lower yourself down on one knee.
 3. Bring the other knee down.
 4. Put your left hand on the floor and lean on it as you bring your left hip to the floor.
 5. Your weight is now on your left hip.
 6. Straighten your legs out.
 7. Lie on your left side.
 8. Roll onto your back.
Note: You don’t have to use your left side. Reverse positions, if you like.194Senior Fitness

# Unit Summary
 I. Since flexibility is important for safe training as well as
for the performance of routine daily activities, atten-tion to flexibility should be included in any fitness

program for older adults.
 II. An awareness of the proper conditions and techniques for stretching is key and should be conveyed to  the client.
 a. Optimal conditions for eliciting a stretch include warming up muscles before stretching, avoiding the application of too much force to the stretch, and holding the stretch for a duration of approximately thirty to sixty seconds.
 b. The two basic stretching techniques are active stretching and passive stretching.
 III. Safe stretches for older adults include specific stretches for major muscle groups as well as wrists, ankles, hips, shoulders, and neck.
 IV. Stretching should never cause pain, especially in  the joints.
 V. Clients who are nervous about doing floor stretches because they are afraid they won’t be able to get up can use the buddy system and can also be instructed in proper methods for getting into and out of a lying position on the floor.196Senior Fitness

After completing this unit you will be able to:
 • Have the basic information necessary to work
safely with individuals with cardiac and pulmo-nary conditions
 • Help individuals recovering from a cardiac event bridge the gap between rehabilitation and gen-eral fitness programming
 • Identify warning signs that indicate danger for an individual with a cardiac or pulmonary con-dition
 • Understand how exercise can influence out-come for individuals with cardiac or pulmonary conditions
When done properly and prudently,
exercise will normally have a positive outcome. Exercise is therapy for the mind and the body. However, it is the trainer’s job to make sure it is done within the standards and prac-tices recommended for older adults. It is also important to remember that the doctor’s or physical thera-pist’s protocols supercede any exer-cise program you have developed. If you have concerns or disagreements about the therapy prescribed for the client, call the doctor or physical therapist to discuss their rationales. As we said earlier, your role is to be a team player in the client’s continu-um of care.
Exercise is often prescribed for orthopedic conditions, heart health, and general health issues, and we know that many of these issues become more common, sometimes chronic, with age. In this sec-tion, we will examine some of these conditions and explore the things that every trainer needs to know when working with clients who are dealing with them. Be sure to keep in mind, though, that your client is an individual to be respected and cared for, and not just someone with a bad back or knee. Our mission is to make the client function at optimum efficiency.
This section will address working with individuals with cardiac and
pulmonary conditions, chronic conditions seen frequently in older adults. The pathology of numerous conditions will be explained, as will the ways in which exercise can influence outcome. Corrective exercises will also be explained and illustrated. Our approach will be therapeutic in nature; however, we will work from a wellness model rather than a model of sickness. 200Senior Fitness

myocardial infarction
(MI): Destruction of
heart tissue resulting from obstruction of the blood supply to the heart muscle. Commonly known as a heart attack.
angioplastie surgery:
Surgery to repair a dam-aged blood vessel or unblock a coronary artery.
bypass surgery: Surgery
that reroutes blood around clogged coronary arteries and improves the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle.CARDIOVASCULAR CONDITIONS
# Cardiac Rehabilitation
Following a major cardiac incident like a myocardial infarction
(MI) or “heart attack,” most patients will participate for twelve to thirty weeks in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Cardiac rehabil-itation programs also serve clients who have undergone cardiac surgeries to prevent major events like angioplasties and bypass surgeries from happening.
There are generally four phases of cardiac rehabilitation. The first
two stages involve acute care in the days and weeks immediately following the event or surgery. During this time the primary goals are functional abilities like sitting up, standing, walking (stop and go), and flexibility. Phases three and four include walking pro-grams of greater intensity than the previous stages and light resis-tance exercises. Once the patients have graduated to phase three or four, they approach a period where they are not quite ready to be training on their own, yet they no longer require clinical monitor-ing. During this time physicians will strongly encourage their older clients to continue participating in an outside exercise program to further the gains that have been made in rehabilitation and to pre-vent any further cardiac incidents from occurring.
As a fitness professional, you can bridge the gap between rehabili-
tation and general fitness programming. Working with physicians and therapists, you can play a significant role in providing life-en-hancing activity programs to those people who have experienced cardiac difficulties. Exercise plays a key role in the return to a normal lifestyle following a heart attack, angioplasty, bypass sur-gery, or other trauma to the heart. The continued progress made through “after care” exercise programs has been shown to reduce the rate of subsequent cardiac events and improve quality of life.Chronic Conditions I: Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Conditions
# Unit 14 201
Indicated Exercise Program
In addition to any specific recommendations the physician or ther-
apist has made, regular participation in cardiovascular exercise is a must. Consistency is essential in cardiovascular workouts. Your client should do aerobic activity for at least fifteen to twenty min-utes, three times a week. Be sure to start with whatever the client can comfortably do and work up to this min-imum. As physical condition improves, consider gradually increasing the workouts to thirty to sixty minutes five or more times a week.
The type of cardiovascular
activity that will be chosen depends on your client’s per-sonal preferences and the options available. Walking is a popular low impact activ-ity to start with, especially for those people who have not been active. Cycling and water exercise programs are equally as effective in getting the heart working and are also excellent low impact choices.
Strength training is another component that should be added to
the exercise program. Light dumbbells and resistance bands can be used to develop major muscle groups until the client is ready to begin work on strength-training machines and heavier free weights. Two to three days per week of resistance training is rec-ommended for optimum gains. As the client progresses, you can work them up to eight to ten strength sessions for two to four sets of eight to twelve repetitions.202Senior Fitness

# Hypertension
Many adults have high blood pressure. It is believed that hyper-
tension is the third most common chronic condition in the United States, right behind sinusitis and arthritis. Generally, people with high blood pressure will get cardiovascular disease after sixty-five years of age. Normal blood pressure is considered a measurement (in millimeters of mercury) of 120mmHg/80mmHg or lower. Hypertension is characterized by resting blood pressure measur-ing greater than 140mmHg systolic and/or 90mmHg diastolic. Although both measurements may be elevated, having one or the other elevated still classifies as hypertension. Elevated blood pressure is characterized as increased pressure against the arterial wall during heart contraction (systole) and during heart relaxation (diastole). Medical experts diagnose 90 percent of hypertension as coming from an unknown cause. Speculations have been made about possible causes ranging from excess sodium intake to elevat-ed stress levels. Hypertension is usually characterized in stages as shown in Table 14-1.hypertension: Persistent

Participation in regular exercise can help to bring blood pressure
levels back within the normal range. The level or intensity of exer-cise at which you will train your client will vary depending on their level of hypertension and their physician’s recommendation. For stage one hypertensives, low intensity cardiovascular training may Source: National High Blood Pressure Education Program
be used to alleviate high blood pressure, often without the client’s
having to be placed on medication. Both cardiovascular and resis-tance training may be used with this client, paying special attention to keeping the resistance low and the repetitions high. Only those stage one hypertensives that are borderline or have their hyperten-sion under control should participate in resistance/weight training. Be aware that at this stage, more people are taking prescription medications. Blood pressure medications can influence resting and exercise heart rate levels, so be sure to keep informed of any and all medications your client is taking. Exercise is generally not recom-mended in the treatment plan for stage three hypertensives due to the sensitive nature of the condition.
Contraindications
 1.  Avoid training when your client has a resting systol-
ic BP >175mmHg unless you have the physician’s consent.
 2. Avoid heavy resistance training.
 3. Instruct the client to avoid holding his or her breath, as that increases blood pressure.
Precautions
 1.  Emphasize warm-up and stretching portions of the workout and include a prolonged cool-down ses-sion.
 2. Never have clients stop suddenly; always keep them moving after vigorous exercise until heart rate is close to their pre-exercising resting level.
 3. Focus on exhaling with each repetition of an exer-cise
 4. Exercising with light weights may be acceptable, but check with the physician before starting. Emphasize muscular endurance versus strength. Strive to perform a minimum of ten to fifteen repe-titions of each exercise with a lighter weight.
 5. Concentrate more of the program on lower-ex-tremity exercises. Upper body work is good, but pressing too much weight overhead tends to ele

hyperlipidemia:  Higher
than normal fat and cho-
lesterol levels in the blood

(cholesterol).
high-density lipoprotein
(HDL): A type of lipopro-tein that seems to provide protection against the buildup of atherosclerotic fat deposits in the arteries. Exercise seems to increase the HDL fraction of total cholesterol. HDL contains high levels of protein and low levels of triglycerides and cholesterol.
low-density lipopro-
tein (LDL): A lipoprotein
carrying a high level of cholesterol, moderate levels of protein and low levels of triglycerides. Associated with the building of other sclerotic deposits in the arteries. HYPERLIPIDEMIA
Hyperlipidemia (also sometimes referred to as hypercholester-
olemia) is another way of saying high cholesterol. Elevated blood plasma cholesterol levels can lead to chronic medical problems. Total blood cholesterol levels are ideal when they stay below 180mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter of blood). When the total blood cholesterol level rises above 240 mg/dl a person is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. High-density lipoproteins (HDL’s) actually have
a protective effect against coronary artery disease; a level >65mg/dl is considered good even when total cholesterol is slightly elevated. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL’s) are the end product of triglycer-ide metabolism and are considered the bad guys in the cholesterol group. An LDL level of <100mg/dl is considered good or “low risk.”206Senior Fitness

Indication for Exercise
Exercise can help to alleviate hyperlipidemia by increasing blood
plasma levels of HDL’s, the good cholesterol. Recommendations from experts in the field include participating in an exercise pro-gram in conjunction with a reducing dietary fat. There are some people who eat very little dietary fat and foods containing choles-terol but still have hyperlipidemia; however, this is not the norm.
Contraindications
 1. Those people who are significantly deconditioned
should consult a physician prior to beginning an exercise program.
 2. Anyone using a medication that would significantly
decrease exercise capacity should consult a physi-cian prior to beginning an exercise program.
Importance
 1. Reduces blood plasma cholesterol without the use
of drugs.
 2. Improves dietary habits.
 3. Increases exercise capacity.
 4. Reduces risk of chronic diseases associated with hyperlipidemia.
When to Exercise
 1.  Three to five days per week.
 2. When no illness is present.
 3. When exercise can be performed without causing undue fatigue.
 4. At a time of day that is convenient and will pro-mote regular participation.
Precautions
 1.  Stop smoking.
 2. Lose excess body fat and reduce dietary fat.
 3. Limit alcohol intake.
 4. Always consult a physician.Chronic Conditions I: Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Conditions
# Unit 14 207

peripheral vascular dis-
ease (PVD): Also known as peripheral artery disease (PAD) or peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD), includes all diseases caused by the obstruction of large arteries in the arms and legs. PVD can result from atherosclerosis, inflam-matory processes leading to stenosis, an embolism, or thrombus formation. It causes either acute or chronic ischemia (lack of blood supply), typically of the legs.
lactic acid: A by-product
of glucose and glycogen metabolism in anaerobic muscle energetics. A min-ute accumulation
causes muscular fatigue and pain, and retards contraction. Lactic acid is carried by the blood to the liver, where it is reconvert-ed to glucose and returned as blood glucose to the muscles. It is this eleva-tion of blood lactic acid in sustained strenuous exer-cise, such as in marathon running, which results in muscle fatigue and pain. Recovery follows when enough oxygen gets to the muscle, part of the lactic acid being oxidized and most of it then being
built up once more into glycogen. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common name shared by
a collection of vascular problems that involve an atherosclerotic narrowing of the vessels. PVD usually involves the occlusion or blockage of large to medium sized arteries of the lower extremities by hardened fatty plaques. PVD is usually associated with other chronic conditions like high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) or hypertension. Most people with PVD will experience pain during exercise as a result of inadequate blood flow or ischemia. The damage to the ves-sels prevents the necessary amount of oxygen from being delivered to the working muscle. The muscular ischemia results in a painful cramping sensation or claudication in the calves during activity with the feeling subsiding when the activity is stopped. The lack of oxy-gen leads to excessive accumulation of lactic acid and other waste products in the muscle. This is what causes the pain. If the exercise is continued, the build up can eventually cause shortness of breath. If the disease progresses, so does the severity of the symptoms. The complete obstruction of blood flow in an affected vessel can lead to necrosis (death) of the tissues supplied by that vessel.
Indications for Exercise
Although medication and surgery are common treatments for PVD, exercise is recommended to help improve functional change. Most physicians and therapists recommend weight-bearing cardiovascular exercise. Weight bearing exercise may not be tolerated well by some clients with advanced disease, so non-weight bearing exercise can be used to develop some conditioning and tolerance. A progressive pro-gram will eventually ease the client into weight bearing exercise. Always obtain physician’s concent prior to beginning an exercise program.
Interval training (e.g., alternating two-minute walks with one-min-
ute rests), swimming, stationary cycling, walking on a slow tread-mill at one mph, and chair exercises are all options for persons with PVD. Those who are unable to use the lower extremities due to PVD and claudication can perform chair exercises or upper body exercises; recumbent and non-weight-bearing activities are also good choices. In terms of aerobic activity, a clinical recommenda-208Senior Fitness
tion is for the participant to establish an exercise intensity that is
balanced between his or her target heart rate and moderate discom-fort or pain from which the person’s attention can be diverted by a number of stimuli such as conversation. This level of discomfort is classified as “Grade II.” (See Table 14-3) If a participant cannot achieve the minimum target heart rate because it elicits discomfort above Grade II, then lower the target heart rate until Grade II dis-comfort is achieved. Discontinue any exercise that provokes pain at Grade III or above (intense pain from which the person’s attention cannot be diverted except by catastrophic events).
Training should be performed in intervals, alternating periods of
exercise and periods of rest. An optimal training program of five days per week, maintaining twenty to thirty minutes of cardiovas-cular exercise should be the goal. The intensity and duration of the exercise periods can be increased as the client’s tolerance level increases. It is useful to use a subjective pain-rating scale like Table 14-3 to help patients rate their pain and become more in tune with their condition. Remember that clients should never be allowed to work beyond a Grade II.Chronic Conditions I: Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Conditions

 3. Do not train without a physician’s consent.
chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD): Refers to chronic bronchitis and emphysema, a pair of two commonly co-existing diseases of the lungs in which the airways become narrowed. This leads to a limitation of the flow of air to and from the lungs caus-ing shortness of breath.Importance of Exercise
 1.  Improves peripheral circulation without medica-tion.

 2. Improves tolerance to pain.
 3. Improves muscle metabolism and oxygen  utilization.
When to exercise
 1.  At least five days a week is the goal.
 2. When no signs or symptoms of severe occlusion are present.
 3. When medication can be avoided by participation.
 4. At a time of day that is convenient and will pro-mote regular participation.
Precautions
 1.  Most people with PVD also have a high prevalence of heart disease. Watch for signs and symptoms during exercise.
 2. Clients with PVD may experience an abnormal rise in blood pressure due to the compromised vessels.
# Pulmonary Conditions
# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a term utilized
for both chronic bronchitis and emphysema since most persons will exhibit characteristics of both bronchitis (airway disease) and emphysema (alveolar disease). Chronic bronchitis is generally defined as a condition where a cough develops as a result of an over-secretion of mucus and difficulty expelling air. The overpro-duction of mucus that narrows the airways is caused by chronic irritation of the airways. The most common irritant is cigarette 210Senior Fitness
smoke. Air pollution, secondhand smoke, and exposure to occu-
pational hazardous materials/dusts are among other common irritants. Emphysema is characterized by the abnormal and perma-nent enlargement of air spaces due in part to the destruction of the alveolar walls. The structural damage causes the walls to collapse on exhalation, which leads to the obstruction of airflow.
COPD is diagnosed by pulmonary function testing. The measure-
ment of FEV1, the amount of total lung volume that can be forcibly exhaled in one second, should be above 65 percent. A value that falls below this level is considered a positive diagnosis.

# Asthma
Asthma is classified as a reversible (spontaneously or therapeuti-
cally) obstructive airway disease, resulting in the sudden onset of muscle spasms, swelling, and the presence of mucous in the tra-cheobronchial tree. It is caused by a hyperirritability to a variety of stimuli, such as inhalants, ingestants, environment, and exercise. Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is brought on by sustained exercise such as running or bicycling for longer than six minutes.212Senior Fitness
Symptoms of Asthma

# Neurological Disorders
# The Organization Of The Brain
In order to understand a client with a brain injury, it is critical
to understand the basic functional components of the brain. The brain is the control board for all of the body’s functions, including thinking, moving, and breathing. It receives messages, interprets them, and then responds to them by enabling the person to speak, move, or show emotion.
The brain is protected by a thick layer of bone (the skull) and is
surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid that allows the brain to “float” slightly within the skull. This fluid also fills the open areas within the brain (the ventricles).
The brain is comprised of the following:
 • Cortex - most thinking functions occur
 • Cerebellum - coordinates movement
 • Brain Stem - controls consciousness, alertness, and
basic bodily functions such as breathing, respira-tion, and pulse.
The cortex is the largest part of the brain and is divided into four
“lobes,” each of which specializes in particular functions and skills.
 • Frontal lobe - emotional control, motivation,
social functioning, expressive language, inhibi
-
tion of impulses, motor integration, and voluntary movement.
 • Temporal lobe - memory, reception, language, sequencing, and musical awareness.
 • Parietal lobe - sensation, academic skills such as reading, and awareness of spatial relationships.
 • Occipital lobe - visual perception.218Senior Fitness
The cortex is divided into two hemispheres.
The dominant hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere) controls verbal functions includ-ing speaking, writing, reading, and calculating. The right hemisphere generally controls func-tions that are more visual-spatial in nature like visual memory, copying, drawing, and rhythm.
Individuals with head injuries often show
changes in personality and emotional control regardless of which side the injury occurred.
# Acquired Brain Injury
One of the most challenging aspects of being a fitness educator of older adults is addressing neurologic dysfunction. The focus of this sec-tion will be on Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). Very few disabilities present the vast combi-nation of cognitive, physical, psychosocial, and emotional problems that ABI does. ABI is a fancy term that means that the individual suffered an injury to the brain from either an internal or external source and that this insult to the brain occurred after maturation. As you can imagine, the causes are numerous and varied.
Causes of ABI
Some of the most common causes are (1) head injury from a fall or accident, and (2) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) which in every-day language means “a stroke.” Other common causes include drug overdoses, brain tumors, and hypoxia (a deficiency of oxygen in the tissues). While it is important to understand the cause and pathology of ABI, it is critical to understand that damage to the parietal lobe of the brain will be the same regardless of the cause. If you plan to work with the ABI individuals, it would be wise to study the basics of brain pathology. (The textbook, Adapted Physical Education for Adults with Disabilities, contains a useful section on ABI by Lasko/Knopf; for more information, call FEOAA.).Chronic Conditions II: Neurological and Metabolic Conditions

Definition of Acquired Brain Injury
An acquired impairment of brain function resulting in the loss of
cognitive, motor, linguistic, psychosocial, sensory, and perceptual abilities that may display dysfunction in the following domains:
Cognitive: Impairment of memory function, attention, concentra-
tion, judgment, organizational thinking skills, spatial orientation, and information processing.
Psychomotor: Involvement of neuromotor system. Impairment of
motor tone, balance, coordination, and strength.Linguistic: Impairment of speech, language, and related commu-
nication skills.
Psychosocial: Impulsiveness, disinhibition, denial, poor social
judgment, emotional disability, initiation, and in some cases untoward social behavior.
Sensory/Perceptual: Visual, auditory, and tactile perceptual deficits.
Other disorders that are secondary to head injury are:
 1. Spasticity (flexion and extension synergies)
 2. Joint Contractures
 3. Bowel and Bladder Dysfunction
 4. Pneumonia
 5. Seizures
 6. Depression
 7. Loss of Judgment
 8. Headaches
 9. Memory Loss
 10. Impulsive Behavior220Senior Fitness
aphasia: An inability to
interpret or execute spoken language (receptive and expressive, respectively) which is not related to dis-eases of the vocal cords or ears.Many characteristics are common among persons with injuries on
the same side of the head. Damage to the right side of the brain often results in impaired perceptions and paralysis on the left side of the body (i.e., left hemiplegia). Persons with injury to the left side of the brain manifest problems in communication related to speech, comprehension, reading, writing, along with paralysis of the right side of the body.
Many times the head-injured person will suffer from aphasia.
This condition results in the inability to comprehend spoken language (receptive aphasia) and/or execute speech (expressive aphasia). These symptoms are due to a lesion in the auditory cor-tex of the brain.
Cerebral Vascular Accident (Stroke)
Strokes are the third leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the United States. Men experience strokes more fre-quently than women and more African Americans incur strokes than Caucasians do. The incidence of stroke increases dramatically with age and doubles with every decade after age 55. Because there are approximately three million people alive in the U.S. who have incurred a stroke, it is essential that fitness educators of older adults have some working knowledge of how to teach this population.
Due to the large number of clients enrolled in adaptive physical
fitness programs who have had a stroke, it is very important to understand as much as possible about this neurological disorder, and how best to assist them in regaining normal function.
A stroke occurs when a blood vessel bringing oxygen and nutri-
ents to parts of the brain bursts or becomes clogged. When that happens, the nerve cells in that part of the brain die, resulting in a disturbance to the opposite side of the body. A right-sided stroke in the brain results in left-sided paralysis, known as “hemiplegia.”Chronic Conditions II: Neurological and Metabolic Conditions
# Unit 15 221
hemiplegia: One sided
paralysis.
The nerve cells of the brain control how we receive and interpret
sensations. They also control most of our body movements. When some nerve cells in the brain cannot function, then the part of the body controlled by them cannot function either. This can result in difficulty speaking, inability to walk, loss of memory, lack of bowel or urinary control, or other symptoms. The effects of a stroke may be very slight or severe, temporary or permanent. This depends on which brain cells have been damaged, how widespread the damage is, and how quickly other areas of brain tissue take over the work of the damaged cells.
Spasticity (abnormal increases in muscle tone) interferes with the
ability to move normally. Spasticity develops insidiously a few days after the stroke has occurred and gradually replaces the initial com-plete paralysis of the muscles of the affected side of the body.
A newborn has little control over his body, and his movements
are dictated by reflexes, referred to as primitive reflexes. These reflexes are with us throughout our lives. As the brain develops, it overrides, or inhibits, these reflexes. When a person suffers brain damage, these primitive reflexes are considered abnormal when they re-emerge. Careful positioning, as well as encouragement to use the affected limbs in a functional manner throughout all daily activities, can help to prevent or inhibit spasticity (tone) and abnor-mal primitive reflexes. This will help to ensure that the likelihood of regaining normal functional movement is maximized.
Research shows that the stroke survivor can benefit from contin-
ued exercise even after his or her initial rehabilitation. Therefore, fitness educators of older adults will be seeing more and more stroke survivors in their classes and should be prepared to meet the demands of these clients. Returning to the community and to mainstream life can be difficult for survivors and family alike. Family dynamics will change. Issues arising after the return home include safety, fall prevention, health promotion, and appropriate leisure time activities. Participating in a well-designed exercise class that is therapeutic in nature can contribute greatly to the stroke survivor’s physical and mental health.222Senior Fitness
Recommendations for Exercise
Often, persons with ABI are resistant to physical activity, expecting
that it will aggravate headaches, cause dizziness, or fatigue them. Generally, exercise will not aggravate any such conditions. It is rec-ommended that the individual spend at least 30 to 60 minutes daily participating in activities that will develop muscular strength and endurance, cardiovascular endurance, balance, and coordination. Small-group activities teaching balance and range-of-motion have been found to be successful and beneficial, providing that progress is monitored regularly. The time spent partaking in exercise, swim-ming, and/or sports activities is not only valuable physically, but is also psychologically stimulating.
Goals of the Exercise Routine
A well-designed program will focus on trying to reduce contrac-tures and improve functional fitness skills. It would be prudent to improve the ABI client’s ability to perform weight shifts, in addition to maintaining balance and coordination. It is unwise to Chronic Conditions II: Neurological and Metabolic Conditions

closely
use any exercises that will increase the tightness of an already tight
muscle. It would be far better to work the opposing muscle groups and stress range of motion.
Water is a great place to work on recuperating skills
  –if the client is
supervised. Place a small swim fin on the foot of the affected side;
to increase feedback to the brain.
Flexibility: Activity is
important to maintain joint flexibility.
Range-of-motion exercises that were prescribed by the client’s
physical or occupational therapist for ankle, hamstring, hip, shoul-der, wrist, and hand flexibility are critical and should be performed according to a prescribed schedule.
Muscular Strength: This area is still controversial, depending on
the physical therapist’s frame of reference. Some therapists who utilize the Bobath approach maintain that strength training caus-es spasms and contractures. Other therapists believe that in order to maintain greater independence, one must develop enough strength to meet the demands of daily living. Any loss of muscle strength will manifest itself in a greater loss of functional ability. (Always consult the client’s physician and physical therapist). If your client notices loss of flexibility, either decrease the amount of strength training (if indicated), or spend more time participat-ing in stretching, range-of-motion activities. Also, be mindful of increases in blood pressure!
Balance/Coordination: For persons with a head injury, a signifi-
cant portion of time should be devoted to safe and functional bal-
ance activities. Always make sure your clients are safe when doing balance exercises.
Cardiovascular Exercise: This activity is not only useful to increase
aerobic capacity; it helps maintain proper blood pressure. Aerobic exercise also encourages reciprocal movements of the arms and legs, which helps coordination. Always consult the client’s phy-sician prior to incorporating aerobic exercise and ask for specific guidelines relevant to work load, intensity, and training heart rates.224Senior Fitness
Parkinson’s Disease: A
degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the suf-ferer’s motor skills, speech, and other functions.PARKINSON’S DISEASE
Parkinson’s Disease usually occurs between the ages of 40 to 80.
Parkinson’s is caused by damage to specific regions of the brain. Symptoms appear over a period of months to years. Parkinson’s Disease affects motor function but not cognitive abilities. The pri-mary characteristics include:
 • Muscle rigidity and weakness
 • Gait/walking changes, as seen in shuffling
 • Posture change, as witnessed by hunched-over
posture
 • Hand tremors, present at rest
Exercise is very helpful for persons with Parkinson’s Disease.
Exercise not only improves their physical health, it improves their emotional health. Exercise allows them to feel good about the fact that they are actively having a positive influence on the disease. Exercise allows people to gain self-esteem, which may lead to expanding social contacts. Many communities have Parkinson’s support groups that provide exercise classes specifically designed for persons with the disease.Chronic Conditions II: Neurological and Metabolic Conditions
# Unit 15 225

Indicated Exercise Program
 • Emphasis should be placed on stretching the tight
muscles.
 • Focus should be placed on mild strength-training exercises done slowly and under control, facilitating coordination and strength.
 • Always do each exercise through the complete
range of motion to keep the joint supple.
 • Work on breathing exercises to keep lungs as healthy as possible.
 • A well-designed and supervised water exercise pro-gram can be helpful. Look for a class where the water is as warm as possible to encourage flexibility
and reduce spasticity.
Exercise Precautions
 • Do not allow the client to become fatigued. Teach
clients to start slowly and listen to their bodies. It is OK to back off if necessary.
 • Work closely with the client’s physical therapist and
physician regarding the exercise plan.226Senior Fitness

# Metabolic Disorders
# Diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease in which the body is
unable to use food properly. It is caused by an insufficient supply of insulin. Insulin is produced in the pancreas. The function of insulin is to regulate the rate at which the body uses or stores sugar. Much of the food we eat is converted into a form of sugar called glucose or stored as glycogen. Glycogen is stored in the liver and muscles and may be broken down into glucose when needed. Insulin is needed by the body to burn glucose, which provides energy for the muscles. If the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin, glucose cannot be used by the muscles or stored, so glucose accumulates in the bloodstream and causes blood sugar levels to rise above normal. Two signs of diabetes are excessive amounts of sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) and excretion of sugar in the urine (glycosuria).Chronic Conditions II: Neurological and Metabolic Conditions
# Unit 15 229
diabetes mellitus: A
group of disorders of
the body’s carbohydrate (sugar) metabolism charac-terized by elevated blood glucose (blood sugar) levels and glucose in the urine resulting from inadequate production or use of insulin (eg hyperglycemia).
The symptoms of diabetes are related to the increased amount of
sugar in the blood. Diabetes may be without symptoms; such may be the case with elderly weakness. Other symptoms include pain, numbness, tingling in the hands and feet, disturbances in vision, irri-tability, and nervousness. In children, the classic symptoms manifest themselves, as weight loss, polyuria, polydipsia, and fatigue.
There are two types of diabetes mellitus: Type I and Type II. Type
I is insulin-dependent diabetes (formerly called juvenile diabetes), where the body’s immune system destroys insulin-producing cells, and insulin needs to be injected into the bloodstream.
Type II is known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes (formerly
called adult-onset diabetes), where the body does not produce enough insulin. Type II diabetes is the type you will encounter most frequently in older adults. With Type II, diet, exercise, and oral medications usually work well, so insulin injections are not needed to control blood glucose levels.  230Senior Fitness

Regular exercise can help a person with Type II diabetes to stabilize
the condition by losing excess fat and weight, decreasing the need for insulin, lowering cholesterol, and avoiding further complica-tions. Always consult your client’s physician for specific recom-mendations and precautions relevant to his or her condition.
Diabetes can lead to:
 1. Cardiovascular Disorders: A person with diabetes
is two times more likely to develop Coronary

Artery Disease.
 2. Macrovascular Disease: Diabetes contributes to  the development of vascular problems requiring amputation.
 3. Microvascular Disease: Diabetic retinopathy results when tiny blood vessels in the retina break and cause little hemorrhages on or near the retina. (See Unit 17 for more on diabetic retinopathy.) Cataracts also seem to be more prevalent in per-sons with diabetes.
 4. Neuropathy: Destruction of nerves caused by excessive blood glucose and poor blood supply. (See Unit 17 for more on neuropathy.)
 5. Diabetic Nephropathy: Chronically high blood sugar overworks the kidneys and causes them to stop working properly.
# Treatment
Diabetes cannot be cured, but can be controlled. Treatment may
include medication (insulin), daily exercise, and diet therapy. Exercise in consistent amounts is very important in managing Type II diabetes. Blood glucose levels should be checked prior to exercise to determine any adjustments in food intake. If blood sugar levels are 300 mg or greater, do not begin exercise. Table 15-2 summarizes guidelines for adjusting food intake according to blood sugar levels. This table is for reference only.

# Exercise Guidelines For Diabetics
 • Consult with physician to determine the correct level of
insulin for when exercising
 • Persons who experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or too much insulin in the blood should have easily digestible carbohydrates (orange juice, for example) available at all times
 • Exercise at predictable times to minimize blood sugar fluctuation
 • Exercise heart rates should be between 50% and 70% of maximum heart rate
 • Don’t exercise on an empty stomach
 • Drink plenty of fluids
 • Always warm up and cool down
 • If client exercises on his or her own, encourage exercise with a buddy
 • See Unit 17 for considerations on diabetic retinopathy

UNIT SUMMARYExercise with Renal Nephropathy
Because of the many complications of diabetes and renal disease,
thorough screening prior to the initiation of an exercise program is essential. No exercise program should begin until the person is sta-bilized on a therapeutic program of medication, dialysis, and diet. Individuals on hemodialysis benefit from aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, cycling, and swimming. The program should begin gradually due to the likelihood of anemia, cardiovascular dysfunc-tion, and low physical work capacity, using an interval training program (five minutes work, five minutes rest). Intensity of exer-cise should range from 60 to 80 percent of the person’s maximum heart rate. Fluid replacement is warranted if exercise is performed in heat or following dialysis treatment.
 I.  The most common causes of ABI are (1) head injury from
a fall or accident, and (2) cerebrovascular accident (CVA) also known as a stroke.
a.
 Research shows that the stroke survivor can benefit
from continued exercise even after his or her initial rehabilitation. Therefore, fitness educators of older adults will be seeing more and more stroke survivors in their classes or appointment books and should be pre-pared to meet the demands of these clients.
b.
 It is recommended that the individual spend at least 30 to 60 minutes daily participating in activities that will develop muscular strength and endurance, car-diovascular endurance, balance, and coordination. A well-designed program will focus on trying to reduce contractures and improve functional fitness skills.
c.
 The water is a great place to work on recuperating skills

# Arthritis
Arthritis is one of the most common conditions that you will encounter while working with an older clientele. More than 36 mil-lion people in the United States have some form of arthritis. Arthritis
literally means inflammation of
a joint. The term arthritis is used to describe over one hun-dred joint/connective tissue disorders. Several of the most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout. Sometimes fibromyalgia is also listed as an arthritic condition.
# Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is caused by the breakdown of the smooth hya-line cartilage inside the joint. Without a smooth articulating
surface movement in or about the joint, movement becomes pain-ful. Osteoarthritis is commonly referred to as the wear-and-tear arthritis because it is frequently seen in the weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, ankles, and spine. The prognosis is usually good; the condition progresses slowly and usually is not crip-pling. The use of medications and gentle exercise is very helpful. (Osteoarthritis is a less severe inflammatory condition than rheu-matoid arthritis.)
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA)
Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune condition. RA often begins before the age of forty. Symptoms include fatigue, tenderness on or around joints, inflammation, pain, stiffness, and swelling. This condition follows an unpredictable course of exac-erbations and remissions. Many persons with RA notice a loss in appetite, sometimes fever, and the development of rheumatoid nodules under the skin. This condition entails much more than simple joint pain; it is much more like a chronic illness.238Senior Fitness

uric acid: A byproduct
of the purine metabolism
which in its turn is a prod-uct of nucleic acid break-down. The majority of uric acid is synthesized in the liver. Elevated levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia) and its salts are associated with formation of urate crystals causing gout and kidney stones.GOUT
Gout is caused by a metabolic disorder that allows uric acid to
accumulate in the blood. Crystals of uric acid are deposited within the joints, causing inflammation. The most common site is the big toe, but other joints can be affected. Gout is very painful. People used to believe that only the affluent, like kings and queens, suf-fered from this condition; unfortunately, that is simply not true.
No matter what type of arthritis your client has, one of the major
problems is combating the chronic pain cycle. When moving a joint causes pain, there is a tendency to not move the joint. This causes more stiffness and weakness, which ultimately leads to less ability and desire to move and, consequently, more disability. This downward cycle must be broken, and sensible exercise is a major component in reversing it. Today, most enlightened therapists and doctors recognize the importance of sensible and regular exercise in the care of arthritis. Research now shows that if you can increase the strength of muscles around the affected joint, these muscles will aid in supporting the load placed on that joint.Chronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions

Reasons Exercise Is Important for People
with Arthritis
 • Increases strength and flexibility around joints
 • Helps maintain or increase bone strength
 • Provides nourishment and lubrication to joints
 • Prevents disuse syndrome
 • Provides feelings of control and self-worth
How Often and When Should Exercise  Be Performed?
 • On a daily basis
 • When there is the least amount of pain and  stiffness
 • When the individual is least tired
 • When the individual receives the maximum benefit from medications during the day (generally 10:00 to 11:00 a.m.). However, instruct client not to over-medicate to mask pain.
Important: Prepare for exercise by thermally warming up the
body: use massage, a heating pad, a warm shower, or gentle rhyth-
mic movements.
Precautions
 • Find out what type of arthritis the client has.
 • Minimize stress to joints. Learn about appropriate
activities such as swimming, water exercise, and walking.
 • Avoid vigorously exercising an inflamed joint; rather, gently put the joint through its range of motion.
 • Do not allow the client to increase medications without his or her physician’s approval.240Senior Fitness
 • Have client wear warm clothes and peel off layers.
 • Modify the exercise routine depending on how the
client feels.
Contraindications
 • Avoid positions of extreme weight-bearing flexion or hyperextension.
 • Avoid jarring movements or quick directional changes.
 • Never exercise a “hot” joint—a joint that is actively inflamed and causing severe pain.
 • Never allow client to mask pain with medication.
Indicated Exercise Program
For persons with osteoarthritis, proper body weight is paramount.
Obesity accelerates the damage to diseased weight-bearing joints; thus a program of walking, water exercise, or mild stationary biking, in combination with limiting the intake of food can help facilitate the goal of losing weight. Be sure to teach proper body mechanics. Researchers, therapists, and doctors now realize that exercise plays an important role in the health of people with arthri-tis, and as trainers our job is to help our clients get the greatest benefit possible from their training.
The Goals of an Exercise Program for
People with Arthritis Should Include:
 • Using non-weight-bearing activities like swimming,
water exercise, chair series, and stationary biking
 • Always doing a thermal warm-up for five to ten minutes prior to exercising, and always stretching at the end of the program for five to ten minutes
 • Doing exercises that improve functional fitness, e.g., chair squat/leg curb squats
 • Not “making” pain. Always follow sound biome-chanical techniques, and encourage the client to listen to his or her body. If it hurts, don’t quit; just back off!Chronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 241
FIBROMYALGIA SYNDROME (FMS)
FMS is a chronic and often disabling condition, characterized by
widespread body pain and severe fatigue. Many times it is accom-panied by other problems such as irritable bowel, headache, and sleep difficulties. Other conditions that many times are grouped into this same category are chronic fatigue syndrome and myofasical pain. Persons with fibromyalgia suffer from chronic pain that is often very debilitating. A person suffer-ing from chronic pain not only suffers from the pain itself, but also suffers psycho-logically. Loss of self-esteem, which leads to depression and isolation, often triggers more pain that leads to further dis-ability; a vicious downward spiral of pain and disability can be the result.
# Chronic Pain Cycle
For exercise to be effective for persons with chronic muscle pain, these persons must first recognize that proper exercise is critical to maintaining the strength and mobility that will allow them to func-tion more fully. As good as that sounds, a person with chronic pain is often afraid to exercise, for fear that the pain will be exacerbated. The first key to a sensible exercise program is to start very, very slowly! If the person can do minimal exercise without significantly increasing the pain level, that is real progress.
Indicated Exercise Program for FMS
 • A person with any chronic painful condition must
be active in his or her own care. The more time and effort clients take to learn how they react to exercise, the better will be their progress. Clients 242Senior Fitness

need to learn to listen to their body and heed what
it says.
 • Learning and maintaining proper body mechanics is key. Using proper body mechanics while per-forming activities will help to prevent further pain.
 • Learning to relax periodically throughout the day is also important. This will help to break the cycle of muscle tension that often increases the pain level.
 • The individual should stretch often to keep muscles supple and flexible.
 • An effort should be made to increase the client’s aerobic fitness. Use low- or no-impact activities such as walking or even strolling at first, and then increase the pace, as the person feels bet-ter. Stationary biking is useful—many people like recumbent bikes because they can sit and be more comfortable. Swimming and water exercise are also good ways to get fit! (Try to find a warm therapeu
-
tic pool). Always stretch after the exercise session.
 • Encourage the client to learn techniques to man-age pain such as heat, ice, or whirlpool baths. Therapists may employ such things as electrical stimulation and ultrasound. The client should not purchase over-the-counter devices without the physician’s approval, however.
 • Make staying as fit as possible the goal. Research shows that conditioning muscles through mild to moderate aerobic exercise improves the symptoms of FMS. Of course, start very slowly! Start with a one- to three-minute walk followed by one to three minutes of stretching. If the pain is tolerable, then add two to five minutes each week of additional walking and continue to progress slowly until you can do three bouts of ten minutes, with the goal of thirty minutes of non-stop walking.
 • Set clients up to be successful. Establish goals that they can achieve, and when they surpass them, it will improve their self-esteem.
 • Don’t ever overdo it!
 • Don’t mask pain with pills and drugs.Chronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 243
# Neck Problems
Many adults experience a loss in flexibility of the neck as they
age. Often, neck pain is the result of poor body mechanics when seated or lying. Other neck problems result from arthritis of the upper spine or disc problems. Home exercise programs are a crit-ical component for persons with cervical strains and other mus-culoskeletal conditions of the neck. Many times a conservative approach of exercises and improved body mechanics, along with heat packs and recommendations from the client’s physician can result in significant improvement.
Contraindications
People with neck problems should avoid movements that hyper-extend the neck and thus aggravate neck problems that can further cause impingement of the neck arteries that supply blood to the brain. Reduced blood flow to the brain can result in serious med-ical problems.
Activities to Avoid
 • Fast or jerky neck movements—never do these!
 • Sitting with head too far forward
 • Lying down on the sofa or bed with head propped
up high on a pillow
 • Head circles
Recommendations
 • Always follow the physician’s advice
 • Try doing gentle range-of-motion exercises in  the shower or with warm, moist towels around

the neck
 • Start very, very slowly
 • When sitting, sit up straight periodically or get up and walk around
 • Always avoid the “turtleneck” position where the head is forward244Senior Fitness
Indicated Exercise Program
 • Turn head left to right
 • Empire State Building Watch —look up and
down
 • Shoulder Blade Squeeze —pull shoulder blades
together and hold and repeat
 • Head tilts —tilt head from left to right
 • Shrug shoulders and make circles backwardsChronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 245

# Low Back Problems
If you live long enough, you are likely to suffer from some form
of back problem. Over 80 percent of Americans have experienced backache. Back problems rank second to the common cold for time loss from work.
Dr. Herring of the Puget Sound Sports & Rehabilitative Center
believes that only about 1 percent of patients with back problems require surgery. For the other 99 percent of us with chronic low-er-back problems, this means that sensible exercise and proper body mechanics could lessen our pain. A person who has had a backache is ten times more likely to have another episode. Therefore, an exercise program that includes flexibility exercises, general overall conditioning, and abdominal strengthening, along with condition-ing of the muscles that stabilize the low-back area, is critical.
There are many causes of back pain, from tumors and disc ruptures
to poor body mechanics to facet joint problems, not to mention muscle spasms. Before starting any exercise program, it is wise to consult the client’s physician for a proper diagnosis and specific exercise recommendations. If the client experiences leg pain and backache, along with the following, see a physician immediately:
 • High fever
 • Loss of bowel and bladder function
 • Rapid weight loss
 • Back pain lasting more than three days
 • Numbness in the pelvis and extreme weakness in
the leg
A sound exercise program is designed to provide support and
strength to the spine and to develop a better awareness of proper body mechanics. Trunk stabilization is essential for preventing injury to the lower back while performing any movement or daily activity. Many of these exercises are also suggested for any person who is recovering from a back injury. Always begin these exercis-246Senior Fitness
es slowly and carefully, e.g., begin by holding for a count of five,
allowing the muscles to loosen up gradually. Don’t be alarmed if the exercises cause some mild discomfort, which lasts a few min-utes. However, stop doing any exercise that causes pain until you have checked with your doctor.
Common Sense Ways to Reduce Back Pain
 • Make sure home and car are set up to minimize
further pain
 • Have knees higher than hips when sitting
 • Move driver’s seat closer to steering wheel
 • Tighten abdominal muscles whenever you are about to lift anything
 • Use leg muscles when lifting by bending the knees. Keep the object close to the body. If you must bend to reach the object, bend at the hip joint.
 • Do flexibility exercises daily
 • Do back exercises regularly
 • Never twist forcefully
 • Push, don’t pull—better yet, ask for help!
 • Strengthen core muscles of torso
Tips for Proper Standing
 • Stand with weight evenly distributed over left and right foot
 • Stand with weight evenly distributed over front and back of feet
 • Keep the ears over the shoulders and chin parallel to floor
 • Keep knees soft (do not lock knees)
 • Keep abs and glutes firm to support the low backChronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 247
# Shoulder Problems
The design of the shoulder is remarkable: it allows baseball pitchers
to throw baseballs at 90 mph, it allows us to reach and grab things high or low, as well as to hug our loved ones. Shoulder problems can be the result of many different causes, such as osteoarthritis, trauma, bursitis, tendinitis, or may even be idiopathic (i.e., having no known cause). Many times the corrective exercises are the same, regardless of the cause. Prior to doing these exercises, make sure that the physician has approved them.
# The Rotator Cuff
The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint much like the hip joint, except that the hip joint is a much deeper joint and thereby pro-vides a lot more support (although with more limited mobility.) The shoulder joint is a flatter and smaller joint. If you can visualize a golf tee with a golf ball on it, you begin to sense the design of the shoulder joint. While this design affords us a great deal of move-ment, we pay the price for it with a joint that is at risk for misuse and abuse. Spring is the time of year you begin to hear a lot about shoulder problems—baseball is in full swing (pun intended), folks are returning to lap swimming, and recreational tennis players are doing all those overhead smashes.
Some experts believe that when you move your arm, as many as twenty-six muscles are engaged in the movement. Go to any gym and you will see men and women doing all kinds of over-head presses to build up the “show” muscles. However, they often neglect the very important SITS muscles. The rotator cuff musculature is made up of these SITS muscles. Research suggests that the rotator cuff muscles display the greatest electrical activity during the eccentric phase of the follow-through of major arm movements.248Senior Fitness

Causes of Rotator Cuff Injuries
Three major contributors to rotator cuff problems are described below:
 • Age: The risk for a rotator cuff injury increases with
age. Normal wear and tear, an increase in calcium
deposits within the joint, and bone spurs can irritate the rotator cuff.
 • Trauma:  An injury to the shoulder—whether it is from
a fall or any other kind of trauma—is another source of problems for the shoulder joint.
 • Overhead activities:  The outcome is likely to be the
same whether the excessive overhead activity stems from playing too much tennis or simply from lifting too many boxes. Be especially careful in water exercise classes where there are often a lot of overhead move-ments and activities that involve bringing the arms out from under the water.Chronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions

Corrective Exercises
After a trained medical professional has made a diagnosis and has
given your client permission to exercise, the following exercises might be appropriate. Many times, rest is the best thing for your client to do for the first couple of days. However, remind him or her not to allow the joint to freeze up. Six basic shoulder exercises are described below.
The V Soda Can Lift
Starting Position: Stand erect with arms alongside the body.
Movement: Then, as if holding a soda can with the thumbs facing
down, slowly lift the arms outwards as if pouring the soda on the floor. Raise the arms to the height of the shoulders with hands slightly behind the back.
Internal Rotator
Starting Position: Stand erect with the elbow bent, the elbow and upper arm against the body, and the hand straight ahead.
Movement: Then slowly allow the hand to move toward the abdo-
men. As the client improves, resistance can be added (via a hand paddle in the pool or an elastic exercise band on land).
External Rotator
Starting Position: Have the client stand as in the internal rotator exercise just described.
Movement: Assume the same basic position, except this time slow-
ly allow the hand to move outward and then return to the starting position.
Forward Cane Lift
Starting Position: Standing upright with optimal posture, use both hands to hold onto a towel or broom handle. (The towel should 250Senior Fitness
be in a horizontal position across the front of the body; the hands
should be placed a comfortable distance apart with the palms up).
Movement: Slowly lift the arms as high as possible without arching
the back or causing pain. Then return to starting position.
Rear Cane Lift
Starting Position: Standing erect, hold onto a dowel or broom han-dle behind the buttocks.
Movement: Straighten both arms and very slowly lift them as far
away from the buttocks as is possible to do comfortably.
Choker Stretch
Starting Position: Stand erect with the arms out at 90˚ angle to
the body.
Movement: Gently pull the arm across the front of the body until
a pleasant stretch is felt in the back of the arm and in the shoulder muscles. Chronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 251

# Hip Problems
The hip joint is the workhorse of the lower body, and while it is able
to move in many different directions, it is also designed for bearing weight. The hip joint is referred to as a ball-and-socket joint. The joint structure is built for stabili-ty, and it gains additional stabil-ity from the muscles positioned around it.
Hip problems are caused by
unequal leg lengths, hip mus-cle imbalances, and poor body mechanics, as well as by the cumu-lative effects of overuse, misuse, and arthritis. Many adults who have suffered from pain and dis-ability may opt for a total hip replacement after more conserva-tive approaches have failed. As with all exercises, it is prudent to always let the physician and/or physical therapist know what exer-cises you have planned and get their approval and input, especially after hip-replacement surgery.
Contraindications
 • Avoid full flexion, i.e., deep squats or pulling knee
to the chest.
 • Avoid crossing legs when exercising or moving either leg past mid-line.
Recommendations
 • Because a tight musculature is often implicated in hip problems, a gentle stretching and flexibility program would be prudent.
 • Avoid high-impact activities.
 • A well-designed water exercise program would be useful for clients with hip problems.252Senior Fitness

# Knee Problems
Knee problems are common in adults. The causes are many and
range from rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chondromalacia patellae, and joint trauma to joint replacement and reconstructive surgery of the knee. If the client is recovering from knee surgery, be sure to check with the physician to make sure that these exercises are appropriate for your client’s specific condition. If your client has been told to wear a knee brace, make sure he or she has it on when exercising.
Contraindications
 • Never go past a safe range of motion.
 • Do not use additional medication to mask the pain.
 • Do not sit with knee bent underneath you. Try to sit
with the knee almost straight whenever possible.
 • Avoid squatting, kneeling and stair climbing when-ever possible.
Recommendations
For people who have pain around the knee, it is important to keep
the thigh muscles as strong as possible.
 • Be faithful to and regular with the exercise pro-
gram and your joint will say, “Thank-you!”
 • Do gentle range-of-motion exercises within your safe range.
 • Avoid full squats.
 • Use ice when appropriate.Chronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 253

 • If pain increases significantly, speak with the client’s
physician and rest the joint until advised to  resume exercise.
 • Don’t “make” pain.
Indicated Exercise Program
 • Quad setting
 • Wall squats
 • Halfway-down chair squats
 • Closed-knee extension
 • Terminal leg extension
 • Seated leg extension (with permission)
 • Forward lunges with knee over foot
 • Leg curls
# Ankle Problems
Ankle sprains are very common. Ankle sprains occur when a
ligament connecting the bones or cartilage of the ankle is ruptured
or torn.
Factors that contribute to ankle problems are:
 • Previous injury
 • Weak or imbalanced muscles
 • Inappropriate/worn-out shoes
 • Walking on uneven surfaces
 • Being overweight
 • History of weak/unstable ankles254Senior Fitness
The two keys to improving your ankle health are:
 • Maintaining and improving range of motion

# Osteoporosis
Some of the leading causes of osteoporosis include family histo-
ry, lack of regular weight-bearing exercises, inadequate calcium and vitamin D, and low levels of estrogen following menopause. Osteoporosis is a loss of normal bone-density mass, which leads to increased porosity of the bone, which in turn makes the bone more vulnerable to fractures. Osteoporosis is more common in women, but does affect men later in life. Women who smoke and are thin and have fair complexions are more susceptible.
If you suspect that your client has osteoporosis, alert him or her
to the following:
 • Avoid all situations that could possibly lead to a fall.
 • Get rid of throw rugs and light up dark hallways to
prevent falls.
 • Quit smoking and drinking an excessive amount of soft drinks.
 • Avoid caffeine.
 • Avoid quick twisting movements.
 • Avoid poor posture when sitting, standing, and  lifting.
 • Be careful of drugs that cause you to get dizzy or that could cause you to fall.
 • Get involved in a safe exercise program, especially including weight bearing exercises
Topics for the client to discuss with the physician:
 • Discuss whether calcium supplements would  be helpful.
 • Ask if hormone replacement therapy would  be useful.
 • Find out what type of exercise is permissible.
 • Find out whether or not a bone scan is needed.256Senior Fitness
Indicated Exercise Program
 • Start a slow-walking program. If unstable, try sta-
tionary biking or using a cane while walking.
 • Strengthen the muscles of the upper back and stretch the chest muscles. A recent study showed that by doing strength and flexibility exercises, the effects of the “dowager’s hump” were diminished.
 • Swimming and water exercise are good for cardio-vascular exercise, but the verdict is still out as to whether these really increase bone density. A study at the Jewish Hospital in Israel showed that water exercise, not swimming, did improve bone density, but until more research confirms that fact, be sure to combine water exercise with regular walking to increase bone density. Be careful not to slip and fall when in the locker room or around the pool.
 • Do not bend over to lift anything. This places undue stress on the bones of the lower back. Instead, bend the knees when lifting.
 • Start doing some basic strength-training exercises.
# Amputations
Amputation refers to the loss of an upper or lower extremity. The
term includes both acquired and congenital limb losses.
Etiology
 • Trauma
 • Peripheral vascular disease
 • Diabetes
 • Frostbite
 • Chronic infection of bone
 • Tumor
 • Congenital deformity where existing limb is not
capable of functioning properlyChronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 257
The phantom limb syndrome is a frequent complaint of the person
with an amputation. This syndrome refers to the persistent aware-ness of the removed limb. This pain may occur shortly after trauma or surgery. Generally, these sensations are temporary, becoming less common once a prosthesis is applied.
Indicated Exercise Program
The initial rehabilitation program for a person with an amputation consists of training in the use of the prosthesis. For the person with a lower-extremity amputation this includes:
 • Balance activities
 • Ambulation
 • Pivoting
 • Stair climbing
 • How to fall to and rise from the ground258Senior Fitness
Table 16-2 Types of Amputations According to Site and Level of Loss
Congenital Absences
(Occurring at or before birth)Amputation Level
Amelia (terminal transverse) Shoulder Disarticulation
Hemimelia (terminal transverse) Above the elbow (AE)
Partial hemimelia Below the elbow (BE)
Acheiria (congenital absence of the hands) Wrist disarticulation; Trans-metacarpal amputation
Amelia (terminal transverse) Hip disarticulation
Hemimelia (terminal transverse) Above the knee (AK)
Partial hemimelia Below the knee (BK)
Apodi (congenital absence of feet) Syme amputation
Adactylia (congenital absence of fingers or toes) Trans-metatarsal amputation
Hemimelia denotes one-half of a limb. Amelia refers to total absence of a limb.

UNIT SUMMARYAfter this stage, the exercise treatment should develop strength and
endurance in both the impaired and normal extremities. Manual resistance would be employed for strengthening the stump.
The aerobic capacity of the person should be maintained as much
as possible. Swimming is an excellent aerobic choice. Swim fins may be attached to the stumps by special prosthesis. (If swimming, have a platform available that the person can hang onto if he or she becomes fatigued.) Arm crank ergometry may be another choice for those with limited weight-bearing capabilities. Some persons may use the leg cycle ergometer while wearing their prostheses. Chronic Conditions III: Orthopedic Conditions
# Unit 16 259
 I. Orthopedic issues come up frequently for older adults
 II. More than 36 million people in the United States have
some form of arthritis or inflammation of the joints. Some of the most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout. All of these conditions can be helped with exercise.
 a. Exercising increases strength and flexibility.
 b. Exercise provides nourishment and lubrication to joints.
 c. Exercise prevents disuse syndrome.
 III. Fitness programs for individuals with orthopedic prob-lems should follow common sense and be tailored to increase strength and flexibility while avoiding any further injury to the affected area.

Many older adults exhibit physical and sensory disabilities. The
following unit has been excerpted and edited from the textbook, Adapted Exercises for Adults with Disabilities, by Knopf and Lask. It will focus on both hearing and visual impairment. As an effective educator of older adults, it is important to understand the pathol-ogy of your clients’ special conditions. However, sometimes it can be even more important to know how to teach and convey essential information to your clients. This is ever so evident when teaching the client who has difficulty hearing or seeing you.Sensory Problems in Older Adults
# Deafness And Hearing Loss
Hearing impairment or deafness may result in loss of amplitude
(decibels) and pitch (hertz). Each individual is different. Some peo-ple lose their hearing at birth or at early age and others lose it later in life. The term “deaf” can signify different things. It can indicate that a person cannot hear speech even when amplified, or it can indicate that a person doesn’t speak and uses sign language or fin-gerspelling as their primary language.
It is estimated that 10% of the population are hearing impaired or
deaf in some form in the United States. The challenge for individ-uals who lose their hearing is adjusting to communicate in a new way. Methods of standardized sign language, fingerspelling, and lip reading allow more persons with hearing impairments to partici-pate in regular as opposed to adapted physical education programs.
Rapid technological advances in the last 30 years—including digital
hearing aids, surgical cochlear implants, and in-ear hearing aids—have allowed many people to regain some form of hearing. But even with these technologies, it is important to understand the range of frequency or sound is not the same as before. Even with advanced technology, many older adults experience an adjustment period.
# Types Of Hearing Impairment
Congenital hearing impairment refers to the medical condition’s having been present since birth. Adventitious hearing impairment refers to the condition’s having been acquired later on in life.  “Late deaf” or “deaf become” are terms commonly used for those with adventitious hearing impairments.
Conductive deafness occurs when sound waves cannot be trans-
mitted through either the outer or middle ear. The causes of this type of deafness could be the result of congenital atresia; middle ear infection due to upper respiratory infection or diseased tonsils or adenoids; childhood diseases; otitis media; or osteosclerosis. Sensorineural deafness occurs when sensory nerves of the inner ear are irreversibly damaged. A partial loss of equilibrium response is frequently associated with sensorineural hearing losses.262Senior Fitness
# Characteristics Of Persons
# With Hearing Impairments
Balance problems can be observed in people with sensorineural
(inner ear) loss. However, the person may compensate through the use of visual and kinesthetic cues. Hyperactivity is present in some, stemming from the need to maintain visual contact with all action occurring in the environment.
# Communicating With A
# Hearing Impaired Person
Before employing teaching strategies, it is important to be able to
develop a communication method with the individual. Every indi-vidual is different. Do not assume or generalize an individual’s abil-ity to understand you. You may not be aware that your client has a hearing impairment, as hearing aids can be invisible. Other clients may not even be aware they have a hearing impairment. The very best strategy is to inquire if your client has a hearing impairment and then ask how you can accommodate them.
Below are some strategies to keep in mind when communicating
with a hearing impaired or deaf person.
 1. Get the person’s attention before speaking. Make eye
contact, tap him on the shoulder, wave, turn the lights on/off, or use another visual signal.
 2. Key the person into the topic of discussion. People with hearing impairments need to know what the subject of discussion is so that they may pick up words that help them follow the conversation. This is especially important for people who depend on oral communication.
 3. Speak slowly and clearly, but do not yell, exaggerate, or over-pronounce. It is estimated that only three out of ten spoken words are visible on the lips. Exaggeration and overemphasis of words distort lip movements, mak-ing speech-reading more difficult. Try to enunciate each word, without force or tension. Short sentences are easier to understand than long ones.UNIT 17 263Sensory Problems in Older Adults
264Senior Fitness
 4. Look directly at the person when speaking. Even a
slight turn of your head can obscure their speech-read-ing view.
 5. Do not place anything in your mouth when speak-ing. Mustaches that obscure the lips, smoking, pencil chewing, and putting your hands in front of your face make it difficult for persons with hearing impairments to follow what is being said.
 6. Maintain eye contact. Eye contact conveys the feel-ing of direct communication. Even if an interpreter is present, continue to speak directly to the person with a hearing impairment. He or she will turn to the inter
-
preter as needed.
 7. Avoid standing in front of a light source, such as a window or bright light. The bright background and shadows created on the face make it almost impossi-ble to speech-read.
 8. First repeat, then try to rephrase a thought rather than again repeating the same words. If the person missed only one or two words the first time, one repetition usually will help. Particular combinations of lip move-ments sometimes are difficult for persons to speech-read. Don’t be embarrassed to communicate by paper and pencil if necessary. Getting the message across is more important than the medium used.
 9. Use gestures, body language, and facial expression to help communicate. A lively speaker is always more interesting to watch.
 10. Be courteous during conversation. If the telephone rings or someone knocks at the door, excuse yourself and tell the person that you are answering the phone or responding to the knock. Do not ignore the person and carry on a conversation with someone else while the person waits.
 11. Use open-ended questions that may be answered by more than “yes” or “no.” Do not assume that the per-son has understood your message if he or she nods in acknowledgment. Open-ended questions ensure that your information has been communicated.
Sensory Problems in Older Adults
# Unit 17 265
# Teaching Strategies
 1. Do not have the client facing the sun while you are instructing.
 2. Do not talk while facing away from person.
 3. Make eye contact before and when speaking to the person.
 4. If the client uses sign language and you know sign language, use
it.
 5. Ask if the client would prefer communication via pencil and paper.
 6. Keep hearing aid or cochlear implants away from excessive mois-ture. Many clients will need to remove their hearing aids during

exercise due to excess moisture. Ask your client ahead of time how you can best communicate during this time.
 7. Go over the exercise schedule and plan in advance (especially since many individuals will remove their hearing aids.)
 8. Use pictures and charts to reinforce demonstrations.
 9. Do not exaggerate or raise your voice when speaking to someone with a hearing aid (causes tension headaches). Use your typical

speaking voice.
 10. Assign a teammate to act as a partner and inform participant of changes in the environment during group sports and activities.
 11. Use visual cues (red flag, turn off lights) to get attention during activities.
 12. Ask clients if they have a balance dysfunction. If so, supervise climbing and apparatus work and teach principles of equilibrium:
 a. Broad base of support
 b. Lower center of gravity
 c. Use of arms out to side
 d. Falling properly
 e. Use of kneeling and sitting positions
 f. Falling outside base of support
# Indicated Exercise Program
Seniors who lose their hearing may withdraw socially from games,
dances, and group activities; thus, a fitness trainer or instructor may want to include activity choices that facilitate interaction and maintenance of social skills. Hearing loss can be a difficult to adjust to, but it need not prevent an older adult from maintaining good physical health.
# Visual Impairments
All definitions of visual impairments refer to how well the individual can see even with the best of corrective lenses. Normal vision is tech-nically referred to as 20/20. This numerical ratio is interpreted as the ability to see at twenty feet what the normal eye can see at twenty feet. A person is considered partially sighted or visually impaired if visual acuity is 20/70 or less with correction—interpreted as the ability to see at twenty feet what the normal eye can see at seventy feet. A per-son is considered legally blind if visual acuity is 20/200 or less. Total blindness is the inability to detect a bright light that is shown directly into the eye. Visual acuity is measured with a Snellen Chart (lines of letters which become smaller with each line). Over 75 percent of individuals with visual impairments in the United States have some usable vision.
Visual impairments take many forms. Some may see a tiny spot of
the visual field; but even though the spot of vision is 20/20, they may be considered legally blind. Fuzzy vision, peripheral vision, and tunnel vision make the description of visual impairment difficult to understand. The amount of light and contrasts in the environment influence visual ability in persons with impairments. For example, a person may not need a guide during daylight hours because contrasts are sufficient to permit independent movement. However, during the evening or in a dark room such as a theater, a sighted guide may be necessary because no contrasts are available. Most visually impaired individuals can perform most activities once they are oriented to the facility. Some visually impaired people swim, golf, lift weights, ride tandem bikes, etc., as long as they do not have any other issues to contend with.266Senior Fitness
Sensory Problems in Older Adults
# Unit 17 267
# Etiology
Macular Degeneration: The macula is located in the central por-
tion of the retina. Degeneration affects central vision, but the per-son maintains good peripheral vision. Usually this condition does not progress to total blindness.
Glaucoma: Excessive high pressure within the eyeball, creating
tunnel vision.
Cataracts: A clouding of the cornea. The incidence of blindness
from cataracts has decreased due to surgical techniques.
Retinitis Pigmentosa: An inherited condition in which the rod-
shaped cells in the retina degenerate. This disorder leads to total blindness.
Diabetic Retinopathy:  Because diabetes can induce vascular
changes, the retina is particularly susceptible to hemorrhage, scar-
ring, and loss of vision.
Stroke: Blindness can be caused by lack of blood supply to the visu-
al cortex located in the occipital lobe. Blindness occasionally occurs in stroke cases where the person is only capable of seeing out of one side of each eye (hemianopsia).
Refractory Errors: This includes farsightedness, nearsightedness,
and astigmatism.
Other Causes: Blindness can be a result of venereal disease, the
aging process, trauma causing detached retina, tumors, or exposure to bright light (e.g., sun, welding light).
# Characteristics
The functional ability of a person who is blind or visually impaired varies, depending upon age of onset and whether the impairment is total or partial. A person who is visually impaired or has some perception of form and light may be completely independent with full use of his or her other senses. With proper training in the use of Braille, large type books, tape recorders, new technological
equipment, and good mobility skills, individuals who are blind
can be as functionally independent as their community will allow. Individuals who have been totally blind since birth do not have any visual memory and therefore learn to use their intact senses to perceive what others see. Some individuals with visual impairments may display mannerisms such as eye-poking or rocking, usually due to a need for physical stimulation.
# Techniques For Guiding A Person
# With Visual Impairment
 1. Make contact: Lightly brush forearms with the per-son so he or she can find the back of your arm, just behind the elbow. Keep your elbow flexed to 90 degrees. This position enables the person to be at your side but about a half-step behind.
 2. Familiarize the person with the environment. When you give directions, give them according to the way the person is facing—left or right. When enter-ing a room, indicate number of people
 present,
size of room, and general description.
 3. Pause before any stairs or curbs. Describe the height of the step up or down.
 4. When approaching a door, inform the person whether the door will swing “away” or “toward” him or her and if it opens to the left or right. Swing the door open as far as possible and whisk the person through before it swings shut.
 5. When sitting, deposit the person at the back of the chair and allow him or her to seat himself or herself. Alternate method: back person up into the seat until the calves touch.
 6. If going through a narrow passageway, keep your elbow flexed, but internally rotate your shoulder, placing your arm behind your back. The person will then slide the hand from the back of your biceps to the middle of the forearm and step directly behind you.268Senior Fitness
# Indicated Exercise Program
It is recommended that each person with visual impairments have
a medical verification completed by an ophthalmologist. These doctors have differing philosophies regarding physical activities for visually impaired individuals (e.g., regarding bending over during exercise, putting the face in the water when swimming, etc.). Therefore, a phone call to the attending eye care specialist would be useful, especially in the case of diabetic retinopathy.
The mode of exercise may vary depending on the degree of vision
remaining and risk of injury to the eye. If an individual has no functional vision, his or her choice of physical activities may actu-ally expand since there is no fear of further deterioration.
Encourage cardiovascular endurance. The person with visual
impairments rarely gets an opportunity to engage in aerobic activi -
ties due to the amount of supervision or guiding required and thus often has low endurance. Utilize stationary cycling, low-intensity rowing on a row machine, tandem cycling, folk and square dance, aerobic dance, swimming, and jogging. If an indoor track is avail -
able, a guide wire can assist with independent locomotion. On an outdoor track, a sighted guide can assist with walking or jogging by simply touching forearms occasionally as the two move side-by-side; another method is to extend a short rope between the two persons to maintain contact and control. Swimming is an ideal activity because it builds strength and cardiovascular endurance while requiring minimal assistance from a partner. Swimming is easily adaptable as buoys and rope lanes prevent an individual from straying out of a lane while swimming laps. A “bonker” (soft sponge ball attached to a long wooden dowel) may be used to tap the swim -
mer on the head and signal the edge of the pool and end of the lap.
Develop individual sport activities and leisure skills that have car-
ry-over value. Because of equipment adaptations in sports such as archery, persons with visual impairments are able to participate and compete alongside sighted persons. Teaching adaptations have Sensory Problems in Older Adults
# Unit 17 269
also broadened sports participation by persons with visual impair-
ments; for example, snow skiing may be accomplished through the use of a sighted guide and auditory input. Mingling sighted part-ners with non-sighted partners allows folk dancing to be enjoyed by non-sighted people. Circle formations are especially helpful in providing spatial orientation during dance steps.
Postural exercises may need to be prescribed for lordosis, ptosis,
and kyphosis. These will be prescribed by the client’s attending physician and/or physical therapist.
Considerations for Diabetic Retinopathy
Aerobic exercise for persons with retinopathy includes stationary cycling, low-intensity rowing on a rowing machine, swimming, walking, and jogging. Adaptations for accomplishing these activities can be found elsewhere in this unit. Greenlee (1987) recommend -
ed that the heart rate not exceed that which elicits a systolic blood pressure of 170 mm Hg. The blood pressure should be monitored during every exercise session and intensity adjusted accordingly. This method is used because moderate exercise can raise systolic blood pressure to levels above 200 mm Hg, thereby risking further damage to the retina. A submaximal pretest should be conducted to establish initial exercise intensity. Resistive exercise using standard weight-lifting equipment is not recommended (unless a person is totally blind); however, if a weight-lifting regime is strongly desired by the participant, physician approval is requisite. For each resistive exercise, the load to be lifted should be such that the person can lift a minimum of fifteen repetitions per set with a resistance that does not cause undue fatigue. Exhaling on the lift/effort and inhaling on the return to starting position will prevent a Valsalva maneuver.
At present, there is no clear evidence that intensive physical train -
ing programs accelerate the progression of diabetic retinopathy.
However, certain types of exercise result in large increases of systolic blood pressure with concomitant increases in intraocular pressure; 270Senior Fitness
neuropathy: a disease of,
or damage to nervesthese exercises are contraindicated. Specifically, activities should be
avoided that involve (1) bending over so that the head is positioned lower than the waist, (2) Valsalva-type maneuvers that raise blood pressure, (3) any near maximal isometric contractions, (4) weight lifting with high resistance and low repetitions, (5) vigorous bounc -
ing such as high impact aerobics, (6) rapid eye-head movements found in contact sports, and (7) strenuous upper extremity exercise, which increases peripheral resistance to blood flow resulting in higher blood pressure. Jogging can produce irregular head move -
ments that may potentially aggravate an eye condition. Additional activities that are contraindicated include parachuting, scuba div -
ing, and yoga. The latter uses postures that increase intraocular pressure. Exercise is contraindicated if the person has recently undergone retinal photocoagulation treatment or eye surgery.
SENSORY DISORDERS: NEUROPATHY
Neuropathy is a disease of or damage to nerves that can be caused by various chronic conditions. When nerve damage or disease occurs outside of the brain or spinal cord, it is called a peripheral neuropathy.
# Autonomic Neuropathy
Disease or damage specifically to the nerves that regulate blood pressure, heart rate, bowel and bladder emptying, digestion, and other body functions is known as autonomic neuropathy.
Causes: chronic alcoholism, diabetes, disorders involving scarring
and hardening (sclerosis) tissues, Guillain Barre syndrome or other diseases that inflame nerves, HIV and AIDS, inherited nerve disor-ders, Parkinson’s disease, surgery or injury to the nerves.
Exercise considerations:  Stationary cycling or water exercises are
suggested; the latter is particularly beneficial for persons with ortho -
static hypertension because pressure of the water surrounding the Sensory Problems in Older Adults

body helps to maintain normal blood pressure. Sitting or semi-re -
cumbent exercises (which assist in maintaining blood pressure) are
also recommended for developing fitness levels. Strenuous exercise involving rapid changes in body position should be avoided as the concomitant changes in heart rate and blood pressure may trigger a hypotensive episode following exercise.
# Sensorimotor Neuropathy
Neuropathy can affect nerves that provide feeling (sensory neu-ropathy) or cause movement (motor neuropathy). It can also affect both, in which case it is called a sensorimotor neuropathy.
Causes: chronic alcoholism, cancer (called a paraneoplastic neurop-
athy), chronic inflammatory neuropathy, diabetes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hereditary neuropathy, vitamin deficiency (vitamins B12, B1, and E)
Exercise considerations: Persons with sensorimotor neuropa -
thy are more dependent on vision when performing motor skills
because proprioception is diminished in the extremities. The fol-lowing list provides strategies to facilitate movement in persons with sensorimotor neuropathy (Graham & Lasko-McCarthy, 1990):
 1. Use mirrors to facilitate body awareness of the
lower extremities.
 2. Enhance muscle tone by rubbing and tapping the dermatome (skin) of the muscle to be contracted.
 3. Use visual aids such as footprints placed on the floor during exercise.
 4. Teach principles of equilibrium such as (a) hands out to side, (b) lowering the center of gravity by bending knees, and (c) focusing on stationary object at eye level.


 5. Increase proprioception and stimulate joint reflexes by adding resistance to the movement (e.g., wrist weights or manually applied resistance).
 6. Use non-weight bearing activities such as arm exer-cises, swimming, and cycling for persons with loss of sensation to the feet.sensorimotor neurop-athy: disease or dam-
age to nerve cells, nerve fibers, and nerve coverings throughout the body, affecting both sensory and motor nerves
Sensory Problems in Older Adults
# Unit 17 273
 7. Inspect the feet before and after exercise for swell-
ing, heat, redness, or ulceration. Change shoes every five hours.
 8. Use towels or canes to facilitate stretching  exercises.
 9. Use external support such as a chair during
balance exercises.
# Conclusion
Communication is always an important component between client
and trainer and is even more crucial when working with individuals with sensory disabilities and individuals who may be returning to exercise after an injury, illness, or other absence. A common mis-take people make is beginning an exercise program without first consulting their physician or physical therapist. A doctor or physi-cal therapist can help set any movement limitations for your client as well as prescribe appropriate exercises and set realistic goals. It is then the responsibility of the client to communicate movement limitations and goals to you, the exercise leader or personal trainer. Once you are aware of the condition, you should follow up with a phone call to the doctor or physical therapist. This way, everyone involved is aware of all conditions and is working together to pro-vide your client with the safest and most effective program.
Proper progression is another component that will assure success
and safety. Often people try to return to their previous level of fit-ness too quickly which may result in re-injury. The goals, which you and your client set, should be both attainable and reasonable. As your client achieves new fitness goals, progressively increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of their activity over weeks and months. Advise clients to be “protective” of their bodies and to pay attention to warning signs. Follow the “2-hour rule”: If your client reports feeling unusual pain during or within two hours after exercise, they probably worked too hard, too fast, or mechanically incorrectly. You then should re-evaluate the program and make the necessary adjustments.

 • Understand the demographics of the older adult population
 • Target your marketing to places and functions that are frequented by older adults

# Business Basics
Many college graduates face the prospect of finding employment
after they receive their diplomas. In many professions, jobs are waiting if preparation is done well in advance of graduation. This assurance is not so well defined in fitness. From coaching to con-sulting, there are many avenues for new professionals to seek, but automatic job placement cannot be taken for granted.
# Employment By Gym
Upon becoming certified as a personal trainer, many individuals
elect to work as for organizations as employees. Gyms and health clubs, corporate wellness centers, resorts and hotels, hospitals, and retirement facilities all have been known to hire personal trainers able to work with older adults. The advantages of being an employ-ee include the security of a regular paycheck, employee benefits such as medical insurance and paid vacations, freedom from record keeping and income tax withholding, and above all, freedom from the necessity of going out and finding clients.
Advantages of Gym Employment
 • Regular paycheck.
 • Employee benefits.
 • Freedom from record keeping and tax details.
 • Do not have to find clients.
# Working For Yourself
The alternative to employee status is pursuing independent con-
tractorship or building your own personal training business. Independent contractors are independent business people who are hired to perform specific tasks. They are just like any other vendor, except they perform services rather than providing tangible prod-ucts. Independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment, disability, or workers’ compensation benefits because they are not the hiring firm’s employee. They are in business for themselves. The hiring firm does not have to pay employee-employer taxes or provide workers’ compensation insurance, and usually is not liable for the independent contractor’s actions. (For this reason, it is essential that you carry your own liability insurance if you plan 278Senior Fitness
to function as an independent contractor.) If you wish to form an
independent contractor relationship with a hiring firm, you should remember the following characteristics that must be satisfied to retain independent contractor status:
Characteristics of Independent Contractors
 • Hired on a job-to-job basis.
 • Operate as a separate business.
 • Offer their services to the general public.
 • Hired to perform a specific task.
 • No ongoing relationship or obligation to the hiring firm.
 • No control of the contractor’s work by the hiring firm.
The I.R.S. and local taxing authorities can assess severe penalties
upon businesses that improperly classify employees as indepen-dent contractors, so you should consult a knowledgeable attorney or accountant when forming such a relationship as an indepen-dent contractor.
Advantages of Independent Contractorship
 • You set your own hours.
 • You decide what rates to charge.
 • You can grow, expand, and progress based on your
abilities and efforts rather than an employer’s dictates.
Often, trainers begin their careers by working for a gym or health
club for a few months to build confidence and experience. Once they develop a private clientele, they gradually phase out of the relationship with the gym and operate as independent trainers.Business and Marketing Basics
# Unit 18 279
Where to Train
Many very highly paid trainers perform their services at their cli-
ents’ homes or at private exercise facilities owned by the trainer. It is easy and inexpensive to obtain portable equipment such as dumbbells, rubber-band resistance devices, and Swiss exercise balls that can be transported from session to session in the trunk of the car. If you wish to bring your private clients to a gym to train them, you can usually make such an arrangement with the gym owner or manager by explaining that some of your clients will likely even-tually become members of the gym. Usually the gym owner will require that you submit proof of your certification and liability insurance coverage, and that you pay a nominal fee (such as $10.00 per session) to the gym. This fee will normally be a small fraction of the fee you charge your clients.280Senior Fitness

Getting Started
It is normal to feel uncomfortable or even intimidated when con-
templating starting a fitness business. Anyone starting a new ven-ture feels the same way. Not to worry, however; as your experience in the field accumulates, you’ll gain confidence and your comfort level will improve. But before you actually begin to work with cli-ents, you’ll need to attend to business procedures. Preparation is the key to developing a successful personal training business.
Choose where and how you will work. It’s a good idea to start
your business in your hometown and the area that surrounds it.
Sometimes trainers move to another area (such as a large city) purely because of better business prospects, but usually you’ll be happier if you work where you want to live. Once you know where you want to work, you need to determine how you want to work. You can work as an independent contractor from your home, or you can subcontract your services with a local gym or club. At first you may want to pursue both avenues to allow yourself the great-est possible exposure to prospective clients.
Decide where you will set up your office. It may be in a separate
room at home, or you may obtain the privilege of using an existing room or office at the gym or club you have an agreement with. In either case, you must have all of the necessary forms, business cards, client logs, etc., in an accessible location. Another important reason to have an office is to have a location to interview prospec-tive clients, collect fees, and so on. Even if you don’t have an actual office, it’s important to have a consistent spot in the gym or health club where you leave your briefcase and other necessities during a session. A simple table and chair will do the job if nothing else is available. Important point: Use your office to showcase your diplo-mas, photos of clients you have trained, articles you have written, etc. They’re great credibility builders. Almost everyone who enters an office spends time looking at items on the wall while they’re waiting for you.Business and Marketing Basics

Establish policies and communicate them to your client at the
outset. Outline how you want to handle late clients, no shows, late payments, bounced checks, and other problems that may arise in a written policy. Being upfront about your policies will prevent mis-understandings and ensure a fair business relationship for all parties involved. If you have a written policy that late payments will result in a 10% service charge, you won’t feel uncomfortable charging it if a client does not pay on time. Avoid having to create a policy “on the spot.” You’ll feel uncomfortable, and your clients will sense a lack of professionalism. Be prepared and organized—it pays off!
Keep thorough client records. Thorough client records are vital
when working with older clients who have chronic conditions. Keep a file for each client including, at a minimum, a Health History Questionnaire, emergency contact information, and a training contract. Also use some type of attendance sheet, as well as a daily log. Use the log to track what exercises and training was done during the session, how well the client did, any unusual events (or injuries) that may have occurred, and anything else that you may feel to be noteworthy. After each training session, immediately fill out the client’s training log while the experience is still fresh in your memory. Not only will this practice keep you focused better on your client’s progress, but it will also be a valuable asset should a lawsuit develop. You’ll be able to demonstrate that you’re a pro-fessional who keeps accurate and detailed records on each client.
# Marketing Basics
In order for you to use all of this valuable information about how to best train the older adult, you’ll need to find a way to market your services to older adults. For many, this is the hardest part. This unit is designed to provide you with some suggestions about how to find clients so you can use the knowledge you have learned. And make no mistake, this important and expanding segment of the world’s population is out there waiting for you. Dr. Peterson, in his book Gray Dawn, states that global aging will become the most crucial 282Senior Fitness

With increasing life spans and advances in medicine, this figure is projected to expand to nearly 30 percent by 2030. By then, the population of people over eighty-five years of age in the USA will be triple today’s numbers.
WHO IS AN OLDER ADULT?
Currently, the population is divided into five generations:
 • Matures, born between 1900 and 1945
 • Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964

# Unit 18 283

Trainers interested in pursuing fitness education with older adults
will find clients who are either Matures or Baby Boomers. The life experience of each group will influence their opinions on health and fitness, the amount they are willing to pay for your services, and the value they attach to personal training. Given these vari-ables, it will be important for you to learn what kind of individual your client is, what your client wants, and what your client is will-ing to pay, and to develop a clear and concise message that takes all of these things into account.
Once you develop a philosophy and your mission is clear, you are
on your way.
Remember that “marketing” is anything and everything you do,
whether informally or formally, to recruit and retain clients. If you rely on the sales staff at the gym or fitness center to “market” your training, you risk losing clients. You will need to learn how to nurture clients yourself to grow your base. How you interact with each of the subgroups mentioned above will be different, but to be 284Senior Fitness

successful in working with any older adult, you must be adaptable,
respectful, and resourceful.
It is critical that you learn as much as possible about your market
and discard any preconceived ideas about how people will behave. One recent study debunked many myths about the buying behavior of older women. Marketers who understand and appreciate the real motivations of older shoppers will have an enormous opportunity to grow their business. Keep in mind that most older adult shop-pers want to “buy” a product, not be “sold” a product. Older adult shoppers typically won’t fall for the gimmicks used with younger and more naive shoppers. The paradigm of “pushing” sales will not work with this audience. What will work is offering services that will “pull” the client to you. Developing a referral base is one exam-ple. Your reputation will bring in more clients than an expensive ad in the yellow pages.
# Reaching Older Adults
If you desire to work with older adults, begin marketing your ser-vices in places where older individuals are likely to be on a regular basis. Recreation centers that offer senior services and events that foster socialization are great places to meet older adults who are interested in staying fit. Retirement communities are also ideal places to begin marketing your services. Such places aren’t neces-sarily staffed with nurses and therapists who can work with resi-dents on fitness. You may offer your services once or twice a week to work one-on-one with seniors or teach small groups. A letter to the facility director, followed up with a phone call, may prove to be all you need to get your foot in the door if there are no rehabilita-tion or exercise programs in place. Recreation and senior centers also often have bulletin boards and newsletters to keep members updated on upcoming events and services for seniors. Place an ad in one of these places or do an interview for the newsletter to pro-mote senior fitness and your training services.Business and Marketing Basics
# Unit 18 285
Also keep in mind that a high percentage of seniors are taking pre-
scription drugs for various chronic conditions. Post a flyer adver-tising your services at your local drugstore. Or consider providing a brown bag lecture series at the drugstore. Older adults tend to trust their pharmacist’s advice, so telling the pharmacist about your business and getting his or her support can do a lot to generate clients.
Becoming familiar with your local area physician’s network is
another smart idea. Find out which doctors in your area are doing the most work with older adults. Getting a physician’s referral can be a great way to get your business rolling. A good reputation with-in the medical community is priceless when working with senior clients. Many doctors are becoming more receptive to the idea of utilizing exercise as a means to control or reduce the symptoms of existing conditions in their older clients. Doctors also recognize the quality-of-life improvements seen in older adults who are already participating in regular exercise. Present yourself to physicians as a qualified trainer desiring to work as a part of the treatment team. Even if some doctors don’t refer any patients directly, they may let you advertise in their clinic or office.
Each year there are many events sponsored locally and nationally
that will draw senior participation. Be there too! Walk for a cause, attend a health fair, or set up your own booth. Contact the local chamber of commerce or visit your city’s website to find out when these events will take place in your area. These events also lend themselves to networking with other people in the health and fit-ness field.
Don’t forget about your local gyms and fitness centers either. Some
of them may already have a senior fitness program in place, but oth-ers may desire to get one started. Speak with the manager and find out if you can post a business flyer on the bulletin board. Managers rarely refuse an opportunity to increase their club membership! Focus on the fitness centers close to local retirement communities 286Senior Fitness

# Unit 18 287
or those serviced by public transportation. Many seniors use cabs,
busses, and community center van services to get around town.
Finally, if you are currently training athletes or general fitness cli-
ents, let them know that you are interested in expanding your busi-ness to accommodate an older population. Your clients may have family, neighbors, or friends who could benefit from your services. Word of mouth is one of the best ways to get new clients.

# Basics Of Assisting A  Person In A Wheelchair
Many people are unsure how to act when confronted by a person
in a wheelchair. A wheelchair is part of the user’s body space and should be respected. Always ask whether the wheelchair user needs assistance. Always explain what you are doing and where you are going before starting to push a chair. Never surprise a person from
behind by moving his or her chair. Wheelchairs can be tricky to
handle, so here are some points to remember:
 • Be aware that the wheelchair user might be able
to walk with the assistance of a cane, crutches,

or braces.
 • Don’t try to maneuver a wheelchair alone unless you are sure you can handle the weight and move-ment safely.
 • Ask how the chair operates. Are the armrests, leg rests, and body supports secure? Is there a seat belt? Are the brakes working properly? The brakes are located on both sides of the chair, just above the large wheels, and can be operated by a lever. Locate the brakes before you attempt to move the chair. Learn how to safely tip a chair back.
 • Be sure to lock the brakes when leaving the client even for a moment. Be sure to lock the brakes when transferring in or out of the chair.
 • Plan a route for where you are taking the client in the chair. Avoid narrow doorways and openings, stairs, bumpy surfaces, and wet floors. Be alert for objects in your path. Ask the client if there is a pre-ferred path to take.
 • If you are assisting by pushing a wheelchair over rough terrain, the chair will ride easier and jolt its occupant less if it is tilted back on its rear wheels.
 • While descending a curb with a wheelchair, the pusher should be behind the chair, tilting it back on its rear wheels. The pusher can then control  the descent by the use of pressure against his

own legs. It is important that both wheels touch the lower level simultaneously to avoid jolting  the occupant.
 • If assisting while ascending a curb, tip the chair back, and place the front or small wheels on the upper level; then, using the rear wheels, ride on to the upper level or sidewalk, using your legs to pro-vide pressure. 292Senior Fitness
transfer: The relocation
of an individual from one surface to another; can be classified as either “stand-ing” or “sitting.”TRANSFERS
Transfer refers to the relocation of an individual from one surface
to another and can be classified as either “standing” or “sitting.” Variations on these two types of transfers depend on the capabili-ties of the client and the type of surface to which the person is trans-ferring. Many individuals have developed a personal technique for executing a transfer, and this preference should be discussed before the assistant or instructor attempts to help. It is paramount that the safety of client and transfer be of utmost concern. Allow the client to do as much as is safely possible to do.
# Techniques For Assisting
# A Person To Transfer
Students coming to training in a wheelchair may need to transfer
into a regular chair or onto a mat to better perform the exercise program. Other students who walk with a cane or walker may also need guidance when standing up, sitting down, or getting on or off of a piece of exercise equipment. The inabilities and abilities that are identified at the time of assessment will determine the amount and kind of assistance required by a person during a transfer. The person should only be given the assistance actually needed. The principal guideline for assistance is to provide safety and protection during the transfer. In the case of an especially obese person, two assistants may be required. Do not attempt any activity beyond your capacity. The following basic concepts will help you to trans-fer anyone:
 • Stand as close to the client as possible. This
means standing in front of the client to assist with
a sitting transfer. For standing transfers that require extensive assistance, stand in front of the client so that you can actually provide support and protec-tion. If only minimal assistance is needed in the standing transfer, you may stand by the client’s side, preferably by the weaker side. Lightweight chairs need to be stabilized as well; either hold on to the back of the chair, or place it against a solid wall or table.Transfers and Ambulation Aids
# Appendix A 293
 • Stand with a broad base of support. In other
words, your feet should be kept apart, with one
foot slightly ahead of the other. This will improve your balance and also permit a shift of weight with greater ease.
 • Assist the
client at the waist rather than
pulling his arms or shoulders. The use of the belt of the pants or a transfer belt allows a good grip without causing the client pain.
 • Bend your
hips and knees, keeping your
back straight, while actually assisting the client to move from one surface to another.
 • Make sure
that the client can see the sur-
face to which he or she is transferring.
 • Always move
your body in the direction in
which the transfer is taking place.
 • Make sure
that the client is wearing shoes
(and a brace if this has been prescribed), in order to prevent possible slipping, foot injury, or turning of an ankle.
 • Be sure
your client understands when you
are transferring him or her. Count out loud so you both move together.294Senior Fitness

sliding board: Support
board used to facilitate a
transfer by bridging the gap between two areas.SITTING TRANSFERS—UNASSISTED
Any sitting transfer, assisted or unassisted, has the following
basic elements:
 • The person should wear a transfer belt around the
waist in case assistance might be needed.
 • The wheelchair should be positioned at a 45° angle to the opposite surface if the armrests are not removable from the chair. If the armrests are removable, the chair can be positioned directly parallel to the opposite surface.
 • Brakes must be locked.
 • Footrests should be moved away in most cases.
 • If a sliding board  is used, it must rest securely on
both surfaces, i.e., the surface to which the client is transferring and the surface from which the client is transferring.
 • It is recommended that the hemiplegic person learn to transfer toward the uninvolved side.Transfers and Ambulation Aids

SITTING TRANSFERS—ASSISTED
The basic elements of unassisted transfers also apply to assisted
transfers. In an assisted sitting transfer, the client comes to the edge of the bed or mat as in the unassisted transfer. Bend your hips and knees to lower yourself to the level of the client. Grip the transfer belt from underneath, or support the client under the armpits, and 296Senior Fitness

assist as the client angles toward the chair. As the client moves
from one surface to another, support the client’s knees with your own knees. Using the transfer belt, you are able to lift the buttocks up and onto the other surface. Throughout the transfer, the client leans forward in order to maintain trunk balance. Once in the chair, you may have to help to position the client by pushing the knees back by pressure from your own. This is done while leaning the trunk forward or doing a push-up. You can also move the client back into the chair by standing behind the chair and utilizing the client’s transfer belt.
STANDING TRANSFERS—ASSISTED
When you use a transfer belt around the client’s waist, stand directly in front of the client with your feet slightly apart. You may also support under the shoulders. Bend your hips and knees to the level of the client and assist by pulling him or her to the standing position by grasping the belt at the waist from underneath. If the client has weakness at the knee, you can brace your knee against the client’s weak knee in order to stabilize it. Once he or she is in a standing position, you can assist the client to pivot. The person should lean forward and gently lower into the chair. Transfers and Ambulation Aids

SUMMARY: A DOZEN TIPS FOR
# Performing Transfers
 1. Reduce the distance between the transfer surfaces.
Removing arm rests and detachable footrests will permit closer positioning of the client to the trans-fer surface.
 2. Always secure wheelchair brakes. They are essential for safety and stability.
 3. Transfer to a surface of equal height if possible. A sliding board may be used to eliminate the gap between the two surfaces. Be sure to stabilize the sliding board on both transfer surfaces.
 4. When transferring an individual with one-sided involvement (e.g., hemiplegia), position the wheel-chair alongside the table on the individual’s stron
-
ger side. Provide assistance from the  weaker side.
 5. Keep a wide base of support. Placing one foot ahead of the other allows you to shift your weight more easily.
 6. Keep your back straight while flexing at the hips and knees during the transfer. Hold the client  as close as possible and lift with the thigh

muscles, extending at the knees and hips, not  with your back.
 7. If possible, allow the individual to view the surface to which he or she is being transferred.
 8. To increase the stability of the wheelchair, place the casters (i.e., the front wheels) in a forward posi-tion.
 9. Give clear instructions regarding the transfer to  the client.
 10. Count “1-2-3-go,” so that you and the client  move together.
 11. Get additional assistance if necessary.
 12. Always protect your back! Consider using back- support braces.298Senior Fitness
# Progressive Mobilization
Progressive mobilization is the term used to describe the gradual,
step-by-step development of a person’s ability to move around and gain independence. The following activities are designed to build on one another.
# Mat Or Bed Activities
These are generally accomplished in the hospital as bed activities, and include bed positioning, range-of-motion exercises, moving up and down in bed, moving sideways, and rolling over in bed. However, as clients prepare to perform exercises lying down on mats, we frequently need to remind them of the proper techniques involved in moving around as well as getting up and down.
 1. Moving up, down, or sideways: instruct your
client as follows—”Bend your knees and put your
feet flat on the mat.” You can assist by holding down one or both knees and feet if they slip. Instruct, “Lift your hips off the mat by pushing with your feet. Move your hips in the desired direc-tion (up, down, or sideways) before putting them down.” You may also have to assist by putting your arm or arms under the buttocks. Remember your proper body mechanics.
 2. Rolling Over:
 If your client needs to roll to the
right side, instruct them as follows—”Move side-ways to the left to ensure that there is enough room to roll to the right” (many people become frightened when they get too close to the edge). “Cross your left leg over the right leg as far as pos-sible. Cross the left arm over your chest. Pull on the mat or railing as needed. If you need momentum, swing the arm or leg across your body.”
 3. Assuming a
Sitting Position: Instruct the cli-
ent—”From a side-lying position, slide your arm underneath you with your elbow bent. Now do these two things at the same time: drop your legs off the mat and start pushing up with your elbow. Transfers and Ambulation Aids
# Appendix A 299
After your weight has been transferred onto your
elbow, shift your weight to your hand and keep pushing until you are upright.” If the client needs help, assist as necessary, but encourage them to do as much as possible by themselves. Watch for dizzi-ness when upright.
 4. Si
tting (sitting down is addressed after
Standing): Sitting tolerance (length of time out
of bed) is accomplished during the hospital reha -
bilitation phase. Sitting balance is an activity often practiced as part of an adaptive physical fitness program. This helps develop trunk stability for standing and walking. The person should ultimate -
ly be able to sit unsupported, even against resis-tance. Instruct the client to: “Sit level on the mat or chair—weight even, on both buttocks. Position feet flat on the floor—wide base of support. Place arm or arms where you can push to maintain a good, erect position.”
 As sitting balance improves, the client should be able to sit without holding on to the edge of the mat and should be able to move his or her arms around at will. The client should practice reaching above the head, out to the side, and out in front. A mirror may be helpful. After the client can do the aforementioned, add resistance to the activity by pushing on the client from either side, from the front, or from the back. (Let the client know that you are going to do this exercise, and get permis -
sion first!) Good sitting balance is achieved when the client can do all of this.
 5. Standing: The “stand-up” is a necessary exercise even if the client cannot yet walk, because it facili
-
tates pulling up pants, going to the bathroom, and many other functions. Strength and balance are increased, as is overall circulation. A person will feel tremendously successful when he or she is able to stand up alone. However, don’t let the client rush to do it; make sure the correct steps are followed so that it will be done properly and efficiently. Give the following instructions: “Scoot your hips/but-tocks to the front edge of the chair. Put your feet flat on the floor, feet apart, with your stronger leg 300Senior Fitness
a little further back and under you. The legs will do
the work. Use your hands only for balance (on the table, chair, or bars). Lean your head and shoulders forward and stand on the count of 1-2-3.”
 6. Si
tting down: Sitting down is accomplished in
the reverse of standing. Instruct the client to lean forward while bending the knees and to touch down slowly with the buttocks. If a person is too weak to perform the stand-up exercise alone, adjust the chair as high as possible and provide assistance until the individual can stand alone. To evaluate when a person is able to stand, test quadriceps strength. If the person can hold against some resistance, he or she can probably stand.  Also, try to help the client stand. If the client can stand, it is obvious that he or she can perform the exercise. If the client cannot stand, use resistive exercises until leg strength increases sufficiently to enable standing.
 If balance is very poor, have the client assume a wide base of support on the bars with the hands. Then have the client lift his or her hands off the bars and raise them sideways and overhead while maintaining balance. The client’s ability to complete this exercise will increase with practice and gradual gain in strength. Later, resistance can be given by pushing the client unexpectedly from side to side, forward and back. This will stress balance and will increase ability. (Again, let the client know that you are going to do this exercise, and get permission!)
# Ambulation Aids
People with a lower-extremity disability usually require some form
of assistive device during ambulation. Canes, crutches, and walkers serve as extensions that permit the upper extremities to transmit force to the floor, providing support for the lower extremities and improving balance. Because of the diversity of ambulation aids, their prescription and fit should be carefully evaluated by a phy-sician or licensed physical therapist. The person with a disability Transfers and Ambulation Aids
# Appendix A 301
should receive instruction in their use, including proper gait pat-
tern, ascending and descending stairs, and sitting and arising. Pre-ambulation exercises and training are often necessary for persons with severe disabilities (Jebsen, 1967).302Senior Fitness
# Walkers
Types of Walkers
 1. Walkerette. This model has runners attached to
the bars and is pushed forward along the floor. It is not lifted by the user like a standard walker.
 2. Roller Walker.
 This model has wheels on the
front legs so that the individual can raise the rear legs off the floor and roll the walker forward.
 3. Crutch Walker. This model has crutches attached
to the horizontal bars to support body weight. It also has a seat for the individual to rest on when fatigued. The crutches can be removed or draped to the sides when not in use.
 4. Walk-abouts.
 A walkabouts open front design
assists persons with limited weight bearing abili-ties. A walkabout walker is comprised of a frame with casters at the base that is open in the front. A support frame is located in the back with a support system that wraps around the torso with straps or buckles and has a seat that fits between the legs to partially support the weight of the body.

# Crutches
The use of crutches requires more balance, strength, and coordina-
tion than a walker. One or two crutches may be used, depending upon the extent of support needed.
Types of Crutches
 1. Axillary (armpit) crutch.
 2. Canadian, Lofstrand, or Elbow Extension Crutch.
This crutch has no shoulder rest and is usually pre-scribed for persons who can ambulate using the four-point crutch gait and need support for weak arm musculature.
 3. Gutter Crutch. This crutch has been designed for persons with a significant flexion deformity at the elbow, painful wrist, or very poor hand function. The forearm may be secured to the crutch by a Velcro strap or other fastening.Transfers and Ambulation Aids
# Appendix A 303

2. Canadian Crutch
3. Gutter Crutch
Figure APa-5  Types of crutches: Auxillary Crutch, Canadian Crutch,
and Gutter Crutch.
Crutch Adjustment
The crutch height should always be adjustable. It is also prefera-
ble to use crutches that are adjustable with respect to length and position of the arm support (Cash, 1976). The length of the axil-lary crutch should extend from a point two inches below the axilla (armpit) to a point near the foot indicated in the illustration below. The height of the handgrip should be positioned so that the elbow is flexed between 15° to 30°. The wrists should be hyperextended and the weight borne on the palms. When fitting axillary crutches, it is essential that the user be instructed not to bear weight on the axillary bar. This may cause compres-sion of the radial nerve, resulting in paral-ysis, which may take months to resolve. The true purpose of this bar is to provide lateral stability of the crutch via pressure against the chest wall. Regularly check crutch tips for worn areas, cracking, or plugging of the grooves with lint and dirt.
# Canes
Canes are generally prescribed when some weight bearing can be taken on the affected extremity or when only mild balance deficits exist. It is difficult for a person to develop a normal walking pattern with one cane. Because a cane supports approximately 20-25 per-cent of the body weight, the tendency is to lean the body over the cane and shorten the stride on that side.
Types of Canes
 1. Standard Cane. This model is made of wood or alu-
minum with a C-curved handle. A telescoping cane is available that can be adjusted to between 22 to 38 inches.304Senior Fitness
6”
2”
 2. Tripod Cane. This model has three prongs at the end
of the shaft with flexible rubber sockets, allowing for

movement of the shaft while the prongs remain in contact with the ground during ambulation.
 3. Quad Cane. This model has four prongs that come in contact with the floor. It is adjustable in length and provides maximum support and balance with four contact points on the ground. This device is frequently prescribed for those with athetoid cere-bral palsy.
Cane Adjustment
The length of the cane is determined by measuring the vertical dis-
tance from the greater trochanter (the top of the femur) to the floor. The elbow should be flexed approximately 15° to 30°. The cane should be held in the hand opposite the affected leg. During ambulation, the cane should be held fairly close to the side to avoid leaning.
# Wheelchairs
The market currently offers a wide selection of wheelchairs, from heavy-duty chairs to light sport models with racing tires. In addi-tion, a variety of sizes are available such as Adult, Narrow-Adult, Tall, Junior, and Children’s sizes. Some companies will even cus-tomize the size of a chair to the individual. Sport and Spokes, a magazine for athletes with disabilities, publishes an annual review of the latest models of sport wheelchairs. A physician or physical therapist familiar with the sizes, models, and components of wheel-chairs will prescribe a suitable chair for an individual.
Assistants should become familiar with the basic components of
the wheelchair and their operation. The following page contains a description of the most basic components of a typical wheelchair. There are many additional accessories, which can be attached to the wheelchair to enhance its effectiveness to the user. Transfers and Ambulation Aids
# Appendix A 305
 1. Wheels. For ease of ride over outdoor terrain (soft,
sandy or rough ground), pneumatic tires (i.e., air-
filled, like bicycle tires) are recommended.
 2. Handrims. Handrims are connected to the wheels
to allow the user to move the wheelchair without injuring the hands. Handrims come in a variety of sizes and types, depending on the sport and the ability of the individual. Rubber-coated handrims are available to persons with quadriplegia. For the client with severe limitations of grip, a handrim consisting of eight rubber-tipped vertical projec
-
tions is available.
 3. Backrest. The height of the backrest depends on

the height of the user and the degree of trunk sta-bility. Reclining backrests are available for those who need to be in a partially or fully reclined position.
 4. Armrest.
 Armrests may be either detached or
fixed. Detachable armrests easily lift off to allow the convenience of side transfers. The height of the armrests can usually be adjusted to accommodate the changes created by a wheelchair cushion.
 5. Wheel locks
(brakes). These brakes prevent the
wheelchair from rolling forward or backward on inclines and during transfers.
 6. Casters.
 These small wheels sit towards the front
of the wheelchair. Casters are most stable when they have anti-flutter caster bearings. Casters also come in the following styles: heavy-duty, light-weight, and pneumatic (for a cushioned ride with a freer roll).
 7. Front rigging.
 This consists of a footrest or leg-
rest. Legrests are used with those who need the legs elevated. Both types of rigging typically have a swing-away feature, which allows for a close approach to transfer surfaces. Heel-loops help pre-vent feet from sliding off of the footplate.306Senior Fitness
Transfers and Ambulation Aids
# Appendix A 307
# Unit Summary
 I. A wheelchair is part of the user’s body and should be
respected as such. Always ask if the user needs assis-tance and be familiar with the basics of assisting a person in a wheelchair before attempting to move the chair.
 II. A “transfer” is the relocation of an individual from one surface to another, and there are many variations on the basic “sitting” and “standing” transfer.
 a. Many people have developed a personal technique for doing a transfer, and this preference should always be discussed before an instructor attempts to help.
 b. Always allow clients to do as much of the transfer for themselves as is safely possible.
 III. Progressive mobilization is the gradual development of a person’s ability to move around and gain indepen-dence. Many mat and bed activities can be used to assist with this process.
 IV. People with a lower-extremity disability usually require some sort of ambulation aid such as a cane or crutch-es. Pre-ambulation exercises and training can be nec
-
essary for people with severe disabilities.

 II. Procedures for Spinal Screening
  After completing this unit you will be able to:
 • Understand some of the possible underlying
causes of postural deviations
 • Conduct a basic postural evaluation
 • Conduct a spinal screening
Prior to assessing postural deviations, it is necessary to have an
understanding of possible underlying causes of deviations. This knowledge will assist in determining whether medical referral or exercise prescription is the more appropriate intervention.
To conduct a posture evaluation, use a posture screen or plumb line
in conjunction with observations. A plumb line is a thick piece of rope suspended from the ceiling with a weighted end that does not reach to the floor. If pictures are used, the participant should be pho-tographed in anterior, posterior, and lateral views. The participant should be barefoot, wearing a swimsuit, and have hair pulled back behind the ears. If a large group has to be screened at the same time, stations should be set up with individuals rotating to each station.posture: The position of
different parts of the body
at rest or during move-ment.
postural deviation(s):
An abnormality or depar-
ture from correct posture.
# Posture Evaluation
# Strength
Abdominals
Weak abdominal musculature has been implicated in the occurrence
of low-back pain. No test exists that purely measures abdominal strength; current tests also involve the hip flexors. Bent-knee sit-ups partially eliminate the action of the hip flexors during movement.
# Flexibility
Participant assumes a “hook-lying” position. Keeping the lower back pressed to the floor (assistant should check by placing a hand between the lumbar region and floor), the participant extends arms overhead and presses the back of the arms and hands to the floor. Elbows must remain locked at all times.
Chest and Shoulders
Scoring: Within Normal Limits (WNL): Contact of dorsum of hands with the floor.
Limitation of Motion (LOM): Contact of fingers only or cannot
make contact with floor without arching the lower back.
Spine and Hip Extensors
Scoring: WNL: If thigh remains flat on the table.
LOM: If thigh lifts upward. Estimate angle between leg and table.
Note: If thigh rotates outward or inward, rotators are tight. Indicate
this on evaluation form. 310Senior Fitness
ANTERIOR/POSTERIOR VIEW
Have the participant stand so that a plumb line is at
a point midway between the medial malleoli, bisect-ing the body (see following illustration).
Note any of the following:
 • Head Twist (torticollis) or Head
Tilt: Check the evenness of the ear-
lobes and indicate left or right drop.
 • Shoulder Level:
 Note evenness of
acromion process and indicate left
or right drop.
 • Linea Alba:
 Indicate a shift to the
left or right.
 • Anterior Superior
Iliac Spines
(hip): Note evenness and indicate left or right drop.
 • Leg Alignment: Beginning at the
center of the knee, draw a line per
-
pendicular to the floor.
 a) Internal or external rotation at the hip: The knee and foot both point outward or inward.
 b) Internal tibial torsion: The patella faces inward when the feet are together and pointing forward.
 c) Genu valgum (knock-knees): Note the space between the medial malleoli when knees are touching.
 d) Genu varum (bowlegs): Note the space between the femoral condyles when the feet are together.
 e) Pronation: The big toe (first metatarsal) falls laterally to the plumb line drawn from the center of the knee.Assessment of Posture

# Lateral View
Draw a plumb line beginning with a point one
inch anterior to the center of the lateral malle-olus and precede upward, perpendicular to the floor. In ideal posture, the plumb line should pass through the following fixed checkpoints: center of the knee (behind the patella), center of the hip (greater trochanter), center of the shoulder (acro-mion process), and the earlobe (tragus). Postural abnormalities are based on the deviation (forward or backward) from this line.
Note any of the following:
 • Body Lean: Indicate whether for -
ward or backward.
 • Head: Considered forward if the
earlobe is in front of the acromion process.312Senior Fitness

 • Kyphosis: Excessive flexion in the thoracic spine.
Check for structural kyphosis in “Adam’s position” (bending forward about 90° with hands together, feet together, and head down as if diving into

a pool).
 • Lordosis: Excessive hyperextension in the lumbar spine area.

scholiosis: Abnormal
lateral curvature of the ver-
tebral column. Depending on etiology there may be one curve, or primary and secondary compensatory curves.Orthopedic Evaluation: should be performed by qualified professional.
# Scoliosis Check
See “Procedure for Spinal Screening” below. Scoliosis screening is
usually performed on children in elementary and secondary grades, since treatment is very difficult after bone growth is complete. However, older participants experiencing low-back pain may bene-fit from this type of screening to determine the nature of their pain.
# Procedures For Spinal Screening
First
Ask if there is a history of Scoliosis in the family.
Second
Look at participant’s back while he or she is standing. Ask yourself:
 • Are the earlobes level?
 • Are the shoulders (acromion processes) the
same level?
 • Are the inferior borders of the scapulae the  same level?
 • Are the arms the same distance from the body?
 • Are the trunk contours the same on both sides  of the body?
 • Are the hips level?
 • Are the poplitial creases level?
The above are pieces of a puzzle. A positive finding in any of the
above areas may be a normal variant or may indicate scoliosis. The next check is perhaps the most important. 314Senior Fitness
Third
The participant bends forward about 90˚ with hands together, feet
together, and head down as if diving into a pool (Adam’s position). View the participant from the back. Ask yourself: is one side of the thoracic or lumbar spine higher than the other?
Fourth
The participant bends forward as above, but view the participant from the front. Ask yourself: is one side of the thoracic or lumbar spine higher than the other?
Fifth
Take a quick look at the side view of the participant as a check for kyphosis. Ask yourself: is the curve even or does it peak? With chil-dren and teenagers a medical referral is warranted if an asymmetry is noted in Adam’s position, indicating possible structural scoliosis. Adults are generally not referred because bone growth is complete. Exercises can be prescribed to combat pain and loss of flexibility. Assessment of Posture

A
abduction: Movement of a limb away from middle axis of the body, such as extend-
ing arms outward at shoulder height from a hanging-down position.
abs: Slang for abdominal muscles.accommodating resistance: A weight training machine which, through the use of
air, fluid or clutch plates in tandem with a flywheel, controls the speed with which you are able to move.  By controlling speed, the exertion you are able to deliver is always at maximum throughout the entire range of motion of an exercise.  This technology is very useful during rehabilitation, when injuries are present, and also in sports training for speed-strength.  (See Isokinetic Resistance, Variable Resistance and Constant Resistance.)
acute: Sudden, short-term, sharp or severe. Cf. chronic
adaptation: The adjustment of the body (or mind) to achieve a greater degree of
fitness to its environment.  Adaptations are more persistent than an immediate response to the new stimuli of the environment.
adduction: Movement of a limb toward middle axis of the body.  Returning arms to
the side from extended position at shoulders.adherence: Used to describe a person’s continuation of a behavior, as in an exercise
program. adenosine triphosphate (ATP): The body’s energizer, an organic compound pres-
ent in muscle fibers that is broken down through a variety of enzymatic processes.  The resultant spark of energy released stimulates hundreds of microscopic filaments within each cell, triggering muscle contraction.
adipose tissue: Fat tissue.adhesion: Fibrous tissue holding muscles or other parts together that have been
altered or damaged through trauma.
aerobic: Using oxygen.aerobic activities: Activities using large muscle groups at moderate intensities that
permit the body to use oxygen to supply energy and to maintain a steady state for more than a few minutes.
aerobic capacity (VO2 max): The highest rate of oxygen consumption of which a
person is capable. Also referred to as maximal oxygen uptake.
aerobic exercise: Activities in which oxygen from the blood is required to fuel the
energy-producing mechanisms of muscle fibers.  Examples are running, cycling and skiing over distance.  Aerobic means “with oxygen.”
aerobic endurance: The ability to continue aerobic activity over a period of time.aerobic strength endurance: Force produced footfall-per footfall (or move-
ment-per-movement) in the face of massive oxygen debt, such as that incurred in long distance training or competition (see cardiovascular/ cardiorespiratory endur-ance).  While many factors contribute to aerobic strength endurance, there are at least 9 critical components:
 1. Cardiovascular endurance relates to the efficiency in get-ting oxygenated and nutrient-rich
blood to the working
muscles, and “spent” blood back to the heart.
 2.
  Cardiorespiratory endurance involves the efficiency of the “loop” where the blood goes from the heart to the lungs,

gets rid of water and carbon dioxide, picks up oxygen, and returns to the heart for delivery to the body.
 3.  Max VO2 Uptake: Maximum Volume of Oxygen taken up by the working muscles. Expressed in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of bodyweight per minute (ml/kg/min).
 4.  Stroke Volume: The volume of blood pushed out of the left ventricle with each beat
 5.  Ejection Fraction: The percentage of the total volume of blood in the left ventricle that’s pushed out with each beat
 6.  Heart Rate: The number of times your heart beats during each minute.
 7.  Willingness to endure pain (especially from lactic acid accumulation)
 8.  Skill (at running, etc.)
 9.  Total Body Limit Strength: The 8 factors above being
equal, the strongest will win
aging: Growing older in years - experienced at different rates and in unique ways
by all individuals
agonist: A muscle that directly engages in an action around a joint. A muscle that
compliments the opposing action of it’s antagonist.aldosterone: Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that functions as the primary elec-
trolyte-regulatory steroid hormone.  It is secreted by the adrenal cortex.Alzheimer’s: A degenerative brain disorder characterized by premature senility
and dementia.
anaerobic exercise: Short-term activities (usually highly intense) in which muscle
fibers derive contractile energy from stored internal compounds without the use of oxygen from the blood.  These compounds include ATP, CP and Glycogen.  Short bursts of “all-out” effort, such as sprinting or weightlifting are examples of anaero-bic activities. Anaerobic activities, then, are activities using muscle groups at high intensities that exceed the body’s capacity to use oxygen to supply energy and which create an oxygen debt by using energy produced without oxygen. Anaerobic means “without oxygen.”
anaerobic strength endurance: Coming principally from the glycolytic pathway.
The emphasis is on repetitive muscular capacity such as required in boxing, wres-
tling, tug-o-war and high repetition training (more than 20 reps) without entering the aerobic phase of muscular energetics, and which involves the development of severe oxygen debt.  There are two general types of anaerobic strength endurance:
 1.  Speed endurance involves maintaining maximum speed over times lower than 3-4 minutes (e.g., 100, 400, 800 meter dashes in track & field).
 2.  Strength endurance is exerting maximum muscular effort time after time with no appreciable
decline in
force output.  Football linemen display this quality play-after-play for four quarters.
  Two other forms of anaerobic strength are limit strength and speed-strength, both of which derive energy from the ATP/CP pathway of muscular energetics.
anaerobic threshold: The point where increasing energy demands of exercise can not be met by the use of oxygen and an oxygen debt begins to be incurred.

nary artery.GLOSSARY 317Glossary
antagonist: A muscle that can provide an opposing action to the action of another
muscle (the agonist) around a joint.
antioxidants: Certain nutrients, substances and vitamins and minerals that protect
against free-radicals, highly unstable molecular fragments unleashed by strenuous
exercise, chemicals, polluted air, and other factors, that can cause extensive damage to the body.  Free radicals are involved in emphysema, wrinkled skin, cancer, blood clots, damage to cellular components and DNA, as well as muscle pains, cramps, and fatigue, and a host of other ailments and diseases normally associated with aging. Free-radical “scavengers” (another term for antioxidants) include vitamins A, C, E, selenium, zinc, and many different botanical preparations. (See free radicals.)

at most (examples: shot put, power-lifting, Olympic weightlifting, vertical jump).
attitude: A relatively constant feeling, predisposition, or set of beliefs toward an
object, person, or situation.average life expectancy: This term is often misunderstood. It is commonly used to
refer to the number of years than the average person will live of from birth. This number has increased significantly over the past century from 45 years to 76 years in developed countries. The increase is mainly due to reductions in infant mortality, deaths due to childbirth, and reduction in infectious diseases rather than extension of the adult life span.

gerontology: The scientific study of aging and problem or issues associated with
aging.
Golgi Tendon Organs: Nerve sensors (“proprioceptors”), located at the junction of
muscles and tendons, that pick up messages of excess stress on the muscle and cause
the brain to shut off muscle contraction. The purpose may be to protect against sep-arating the tendon from bone when a contraction is too great. Called “the feedback loop,” this shut-off threshold can be pushed back or delayed (e.g., toward one’s maximum strength potential) through “jerk training,” where you carefully perform repeated submaximum jerks with weights. See also muscle spindle, proprioceptor.
H
health risk appraisal: A procedure that gathers information about a person’s

same session.  Used to improve aerobic and anaerobic endurance in those people who have already developed an aerobic base.
ischemia: Inadequate blood flow to a body part, resulting in insufficient oxygen
supply.  Can be due to constricted or obstruction of a blood vessel.
isokinetic exercise: Exercise equipment using accommodating resistance technolo-

humped posture). It can be either the result of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis), developmental problems, osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebrae, and/or trauma.
L
lactic acid: A by-product of glucose and glycogen metabolism in anaerobic muscle energetics. A minute accumulation causes muscular fatigue and pain, and retards contraction. Lactic acid is carried by the blood to the liver, where it is reconverted to glucose and returned as blood glucose to the muscles. It is this elevation of blood lactic acid in sustained strenuous exercise, such as in marathon running, which results in muscle fatigue and pain. Recovery follows when enough oxygen gets to the muscle, part of the lactic acid being oxidized and most of it then being built up once more into glycogen.

obesity: Being excessively overweight; generally in excess of 25 (men) to 32 percent
body fatosteoarthritis: A noninflammatory joint disease of older persons. The cartilage in
the joint wears down, and there is bone growth at the edges of the joints. Results in
pain and stiffness, especially after prolonged exercise.
osteoporosis: Abnormal loss of bony tissue resulting in fragile porous bones attrib-
utable to a lack of calcium; most common in postmenopausal women.overuse: Excessive repeated exertion or shock which results in injuries such as stress
fractures of bones or inflammation of muscles and tendons.
overuse syndrome: Injury resulting from overtraining.oxygen: A colorless, odorless gas that makes up approximately 20% of the air; a
necessary element for respiration and sustaining life.

cising at.
peripheral vascular disease (PVD): Also known as peripheral artery disease (PAD)
or peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD), includes all diseases caused by the obstruction of large arteries in the arms and legs. PVD can result from athero-sclerosis, inflammatory processes leading to stenosis, an embolism, or thrombus formation. It causes either acute or chronic ischemia (lack of blood supply), typically of the legs.
physical fitness: The physiological contribution to wellness through exercise and
nutrition behaviors that maintain high aerobic capacity, balanced body compo-sition, and adequate strength and flexibility to minimize risk of chronic health problems and to enhance the enjoyment of life.
physical work capacity (PWC): An exercise test that measures the amount of work
done at a given, submaximal heart rate.  The work is measured in oxygen uptake, kilopond meters per minute, or other units, and can be used to estimate maximal heart rate and oxygen uptake.  Less accurate, but safer and less expensive than the graded exercise test.
postural deviation(s): An abnormality or departure from correct posture.posture: The position of different parts of the body at rest or during movement.
pronation: Assuming a facedown position. Of the hand, turning the palm backward GLOSSARY 321Glossary
or downward. Of the foot, lowering the inner (medial) side of the foot so as to flatten
the arch. The opposite of supination.
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF): Muscle stretches that use the
proprioceptors (muscle spindles) to send inhibiting (relaxing) messages to the muscle that is to be stretched.
protein: A compound comprised of amino acids. Protein is essential in the building
of new tissue and the repair of damaged tissue. Protein yields 4 calories per gram.psychomotor: Of, relating to, or characterizing movements of the body associated
with mental activity.
R
range-of-motion: Measurement of the extent to which a joint can go through all of its normal spectrum of movements.
rehabilitation: A planned program of training or treatment; designed to help people
who have suffered an injury or illness progress towards higher levels of physical or
mental independence.
repetition maximum (RM): The maximum times a weight can be lifted in an exer-
cise bout.  A 1RM would be the most weight lifted for one repetition.
respiration: Breathing. The act of taking air into the lungs to extract oxygen, then
exhaling to rid the body of excess carbon dioxide.respiratory exchange ratio: In one breath, you normally breathe in more molecules
of oxygen than you breathe out molecules of carbon dioxide. The ratio between these CO2 / %O2 is the respiratory exchange ratio (RER).
rest interval: Pause between sets of an exercise that allows muscles to recover par-
tially before beginning next set.
risk factors: Characteristics that may place a person at a higher risk for a certain
disease.
rotation: Movement around a center or axis.
S
sarcopenia: The degenerative loss of muscle mass related to aging.
scholiosis: Abnormal lateral curvature of the vertebral column. Depending on
etiology there may be one curve, or primary and secondary compensatory curves.sciatic nerve: The nerve running along the buttocks, posterior thigh and leg, origi-
nating primarily from the L5 and S1 nerve roots.
screening: A survey or examination used to assess or select; used in health settings
to determine whether medical attention is necessary prior to beginning or continu-ing an exercise regimen or similar program.
sedentary: Sitting a lot; not involved in physical activity that could produce signif-
icant fitness benefits.sensorineural hearing loss: A type of hearing loss in which the root cause lies in
the vestibulocochlear nerve (Cranial nerve VIII), the inner ear, or central processing centers of the brain.set: A group of repetitions of an exercise movement done consecutively, without
rest, until a given number, or momentary exhaustion, is reached.
sliding board: Support board used to facilitate a transfer by bridging the gap
between two areas.
spasm: An involuntary muscular contraction.sprain: Stretching or tearing of ligaments; may be caused by overuse or acute
injuries.
stability: Maintaining balance with ease, resistant to change.strain: A stretching or tearing of a musculotendinous unit.  Degrees of severity
include: first-degree, stretching of the unit; second-degree, partial tearing of the
unit; third degree, complete disruption of the unit.
strength: The ability to exert
stretch: Moving or extending limbs throughout a range of motion. Intentionally
placing tension upon a muscle for the purpose of lengthening it.stroke volume: The volume of blood pumped out of the heart into the circulatory
system by the left ventricle in one contraction.
submaximal heart rate: Equates to about 70 to 85 percent of maximal heart rate
(MHR).
supination: Assuming a horizontal position facing upward. In the case of the hand,
it also means turning the palm to face forward. The opposite of pronation.Synapse: The junction between nerves.
systolic blood pressure: The blood pressure measurement that reflects the pressure
of the blood in the arteries that results from the contraction of the heart.
T
target heart rate: The recommended heart rate that an individual should maintain while training.
tendon: A band of connective tissue that attaches muscle to bone.
therapy: Related to fitness and sports: therapy is the application of a substance
or technique in the prevention, management, and treatment of common athletic
injuries and related problems.
threshold: The minimum level required to attain an outcome.
torque: The effect generated by force causing rotation.
total lung capacity: The sum of the residual volume and the vital capacity. transfer: The relocation of an individual from one surface to another; can be classi-
fied as either “standing” or “sitting.”treadmill: A machine that has a moving belt that allows a person to walk in place;

type of lipid (fat) found in adipose tissue.Type II fibers: The fast twitch muscle fibers of the body that are responsible for
high levels of strength.322Senior Fitness
U
unsupervised program: A program or regimen of physical training that is not per-
formed while in the presence of a qualified health/fitness professional. Appropriate for low risk, healthy people.
uric acid: A byproduct of the purine metabolism which in its turn is a product
of nucleic acid breakdown. The majority of uric acid is synthesized in the liver.
Elevated levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia) and its salts are associated with forma-tion of urate crystals causing gout and kidney stones.
urinary incontinence: Inability to control the flow of urine and involuntary
urination.
V
Valsalva response: If the glottis (the narrowest part of the larynx is closed following
full inspiration and the expiratory muscles are fully activated, the compressive forces of exhalation can increase the intrathoracic pressure from 2 or 3 mm Hg to upwards of 100 mm Hg above atmospheric pressure. This forced exhalation against a closed glottis is called the Valsalva maneuver (named after the Italian anatomist who first explained the phenomenon) The intrathoracic pressure causes the veins to compress and this in turn results in significantly reduced venous blood flow into the heart and into the brain. Dizziness, “spots” before the eyes and blackout can ensue. This is one good reason why those with cardiac problems should refrain from all-out straining (as in isometric contraction), and instead should engage in a more rhythmic type of weightlifting technique while breathing normally.
varicose veins: Twisted, widened veins caused by swollen or enlarged blood vessels.
The blood vessels have enlarged due a weakening in the vein’s wall or valves.vein: A blood vessel that returns blood to the heart.velocity: The rate of motion of a body traveling in a given direction.
ventilation: The process of oxygenated the blood through the lungs.vigorous: A level of exercise intensity high enough to yield cardiovascular benefits.

can be classified as water-soluble and fat-soluble.W
warm up: The process engaging in low intensity activities as a means of increasing circulation and body temperature prior to engaging in more strenuous activities or stretching.
weight training: Training exercises that use weight for resistance e.g. dumbbells,
barbells, cable and cam levered equipment.
wellness: A conscious effort or attempt to achieve a state of physical, mental, social,
and spiritual well being.workout: An activity or exercise bout performed for the purpose of improving
health or skill.
work capacity: The ability to perform activities without undue fatigue.work rate: Work performed per unit of time (power).GLOSSARY 323Glossary
