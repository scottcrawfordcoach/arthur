INTRODuCTION
Children and adolescents are natural markets for personal trainers. Many young people
participate  in  competitive  athletics.  They  want  to  achieve  health,  fitness,  and  athletic
success, and their parents support these goals. Children can benefit from the services of a
personal trainer who has specific knowledge about youth fitness and performance, as well
as  more  general  knowledge  of  anatomy,  physiology,  exercise  physiology,  performance
measurement, training, sports psychology, and sports nutrition.

Personal trainers possess an impressive array of training, nutritional, and psychological
tools to help young athletes excel. Unfortunately, coaches in high school and sports clubs
are often poorly trained because of the sorry state of coaching education in the majority
of American colleges and universities. This presents opportunities for personal trainers
to fill the gap and help motivate young athletes to “be the best that they can be” on and
off the playing field.

America  is  faced  with  an  obesity  epidemic  that  includes  our  youth.  The  Centers  for
Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (www.cdc.gov)  report  that  18  percent  of  school-aged
children are obese and that the obesity rate exceeds 20 percent in nine states. Physical
education  programs  in  the  schools  continue  to  remain  underfunded  and  often  are
administered by teachers with little training or practical experience in sports, physical
training,  and  exercise  physiology.  Unfortunately,  many  children  and  adolescents  are
physically inactive; they will benefit from the services of a qualified personal trainer.

Special  youth  populations  also  are  potential  clients.  Children  with  diabetes,  asthma,
spinal cord injury, amputation, mental retardation, or cerebral palsy will benefit from the
services of a knowledgeable trainer. Families of these children may have discretionary
income  that  could  pay  for  your  services.  You  could  help  these  young  people  improve
their physical capacities for sport or for health and well-being.

obesity: Excess bodyfat,
typically defined as a bodyfat
content that exceeds 20 percent
in males and 30 percent in
females.

PrerequISITe Knowledge
Children  are  not  miniature  adults.  You  cannot  use  the  same  training  methods  or
motivational  techniques  on  growing  children  as  you  do  with  mature  adults.  Children
and adults are different anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally.

Anatomy and Physiology
Personal  trainers  must  have  a  thorough  understanding  of  anatomy  and  physiology.
You  should  know  the  major  muscles  of  the  body  and  how  they  work  and  understand
metabolism—how the body converts food energy into other forms of energy the body
uses at rest and during exercise. Know the function and regulation of the lungs, heart,
blood vessels, hormones, brain, and nerves, including the weight control and temperature
regulation systems at rest and during exercise.

Children have immature skeletons. Their bones will not mature until 14 to 22 years of
age, depending on gender and maturational levels. In girls, exercising during childhood
will  critically  impact  bone  health  that  can  last  a  lifetime.  Children  and  adolescents
sustain different types of athletic injuries from adults, and as such, remain particularly
vulnerable  to  growth-related  overuse  injuries  (e.g.,  Osgood-Schlatter’s  disease;
www.osgood-schlatter.com).  Trainers  must  take  great  care  when  using  high  intensity
training methods common in older athletes.

Children  have  immature  temperature  regulation  systems.  They  have  a  large  surface
area in comparison to their muscle mass, which makes them more susceptible to cold
injury. Also, children do not sweat as much as adults do, so they are more prone to heat
exhaustion  and  heat  stroke.  Their  relatively  low  muscle  mass  and  immature  hormone
systems make it more difficult for them to optimally develop speed and power. Breathing
and heart responses during exercise remain much different than in adults, which also
affects their capacity for moderate to high levels of intense exercise.

Motor Development
Growth and development also influence the capacity to learn motor skills. For example,
rapid growth during puberty makes it difficult to achieve stability in basic sports skills.
Early  maturers  will  outperform  late  bloomers—at  least  initially.  In  contrast,  the  late
maturing athlete often outperforms the early maturer in high school, college, or beyond.

Sports skill development in children depends on maturation of the brain and nervous
system, muscles, temperature regulation, and endocrine systems. The personal trainer
should  know  developmentally  appropriate  training  techniques  that  develop  fitness  for
sports without precipitating injuries.

Principles of Training
Changes in training status improve the fitness and capacity of the physiological systems.
Knowledge  of  muscle,  cardiopulmonary,  and  metabolic  physiology  and  how  they
adapt to training is critical for any personal trainer or fitness specialist. Trainers must
understand basic principles of fitness training such as,  overload,  specificity, whole-
body functional training, individual differences, reversibility, periodization, rest,
overtraining,  and  stimulus  variability.  Trainers  also  should  know  how  to  achieve
training effects quickly, efficiently, and without injury.

Osgood-Schlatter’s disease:
Inflammation of the region
where the patellar tendon
inserts into the tibia. This
condition is relatively common
in adolescents.

motor development: How
children develop and learn
motor tasks.

overload: Progressively
increasing exercise stress during
training.

specificity: Body adapts to the
nature of the stressor.

individual differences:
People respond differently to
the same stressors; largely due
to genetic factors.

reversibility: Loss of fitness
gains with removal of the stress
of exercise.

periodization: Cycling
the volume and intensity of
training to maximize the rate of
adaptation.

rest: Amount of time spent
not exercising between sets
or workouts. Rest is essential
for adaptation and should be
incorporated into every training
program.

overtraining: Imbalance
between training and recovery.

stimulus variability:
Changing the nature of the
exercise stress. This may
include varying the intensity
and volume of exercise or
performing different modes of
exercise.

International Sports Sciences Association4  |  Introduction

Development of Health and
Performance Fitness Components
It is difficult to separate health –and performance –related physical fitness. Certainly they
overlap. For simplicity, health –related fitness components include endurance, strength,
muscular  endurance,  flexibility,  and  body  composition.  Performance-related  fitness
includes all of the above in addition to power, agility, speed, balance, and skill. The
skilled personal trainer should understand the physiology of each fitness component and
know training techniques for developing them in children and adults.

Sports Nutrition
Nutrition supplies the energy necessary for growth and fuels metabolism during exercise.
Twenty years ago, the best advice a coach could give a young athlete was to eat a well-
balanced diet containing a variety of foods. This is still good advice. In addition, sports
scientists have developed many nutritional techniques to improve performance. Sports
drinks, dietary composition, nutrient timing, and some dietary supplements can boost
performance under a variety of circumstances. Personal trainers should be able to design
diets for young athletes that address the nutritional needs of growth and also provide the
nutrients to improve performance.

Measurement
Personal trainers should use scientific methods if they want to be effective. This involves
using valid measurement tools to measure weaknesses in fitness and improvements in
the training program. You should know basic tests to assess fitness in terms of both its
health and its performance components, and you should be able to relate these things to
performance in the athlete’s sport. You should also become familiar with the following
basic  statistical  terms:  mean,  standard  deviation,  percentile  rank,  correlation,
and regression.

Motor Learning
Motor learning involves the study of how people learn physical skills. Personal trainers
attempt  to  make  improvements  in  fitness  that  can  be  transferred  to  faster  and  more
powerful sports performances. Strength and power  transfer is not automatic. Simply
increasing the amount of weight an athlete bench presses or squats does not automatically
improve  power  in  football,  track,  or  basketball.  The  newly  acquired  strength  must  be
integrated into the sports movements. Personal trainers should understand how athletes
best learn sports skills and how specific training exercises affect learning them.

Psychology of the Child Athlete
Success in a sport or an exercise program requires dedication and motivation. Personal
trainers can help young athletes succeed by believing in them, helping them focus on
goals,  and  providing  them  with  concrete  methods  to  improve  performance.  Growing
up  is  difficult  for  all  young  people. The  trainer  can  help  the  young  athlete  maintain  a
balanced life.

power: Work per unit of time.
From a practical standpoint,
defined as ability to exert force
rapidly.

agility: Ability to change
directions rapidly.

speed: Ability to move quickly.

balance: Ability to remain
steady and under control from a
moving or stationary base.

skill: Ability to perform a
discrete motor task.

mean: Measure of central
tendency or average.

standard deviation: Measure
of variability used to describe a
set of data.

percentile rank: Percent of
scores falling above and below a
specific point.

correlation: Measure of
the degree of relationship
or association between two
variables such as height versus
weight or maximum arm
strength versus maximum leg
strength.

regression: Process for
determining the extent of
relationship or prediction
between an established variable
(for example, maximum
strength) and one or more
independent variables (for
example, height, weight, arm
length, forearm and biceps
girth).

motor learning: Study of how
people learn physical skills.

transfer: Ability to incorporate
strength or fitness developed
in training to improved
performance in sports skills.

Youth FitnessIntroduction: Personal Training for Youth Fitness and Sports |  5

Most  personal  trainers  get  clients  through  health  clubs,
by word of mouth, or through their private office or home
practice. Finding clients who are young athletes is not much
different,  except  that  most  young  athletes  do  not  belong
to health clubs. They do, however, participate on club and
school  teams.  Your  best  bet  is  to  obtain  the  endorsement
or at least passive cooperation of the coach. People can also
become aware of your services through blogs, Internet sites,
newspaper advertising, bulletin boards, and brochures.

The Brochure
A good brochure is vital to any personal trainer. Handing
out  a  well-produced  brochure  enhances  your  image  as
a  professional  and  will  help  attract  customers  willing  to
spend  money  for  a  quality  trainer.  Your  brochure  should
include your photograph, target population, list of services,
educational  background,  certifications,  and  experience
(athletic and personal training). Be upbeat and emphasize
your strong points. If you have only a high school diploma
but  are  a  champion  bodybuilder  or  fitness  competitor,
emphasize  your  athletic  experience  and  certifications  (if
any). Push your credentials to the max if you have a master’s
degree in exercise physiology or a related field.

Create  your  brochure  or  website  with  a  professional  flair.
Explain your services simply and concisely. Have a rate sheet
available, but do not publish it in the brochure. Distribute
the brochure in places frequented by young athletes or their
parents—sporting goods stores, health clubs, gyms, school
bulletin boards, and on the Internet.

Highly  motivated  parents  are  both  a  boon  and  bane  of
the  trainer.  You  need  parents  to  provide  opportunities  for
young  athletes  such  as  motivating  children,  getting  them
to  practice,  and  hiring  the  services  of  a  personal  trainer.
Nevertheless, the parent-trainer relationship can be difficult
and  counterproductive.  Parents  often  try  to  live  through
their  kids,  which  can  create  unacceptable  or  difficult
circumstances for young athletes.

The  personal  trainer  must  know  enough  about  sports
psychology  to  help  kids  and  their  parents  cope  with  the
stresses of sport. You can help them keep sports in its proper
perspective and ensure that training for athletics remains a
healthy, positive experience.

Prevention and Treatment of
Athletic Injuries
A fine line often separates the improved fitness gained from
training and the breakdown and injury that can be caused
by  overtraining.  The  personal  trainer  must  know  how
much training causes positive adaptation and how much is
excessive.  Injuries  do  occur  in  sports.  Part  of  your  job  as
personal  trainer  is  to  work  around  the  injury  to  maintain
fitness  or  at  least  prevent  deterioration.  You  should  also
know  basic  rehabilitation  exercises  for  major  injuries  and
the role of conditioning in injury prevention.

Personal  trainers  must  also  know  emergency  medical
procedures to be prepared for the unlikely event of a child
suffering from a serious medical condition or sustaining a
serious  injury.  You  must  keep  meticulous  records  of  your
injury  management  procedures  for  each  client  to  protect
yourself from a lawsuit.

recruITIng clIenTS
Most personal trainers work with adults who have money,
discipline,  and  usually  the  motivation  to  exercise.  Adults
want  to  look  sexually  attractive,  thin,  fit,  and  healthy.
Unfortunately,  the  competition  for  adult  clients  is  often
fierce. Why fight the crowd when you can have a specialty
market to yourself? Children and adolescents represent an
untapped market for personal trainers in most communities.
Almost every child participates in competitive sports. Many
kids  and  their  parents  take  sports  seriously  and  want  an
advantage  over  the  competition.  The  personal  trainer  can
help school-age children improve health and fitness and can
make high school athletes more competitive and help them
develop training skills that will foster success in college.

International Sports Sciences Association6  |  Introduction

self-image: How children
perceive themselves.

Relationship with Parents
Parents are the best  link to new clients. Obviously, parents pay the  bills, so you won’t
get far without them. Also, parents often have higher ambitions for their children than
the children have for themselves. The bottom line here is that it is a good idea to get the
parents on your side.

Remember, you are the professional, so you have to draw the line at letting parents tell
you how to do your  job. This requires tact  and  finesse. Overzealous  or  overprotective
parents can negatively affect a child’s progress, self-image, or motivation for training.
The  personal  trainer  must  walk  a  fine  line  between  soliciting  parental  support  and
maintaining independence.

Relationship with Schools
Schools are an excellent source of clients. Many school athletic programs use part-time
coaches and lack continuity from one year to the next or even one season to the next.
The personal trainer can help young athletes develop fitness systematically over a long
period of time.

Personal trainers can also be seen as a threat to the school program, however. Jealousy
from  the  coach,  other  athletes,  or  parents  can  cause  problems. The  trainer  must  walk
a fine line between doing what is best for the child and getting along with the school
administration. You must not ignore the wishes of the coach or school. At the same time,
you probably know training techniques that they are not aware of. If you are not able
to maintain good cooperation with the school, at least try to coordinate your training
program  with  the  school  timetable  to  avoid  overtraining  the  child  or  interfering  with
their sports skill development.

Be aware that schools often restrict their facilities, particularly during school hours. Make
sure you are familiar with local regulations when using facilities for training. Never decide
to just use a facility because it is there! Volunteering as a part-time coach will often allow
you access to school facilities and give you some degree of legal protection.

Youth FitnessIntroduction: Personal Training for Youth Fitness and Sports  |  7

Club Sports
Club  sports  are  common  in  most  parts  of  the  world—particularly  in  Europe  and
South  America.  Poor  sports  programs  in  many  American  schools  have  prompted  the
development  of  well-funded  club  sports  programs  particularly  in  soccer,  gymnastics,
figure  skating,  volleyball,  tennis,  baseball,  swimming,  water  polo,  and  long  distance
running. Sports clubs are a great source of clients. Some trainers work with individual
athletes while others may develop formal relationships with clubs—even to the extent of
becoming the club’s strength and conditioning coach. As with schools, be aware of “turf ”
concerns the club coach might have.

Health Clubs
Gyms  have  built-in  clientele—children  would  not  be  there  if  they  or  their  parents
were not interested in fitness and sports. Some gyms allow outside trainers to use their
facilities, while others will not. Try to establish a formal relationship with several clubs in
town. Even if you have to share revenue, maintaining a good relationship with the best
clubs in town will pay dividends to you in the end.

Working with Unique Populations
Young people with special needs—physical or mental disabilities, asthma, diabetes, or
overweight  and  obesity—remain  a  potentially  lucrative  income  source.  Many  trainers
specialize and center their business on special populations. If you choose this route, learn
as much about the disability as possible from up-to-date textbooks and reliable sources of
information on the Internet. You need special knowledge about how exercise and growth
and development affect the disability.

worKIng wITh clIenTS
You will make the most progress with clients and have the best chance of establishing a
thriving business if you have a plan. This plan includes information about legal and ethical
considerations, a preliminary questionnaire and history, a list of goals and objectives, a
pre-training fitness measurement, the training plan itself, and a re-evaluation.

Legal and Ethical Considerations
Personal trainers are not licensed, so few standards of practice exist. In the event of legal
problems,  however,  a  judge  will  expect  you  to  behave  at  a  level  consistent  with  other
professionals. Working with children poses legal risks not present when working with
adults.  Physically  or  sexually  abusing  children,  or  even  the  hint  of  such  behavior,  can
have serious legal consequences.

You  must  protect  yourself—being  unjustly  accused  of  impropriety  is  little  better  than
actually doing something wrong. The benefit of the doubt will go to the child. You can
minimize  problems  by  always  maintaining  a  professional  demeanor,  not  becoming
overly friendly with clients—particularly of the opposite sex—and documenting training
sessions, evaluations, and training programs. Keep a log and be sure to record the date
and time of workout sessions.

Psychologists describe the phenomenon of transference between coaches and athletes
as physical attraction developed by working closely with each other. Fit young people can

International Sports Sciences Association8  |  Introduction

look like adults and appear sexually desirable. The trainer should remember that the child
is immature and easily swayed by attention from the personal trainer. Be a professional,
and do not become involved with your clients—ever. Even a false accusation can ruin
your life and end your career.

Drug  use  by  young  athletes  represents  another  ethical  issue.  You  do  not  want  to  be
accused of advising young athletes to use illegal drugs such as anabolic steroids or growth
hormone. Nearly five percent of high school athletes use steroids, so it is inevitable that
you  will  work  with  young  people  who  use  these  drugs.  Discourage  drug  use  in  your
clients. Encourage athletes to develop strength, speed, and power naturally without the
aid of illegal drugs. It is acceptable to educate athletes about the risks and benefits of these
drugs, but the trainer should never be perceived as advocating their use.

Insurance
Professional  liability  insurance  is  available  for  certified  trainers.  These  policies  are
usually reasonable and well worth the money. Even defending a groundless lawsuit can
be financially draining. It would be well worth it to consult with a lawyer about what type
of insurance and coverage to purchase.

The Written Questionnaire
The  history  and  goals  questionnaire  is  essential  to  assessing  your  client,  prescribing
the  exercise  program,  and  determining  the  nature  and  intensity  of  training.  Begin
with  a  thorough  medical  history,  including  past  illnesses,  surgeries,  and  medications.
The questionnaire should include background about the parents, including health and
athletic history. Obtain a detailed account of athletic and fitness experiences, including
participation in health clubs, school sports, club sports (e.g., Little League baseball), and
sports camps. Record a physical description of the client that includes height, weight, and
age. Ask for a list of short-term and long-term goals. These forms will be available to you
once you have earned your certified at www.ISSAtrainer.com.

Goals and Objectives
In younger children, the parents may be a source of goals. Young children seldom think
about making the Olympics or professional sports teams on their own. However, they
will have little chance of achieving great success without parental support—particularly
in gymnastics, tennis, golf, figure skating, or alpine skiing. It will be your job to temper
the enthusiasm of parents with the realities of big-time sports—it takes talent, tenacity,
method, technique, and luck to succeed.  Some  children will make  it to  the top, while
most will not. Either way, you must try to make the training experience fun and positive.

Fitness  goals  depend  on  the  sport.  Sports  skills  are  highly  specific.  This  means  that
practicing activities other than the sports skill will not achieve optimal results. One can
develop  fitness—strength,  power,  speed,  endurance,  and  body  composition—that
will  improve  sports  performance.  However,  training  for  fitness  will  never  be  as  good
as  learning  motor  skills.  Analyze  the  requirements  of  each  sport,  then  design  fitness
activities that improve performance. For example, running six miles daily will do little to
improve a football lineman’s performance, while weight training, plyometrics, and
interval training will greatly impact performance.

The exercise prescription or plan is closely related to the formation of goals. Write out
programs in advance. Each workout should have a purpose and should progress naturally

components—fat weight and
fat-free weight.

weight training: Resistance
training using weights (barbells,
dumbbells, weight plates).

plyometrics: Resistance
training technique that uses
muscle stretch followed
immediately by muscle
contraction; an example is
box jumping.

interval training: High
intensity training technique
that varies load, repetition,
distance, and rest using a variety
of exercises such as swimming,
running, and cycling.

into the next session. Build rest periods into the program because planned rest is just as
important as training. The well-structured training program shows an appreciation for
the importance of goal setting and how to achieve those goals.

Pre-Training Measurements
Test basic physical fitness of all clients, regardless of sport. Use a detailed, standardized
form for your clients and try to use the same tests over the years. Tests should include
measurements of body composition, endurance, strength, power, muscular endurance,
flexibility, speed, and agility.

Begin with basic body measurements such as height, weight, age, body circumferences
(chest, waist, arms, calves), and skinfold thickness. Include other valid indices of body
composition measurement such as underwater weighing, bodpod, or bioelectrical
impedance if you have access to them.

Cardiovascular Fitness Tests
Test  cardiovascular  fitness  using  field  tests  such  as  the  step  test,  1-mile  run,  the
12-minute swim test, or the 6-mile bike test—depending on the athlete’s sport. Use the
running test for most athletes. You can also do more sophisticated laboratory tests that
measure maximal oxygen consumption if you have access to the equipment such as the
submaximal bicycle test.

Strength
Measure  strength  using  basic  weight  lifts  such  as  the  bench  press,  squat,  leg  press,
overhead press, dead lift, or power clean. With young athletes, it is best to use five to ten
RM (repetition maximum) tests and avoid maximum singles. You also can do more
sophisticated strength tests if you have access to isokinetic equipment. Good technique
is  essential  to  building  strength  and  preventing  injury.  This  course  includes  a  test  to
assess readiness for learning squats and lifts from the floor (i.e., deadlifts, cleans, jerks,
and snatches).

Muscle Endurance
Muscle  endurance  refers  to  the  ability  to  exert  force  for  an  extended  time  period.
Common measures of strength (push-ups, pull-ups, and sit-ups) really are measures of
muscular endurance. Muscle endurance is important for performing extended workouts
and preventing back pain.

Flexibility
Flexibility  is  the  ability  to  move  a  joint  through  its  full  range  of  motion  or  ROM.
Good flexibility may help to prevent injury and allow athletes to move without hindrance.
Using flexibility assessment tests, such as the sit-and-reach or the V-sit reach, measure
the flexibility of the major joints of the body and compare them with established norms.

Power
Power  is  a  critical  element  for  success  in  athletics—even  endurance  sports.  Measure
power with tests such as the vertical jump test or the power quadrathon test (standing
long jump, bunny hops, 30-meter sprint, and overhead shot throw). Other tests that also
measure upper body power include chest throws and forward throws.

skinfold thickness: Layer
of adipose (fat) tissue just
below the skin surface usually
measured with a caliper at a
specific anatomic location to
describe fatness in that region.

underwater weighing: Body
composition measurement
technique that assesses the
density of the body by water
displacement.

bodpod: Body composition
measurement technique that
measures body volume by air
displacement with conversion
to percentage bodyfat from
body density (body density from
Bodpod = mass/volume)

bioelectrical impedance:
Body composition measurement
technique that measures how
fast a small electric current
passes through the body’s fat
and non-fat tissues.

repetition maximum (RM):
Most weight lifted while
performing a prescribed number
of repetitions. For example,
1-RM is the maximum weight
lifted once.

muscle endurance: Ability
to exert force for an extended
period of time.

flexibility: The ability to move
a joint through its full range of
motion (ROM).

range of motion (ROM): The
distance and direction a joint
can move between the flexed
position and the fully extended
position.

International Sports Sciences Association10  |  Introduction

Speed
Speed  is  the  ability  to  move  rapidly,  and  it  overlaps  with
power.  Tests  of  speed  include  the  20-meter  start  from
blocks,  the  40-yard  (or  meter)  dash,  and  the  100-,  200-,
and  400-meter  dashes.  Speed  tests  can  be  sports  specific,
and  may  include  base  path  sprints  for  baseball  or  softball
players, pool sprints for swimmers, uphill sprints for cross-
country runners, and sled-pulling tests for football players.

Agility
Agility  is  sports  specific—there  is  no  general  measure  of
agility that transfers from one sport to another. However, you
can measure an athlete’s ability to change direction rapidly
using the shuttle run, cone, ladder, and dot assessment tests.

Identifying Problem Areas
from Pre-training Tests
Unfortunately, there are few norms available for measuring
athletic  performance  in  children—except  those  developed

in  school  physical  education  programs.  Develop  your
own  norms  and  use  the  few  norms  available  from
physical  education  professional  organizations.  Top  sports
performances are highly related to basic measures of fitness.
Identify problem areas and incorporate remedial exercises
in  the  training  program.  A  good  way  to  achieve  this  is  to
assess the fitness levels of top athletes. For example, if the
best  football  players  on  the  team  run  the  40-yard  dash  in
five seconds, bench press 250 pounds, and vertical jump 28
inches, then your client should try to beat those marks.

Developing the Training Plan
After  you  have  established  baseline  measurements  and
goals,  it’s  time  to  construct  the  program.  Try  to  outline  a
plan  for  four  to  six  weeks.  The  plan  should  be  structured
and challenging but flexible enough to change if the goals
are too difficult or too easy.

Do not try to prepare your client for the Olympics overnight.
Start  off  conservatively  and  build  fitness  gradually.  This
will  make  the  program  more  enjoyable  and  less  painful.
Gradually  increase  the  volume  and  intensity  of  workouts.
Work on all aspects of fitness. It is better to do only one set
of an exercise that builds speed or agility than to end up not
training  at  all  because  the  athlete  is  too  tired.  Be  creative
and change the training program from one day to the next.
However, do not make the program too complicated. Make
sure  the  athletes  understand  why  they  are  doing  specific
exercises in the program.

Video
Video  provides  a  great  way  to  monitor  progress  and  help
young  athletes  better  understand  how  to  perform  basic
plyometric  or  weight  training  exercises.  Digital  cameras
make it possible to make computer movies of basic sports
movements.  Compare  the  athletes’  movements  with
those seen in Olympic or pro athletes. Identify movement
problems and set out to change them systematically.

Training Diary
All serious athletes and exercise enthusiasts should keep a
training  diary.  This  allows  you  to  record  progress  during
your daily workouts and keep track of how you feel and your
responses  to  various  types  of  exercise.  The  human  body
adapts to the stress of exercise. If the stress is insufficient,
then the athlete will not improve fitness. It is basically that
simple. But if the stress becomes excessive, the athletes will
become injured or overtrained.

Youth FitnessIntroduction: Personal Training for Youth Fitness and Sports |  11

Record Keeping
Keep  a  record  of  each  athlete’s  program  and  any  training
recommendations  you  give.  This  will  help  you  evaluate
progress  and  protect  you  in  the  event  of  a  lawsuit  or
similar  problem.  Also,  good  records  will  help  you  evolve
as a professional. If you have maintained a good computer
database of your clients, you will be better at evaluating and
comparing athletes.

Training Groups or Individuals
Many  drills  and  exercises  work  better  in  small  groups.
Also,  groups  encourage  competition  and  effort.  However,
while competition can be a benefit, it is also the weakness
of  the  group  training  method.  Immature,  physically  unfit,
or overweight and obese kids may benefit from individual

instruction. You can motivate them without any influence
from  their  peers.  Always  prepare  well-structured  and
planned  exercise  sessions.  Behave  like  a  professional  and
you will attract more clients than you can help.

Re-evaluation
Re-evaluation  is  a  critical  part  of  the  training  process.  If
you train and do not do any follow-up, you will not know
if the program is working. Compare the pre- and post-tests
and determine if you reached the short-term goals set at the
beginning of the program. If the athlete did not progress,
change the program so that you see more improvement. Be
systematic, and you can improve the strength, power, speed,
and endurance of anyone.

SuMMARY

Children have immature skeletons and temperature regulation systems, and their
capacity to learn motor skills may be affected by the rapid growth associated with
puberty. Trainers must have a solid understanding of anatomy, physiology, and
the process of emotional maturation in order to effectively help young clients
realize their athletic potential while avoiding sports-related injury and illness.

Youth fitness trainers must also have a firm grounding in the basic principles of
fitness training. They should know the various health and performance related
fitness components and know training techniques for developing each of these
components. They should also have a clear understanding of sports nutrition.
The trainer should be able to design a diet that fuels a child’s healthy physical
development while also contributing to athletic performance. These things, along
with a basic grasp of sports psychology and an ability to prevent and treat athletic
injuries, are all essential for anyone involved in the training of young athletes.

Children and adolescents represent a fertile market for trainers. The competition
for these clients tends to be less intense than for adult clients, and the rewards of
training with young people can be great. Children with special needs represent a
lucrative market for trainers, as well. Trainers should contact parents and schools
and advertise their services online and in the community in order to build a
client base. It is important to have a brochure to distribute that details trainer
qualifications and lists available services.

It is imperative that personal trainers who work with children conduct themselves
professionally. They should be aware of the legal and ethical considerations
involved in any work with young people and also consider purchasing professional
liability insurance.

Setting up the training plan for a young client should include the use of a
history and goals questionnaire, an assessment of pre-training fitness, and the
identification of problem areas. When developing a training plan, it is best to
outline a program for four to six weeks. It should be challenging but flexible
enough to change if the goals are too hard or too easy. The use of video can
be an excellent tool in helping young athletes and should be used along with
training diaries and clear records of each athlete’s program to evaluate progress.
It is critical to re-evaluate the client at the end of each phase of the program
to determine whether or not the program is working. If the athlete has not
progressed, the trainer can change the program to get more improvement.

adolescence: Period of physical
and psychological development
from the onset of puberty to
maturity.

Children are not miniature adults. The personal trainer must take into consideration the
growth process when designing and prescribing an exercise program for young clients.
Children’s sports and games are extremely popular throughout the world and children
deserve knowledgeable, professional coaches and trainers to work with them. Personal
trainers and the administrators of youth fitness programs should become familiar with
the characteristics and exercise responses of growing children.

The challenges presented by exercise to growing children and mature adults may appear
similar, but in reality they are based on fundamentally different mechanisms. The child’s
immature  temperature,  regulatory,  skeletal,  and  nervous  systems  are  often  unable  to
tolerate  the  same  level  of  physical  stress  as  the  mature  adult’s.  Young  children  cannot
learn  motor  skills  as  rapidly  as  adults  or  achieve  the  same  degree  of  physical  fitness.
During adolescence, however, potential improvements in exercise capacity may exceed
those of any other time of life.

Exercise  is  important  during  growth.  It  contributes  to  a  better  developed  functional
capacity  and  can  enhance  neural  and  musculoskeletal  development.  Exercise  habits
established during childhood and adolescence carry over to adulthood. The United States
is in the midst of an obesity epidemic. Numerous studies show that overweight children
become overweight or obese adults. Exercise habits established during the school years
may help prevent a lifelong problem with obesity and weight control.

Physical performance in children and adolescents must always be assessed in light of the
growth process. Growth involves a series of remarkably similar developmental stages in
all people. Individual differences in diet, exercise, and health may affect these stages to a
certain extent, but the basic pattern remains the same. Each stage profoundly influences
individual  capability  for  physical  performance.  Attempts  to  rush  the  developmental
process are futile and may lead to physical and emotional harm.

We  will  examine  the  relationship  between  growth,  exercise  capacity,  and  physical
training. The unit emphasizes the importance of exercise during growth and the relative
importance of environmental and genetic factors in determining physical performance.

ExERCISE AND gROWTh
An  understanding  of  exercise  and  growth  requires  a  basic  knowledge  of  the  growth
process.  Children  gradually  develop  a  readiness  (learning  capability  based  on
physiological maturation) for specific motor skills (sports skills) and types of exercise.
This readiness depends on neurological, cardiovascular, and psychosocial development.
The following discussion focuses on the physiological aspects of development that affect
physical performance.

The naTure oF The growTh ProceSS
Growth  involves  the  transformation  of  nutrients  into  living  tissue.  It  involves  the
development  of  the  organism  in  an  orderly  fashion  and  represents  a  predominance
of  anabolic  (building)  over  catabolic  (breakdown)  processes.  Growth  involves  the
progressive transformation of the organism into the adult form.

Growth proceeds along an irregularly shaped curve. During the first two years of life,
height and weight increase rapidly. This is followed by a progressively declining growth
rate during childhood. At puberty, an abrupt increase occurs in the growth rate. This
is called the adolescent growth spurt. All people adhere to the basic growth curve, but
individual differences in environment can affect the rate of change in height, weight, and
physiological development.

growTh durIng chIldhood
During  childhood  (i.e.,  the  period  between  about  two  years  of  age  and  the  onset  of
puberty),  a  steady  but  gradual  increase  takes  place  in  height  and  weight,  with  height
increasing faster than weight. Males tend to be taller and heavier than females; however,
females have relatively longer legs, which indicates a greater level of maturity (the focus
of growth progresses from head to feet, so greater leg length indicates further progression
on the growth curve). The growth rate is faster in males, yet the relative changes remain
similar in both sexes. The skeletal age of girls is more advanced throughout childhood.
Between the ages of 6 and 10 years, girls gain in pelvic width faster, while boys tend to
have larger thoraxes and forearms. Although there are some sex differences in growth
during childhood, the main physical characteristics (i.e., height, weight, and body size)
stay almost the same until puberty.

The  gradual  growth  rate  during  childhood  is  conducive  to  learning  motor  skills.  The
relatively constant ratio between height and lean body mass provides a stable environment
for developing coordination and neuromuscular skill. This is an important time period
for introducing and developing gross motor activities such as running, jumping, hopping,
and throwing. Limited muscle mass and fragile bone growth (epiphyseal) centers make
vigorous  strength  training  less  appropriate  (with  the  exception  of  physical  skills  that
require the use of body weight as the resistance).

growTh aT PuberTY and adoleScence
Adolescence is the final period in the growth process before maturity. It is a time of rapid
increases in height and weight and is accompanied by puberty, the stage when sex organs
develop fully. The adolescent growth spurt generally begins at about 10 to 13 years in girls
and 12 to 15 years in boys. Ten to thirteen-year-old girls are often taller than males of the
same age. But following the male adolescent growth spurt, boys generally catch up and
then surpass the girls. (Refer to Figures 1.1 and 1.2).

menstrual cycle.

epiphyseal growth plate:
Part of a long bone where bone
growth occurs.

long bone: One of the long
bones of the extremities,
consisting of a tubular shaft
(diaphysis) and two ends
(epiphyses) usually wider than
the shaft.

articular: Referring to a joint.

epiphysis: The end of a long
bone that is originally separated
from the main bond by a layer
of cartilage but later becomes
united to the main bone
through ossification.

diaphysis: Shaft of a long
bone.

ossification: Formation of
bone involving the conversion of
cartilage into bone.

Because  puberty  and  the  growth  spurt  occur  at  the  same  time,  the  degree  of  sexual
maturation  often  determines  position  on  the  growth  curve.  In  girls,  the  growth  spurt
generally  occurs  when  the  breasts  and  pubic  hair  first  appear.  This  is  followed  by
menarche, the first menstruation. Menarche provides a definite maturation landmark
that does not occur in boys. The closest indicators of maturity in boys, in addition to
pubic hair, are the appearance of facial hair and the change in voice.

Adolescent growth characteristics differ in late and early maturers. The rate of growth is
more intense the earlier the growth spurt occurs. Boys who mature earlier often become
more muscular, with shorter legs and broader hips. Girls who mature earlier have shorter
legs and narrower shoulders. Late maturers tend to become slightly taller adults. Even
though the growth spurt is less intense in late maturers, they continue growing over a
longer period of time.

The  characteristic  sexual  differences  in  anthropometric  (physical)  measures  arise
during puberty. Males develop greater height and weight with larger musculature and
broader  shoulders,  while  females  develop  larger  hips.  The  most  noticeable  physical
change during the growth spurt is an increase of slightly more than three inches in height
a year for girls and about four inches in height a year for boys.

The  adolescent  growth  spurt  profoundly  impacts  physical  performance.  Males  make
marked improvements in endurance, strength, speed, power, and various motor skills.
Females,  in  contrast,  often  experience  a  leveling  off  in  skills.  The  Canadian  Health
Measures Survey, a study comparing changes in fitness and body composition in 1980
and  again  from  2007  to  2009,  found  large  decreases  in  female’s  strength  and  aerobic
capacity and increases in measures of body fat following the growth spurt.

SKeleTal changeS durIng growTh

Skeletal  growth,  principally  in  the  long  bones,
causes  increases  in  height.  Bone  growth  occurs
at  the  epiphyseal  growth  plates,  located  at
both ends of long bones between the articular
epiphysis  and  the  central  diaphysis.  (Figure
formation,  called  ossification,
1.3)  Bone
continues  until  the  growth  plates  close.  Linear
growth  can  continue  as  long  as  the  ossification
centers remain open. The union of bone growth
centers  begins  at  puberty  in  some  bones,  but  is
not complete until the age of 18 or later. (Figures
1.4 and 1.5)

Exercise,  which  stresses  bones  and  stimulates
bone  growth,  does  not  seem  to  enhance  linear
bone growth but does increase bone density and
width. Exercise during growth creates a skeleton
composed of denser, stronger bone that is better
able  to  withstand  stress.  Disease  or  trauma  can
injure  the  growth  plates,  which  could  affect
growth. For this reason, it is extremely important
to avoid situations that may damage these sensitive
anatomic regions. Excessive baseball pitching by
youngsters  can  cause  epiphyseal  damage;  heavy
weight  lifting,  particularly  when  unsupervised,
can produce the same undesirable effect.

Body  composition,  or  the  ratio  of  fat  to  fat-free  weight,
plays an important role during growth because overweight
children tend to become overweight adults. Regular physical
activity  is  vital  to  ideal  body  composition  maintenance.
Obese youngsters tend to be less physically active than lean
children,  and  diminished  activity  patterns  tend  to  persist
throughout life. In contrast, programs of vigorous physical
activity can reverse the process.

Increases in body fat occur because of increases in fat cell
size, fat cell number, or both. Fat cells increase in number
(cell  hyperplasia)  until  early  adolescence.  Thereafter,
increased body fat occurs mainly by increased cell size (cell
hypertrophy).  Once  developed,  fat  cells  can  only  decrease
in size, not in number. This may explain the dismal success

rate for long-term weight control in obese adults. It may be
possible to limit the development of fat cells during growth
by  means  of  diet  and  physical  activity.  Failure  to  impact
cellular growth of fat cells could result in a lifelong excess
body fat problem.

During  childhood,  females  possess  slightly  more  body  fat
than  males  do.  Body  fat  percentages  are  about  16  percent
for 8-year-old boys and 18 percent for 8-year-old girls. At
puberty, marked changes in body composition occur. Lean
body  weight  increases  rapidly  in  boys,  thereby  decreasing
the  percentage  of  body  fat. The  percentage  of  fat  typically
declines  by  three  percent  to  five  percent  between  ages  12
and  17.  Females  also  experience  increases  in  lean  mass
(though less of an increase than boys) and increases in body

pubertal growth spurt:

fat. The body weight of an untrained 17-year-old female typically consists of about 25
percent fat. In contrast, a female athlete often possesses less than 18 percent fat.

Physical  activity  does  not  change  the  essence  of  these  growth-related  stages  of  body
composition.  In  girls,  for  example,  vigorous  training  will  not  prevent  the  increase  in
body fat that occurs during adolescence, but the gains will be less than in sedentary girls.
Studies comparing active and inactive youngsters show that supervised physical training
consistently results in higher lean body mass and lower body fat. These advantages do not
persist into adulthood without continued training. Physical inactivity decreases muscle
mass and increases body fat.

Body  composition  plays  an  important  role  in  motor  skill  development.  The  relatively
slow but important growth period coincides with increased opportunities to learn gross
motor skills. These efforts may be compromised if the child is overweight. Weak muscles
have considerable difficulty overcoming the burden of excess body mass.

muScle growTh and
PhYSIcal PerFormance
Muscle growth accounts for a considerable portion of gains in body weight during growth.
Steady growth of muscle tissue occurs during the first seven years of life, followed by a
slowing trend in the years immediately preceding puberty. In the healthy child, muscle
and skeletal growth keep pace with one another. During the pubertal growth spurt,
muscle grows at a rapid rate, particularly in boys. The increase in muscle tissue typically
occurs slightly after the greatest increases in height. This explains the awkwardness of
children of this age.

In  boys,  the  increases  in  muscle  size  coincide  with  improvements  in  muscle  strength.
On  the  average,  rapid  increases  occur  at  about  14  years  and  continue  throughout
adolescence. (Figures 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8) However, considerable individual differences are
attributable to maturational level, body build, and amount of physical activity. Increased
muscle strength and size are of considerable concern to children because they represent
the most important predictors of athletic success.

The  extent  of  the  development  and  performance  of  muscle  depends  on  the  relative
maturation of the nervous system. High levels of strength, power, and skill do not occur

if  the  child  has  not  reached  neural  maturity.  Myelination  of  nerves  is  not  complete
until  sexual  maturity  has  been  achieved,  so  an  immature  child  cannot  be  expected  to
respond to training or reach the same level of skill as an adult. Myelin is a fatty sheath
that surrounds the nerve that helps to transmit nerve impulses faster.

In boys, significant training-induced muscle hypertrophy (increase in muscle size) does
not  occur  until  adolescence.  This  is  because  of  the  low  testosterone  levels  present  in
sexually  immature  children.  Testosterone—along  with  growth  hormone,  insulin,
and insulin-like growth factors—are important regulators of protein synthesis. Adult
males  have  about  ten  times  more  testosterone  than  pre-pubertal  children  and  adult
women. Maximal strength-gaining potential in young people does not occur until they
achieve adult levels of testosterone. However, pre-pubertal children can improve strength
considerably  through  resistance  training.  Such  practices  are  safe  and  beneficial  when
training sessions are supervised to avoid maximum lifting. Gender differences in strength
also may be partially attributed to the higher number of muscle cell nuclei in males. The
nucleus is the genetic control center of the cell that directs the formation of new proteins.
Males probably have a greater capacity for muscle hypertrophy (and thus muscle strength)
because of the critical role that muscle cell nuclei play in protein synthesis.

Resting and maximum heart rate progressively decline during childhood and adolescence.
Resting (average daily) and maximal exercise heart rates tend to be identical in girls and
boys during childhood, but are about three to four beats higher in females during and
after adolescence. At puberty in boys, submaximal exercise and recovery heart rates are
lower than in girls, even in the absence of vigorous training. The decreased heart rate is
accompanied and perhaps caused by a greater resting and exercise stroke volume from
increased heart size and blood volume.

Resting  and  exercise  systolic  blood  pressure  rise  progressively,  particularly  during
puberty. blood pressure assumes adult values shortly following the adolescent growth
spurt. The pubertal acceleration in blood pressure occurs in females before males, but the
boys quickly catch up and surpass the girls.

Exercise  capacity  and  maximal  oxygen  consumption  (in  liters  per  min)  increase
gradually  throughout  childhood.  Maximal  oxygen  consumption  expressed  per  unit  of
body  weight  (mL/kg)  is  higher  in  children  than  adolescents  or  adults,  which  reflects
problems  using  weight  regressed  oxygen  consumption  in  children.  During  puberty,  a
dramatic increase occurs in boys and levels off in girls. The improvements in endurance
capacity occur because of increased muscle mass and enhanced oxygen-transport and
metabolic capacities.

Prepubertal  youngsters  do  not  respond  to  endurance  training  as  well  as  adolescents
and adults. Some studies show no improvement in maximal oxygen consumption from
training beyond that expected in normal growth. There may even be a difference between
children and adults in the way each adapts to training. For example, studies using interval

of the course, maximal oxygen consumption is only one element of endurance. Power
and cell metabolism are also important.

The  training  threshold  may  be  higher  in  immature  children.  Prepubertal  youngsters
have a limited ability for cardiac hypertrophy and metabolic enzyme synthesis, both
important factors in improving endurance performance. Low testosterone levels may be
the cause. Testosterone is a potent stimulator of muscle hypertrophy, protein synthesis,
and red blood cell production. These factors have important effects on oxygen transport
and the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

The  pubertal  increase  in  maximal  oxygen  consumption  corresponds  to  the  time  of
the greatest increase in height. At the same time, androgen secretion in boys increases
dramatically, which results in hypertrophy of cardiac muscle, stimulation of red blood
cell (RbC) and hemoglobin production, and proliferation of metabolic enzymes. A
vigorous endurance training program accelerates these changes.

geneTIc conSIderaTIonS
Are champions made or born? The question of the relative contribution of environment
and genetics has been highly controversial for more than 60 years. If children are subjected
to proper training at a young age, will they attain a higher level of performance than if
they begin later in life? Researchers are starting to find the answers to these questions.

Determination of the genetic component of performance usually involves comparison
of  identical  and  nonidentical  twins.  Because  identical  twins  possess  the  same  genetic
material,  environmental  considerations  account  for  performance  variability.  A
combination  of  genetic  and  environmental  factors  explains  variability  in  nonidentical
twins.  Most  of  these  studies  indicate  that,  in  the  absence  of  physical  training,  the
genetic component is the most important factor in determining individual differences
in  performance.  In  relatively  sedentary  populations,  little  if  any  difference  persists
in  maximal  oxygen  consumption  between  identical  twins,  while  the  differences  in
nonidentical twins remain considerable.

Genetic studies are important because they emphasize the trained state as a temporary
level of adaptation. Training studies with identical twins demonstrate that the active twin
improves while the sedentary twin does not. But when the levels of physical activity are
similar, heredity asserts itself and physiological characteristics in the genetically identical
individuals move closer together.

The  adaptability  of  the  human  body  is  limited.  Data  from  the  Heritage  Family  Study
showed that children and adults differ in their capacity to adapt to exercise—there are
responders  and  non-responders.  Maximal  oxygen  consumption,  for  example,  can  be
improved by a maximum of about 20 percent. Thus, an athlete must start out with a high
oxygen transport capacity if he or she is ever to reach Olympic levels of performance.
Studies of the characteristics of top athletes seem to reinforce this.

Can champion athletes be selected at a young age? The top few athletes during childhood
do  tend  to  become  top  athletes  in  adolescence  and  adulthood.  However,  except  in
these cases, prediction of superior athletic prowess is tenuous. Hard work and years of
dedication are as important as genetic predisposition. It is best to provide a wide range of
activities to all and provide extra help for those who show interest and talent.

SuMMARY

The growth process is similar in all people and must be considered when
assessing exercise capacity and designing training programs. The growth curve
follows an S shape, with rapid increases in height and weight occurring during
the first two years, followed by a declining growth rate during childhood and
an accelerated rate during puberty. During childhood, the relative changes
remain similar in both sexes, although girls tend to be more mature than boys.
The gradual growth rate during childhood is conducive to learning gross
motor skills.

Adolescence is a period of rapid growth during which the child attains sexual
maturity. Males, who attain puberty later than females, develop greater height
and weight with larger musculature and broader shoulders, while females
develop larger hips. Males experience large improvements in all areas of physi-
cal performance, while females tend to level off in most areas. The reasons for
these sex differences in performance seem to be based as much in sociology as
physiology. Adolescence is a critical period for the development of many types
of physical abilities.

Exercise appears to be an important component for optimal skeletal
development. Trauma can cause injury to the bone growth centers and affect
growth. Exercise caution when prescribing activities that are potentially
dangerous to these bone growth centers.

Preventing obesity is particularly important during periods of rapid growth
because fat cells proliferate during these times. Regular exercise and proper
nutrition during growth may help to retard fat cell development and thus serve
as a positive factor in lifelong weight control and obesity prevention.

Exercise physiology is similar for children and adults. Performance depends upon how
quickly and efficiently the body uses energy during exercise. The personal trainer who
works with young people should understand the importance of metabolism in exercise
performance and appreciate the striking differences between children and adults.

The  body  is  involved  in  a  constant  balancing  act.  It  must  balance  the  rate  at  which  it
builds up and breaks down tissues while providing ample energy for the many physical
processes that sustain life. It breaks down foods to supply energy, but also stores energy
in  the  liver,  fat  cells,  or  muscle  for  later  use.  Metabolism  refers  to  the  sum  of  these
chemical processes that occur in the body.

Exercise, transporting blood, and breathing require energy. You need energy to destroy
worn out cells and tissues and build new ones. Without energy from metabolism, you
could not run, throw a ball, lift weights, or go for a walk. Metabolic energy is required
to regulate body water balance, transmit nervous signals, and fuel thought processes. In
children, metabolic energy also fuels growth and tissue development.

Physical fitness refers to the capacity to increase metabolism and meet the demands of
physical effort. Exercise increases the metabolic rate—the harder one exercises, the
more it accelerates. Humans at rest have a low metabolic rate; the metabolic rate increases
with standing and rises more when walking. When jogging, the metabolic rate increases
to more than 800 percent above its resting rate. Olympic caliber distance runners and
cross country skiers can increase metabolism by a whopping 2000 percent or more. Fit
children can increase metabolism 10 to 15 times above the rate of their metabolism at
rest.  While  it  is  notable  that  children  increase  oxygen  consumption  faster  than  adults
at the onset of exercise, this is functionally insignificant because children are physically
smaller and have less muscle mass.

Physically fit people excel at “metabolic management.” They can rapidly supply energy
for  powerful  movements  and  maintain  healthy  physical  systems.  In  contrast,  unfit
people cannot generate the energy needed for powerful or sustained exercise. They are
subject to an array of physically deteriorating diseases. Their bodies cannot cope with

substances produced during intense physical activity, and they tire easily. Consequently,
their legs hurt, and they breathe heavily even walking up a flight of stairs. Recreational
activities  such  as  soccer  or  tennis  are  difficult  or  impossible  because  individuals  lack
basic physical stamina.

Muscle power also closely relates to the capacity to increase metabolic rate. Power refers
to the rate at which you can exert force. It relates to muscle size, the rate at which the
nervous system can activate the muscles, muscle coordination, and how chemical factors
within  muscles  withstand  fatigue.  Children  have  a  limited  ability  to  develop  muscle
power  because  of  the  immature  nature  of  their  nervous  and  hormonal  systems  and
smaller muscle size.

ENERgY MANAgEMENT AND ExERCISE
Machines work by converting one form of energy to another. The automobile engine,
for example, works by transforming chemical energy (gasoline) into mechanical energy
(movement  of  pistons).  The  human  body  works  in  a  similar  way.  It  takes  chemical
energy from food and converts it into other forms of energy useful to the body, such as
mechanical work. These energy conversions allow the body to contract muscle, conduct
nerve impulses, and renew structures like bone cells and muscle proteins.

Almost every type of food, from a simple sandwich to a health food bar, contains energy.
Digesting  the  food  and  releasing  all  the  energy  would  be  wasteful  because  the  body
cannot use all of the energy at once. Instead, the body stores energy in forms it can use
more gradually. Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, represents the most basic form of
storage energy. (Figure 2.1)

International Sports Sciences Association30  |  unit 2

ATP represents the “energy currency” of the cell—it supplies energy for the majority of the
body’s physiological processes. Rather than use the energy released from foods directly,
the body “traps” energy as ATP. When the body needs energy for muscle contraction,
making new proteins, or controlling fluid levels in the cells, it breaks the ATP molecule
down  to  release  the  stored  energy  in  the  bonds  that  hold  the  ATP  molecule  together.
This released energy then fuels all biological process, from muscle contractions during a
bench press or a golf swing, to expelling water from sweat glands when exercise begins.

Foods are classified as fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. After a meal, the body stores
excess  energy  not  used  to  create  ATP.  Fats  are  stored  in  adipose  tissue  (fat  cells).
Carbohydrates in the diet help to maintain blood sugar (glucose), or they are stored as
the larger molecule glycogen. Glycogen, stored mainly in the liver and skeletal muscles,
is  an  important  carbohydrate  for  supplying  energy  during  all  forms  of  exercise,  from
light to strenuous. Amino acids, the basic building block units that construct proteins,
are  not  stored  as  fuel.  Rather,  they  form  the  many  protein  structures  throughout  the
body  like  enzymes,  hormones,  and  muscles. They  can  also  be  degraded  for  energy  or
incorporated into carbohydrate or fat energy stores.

Fats, carbohydrates, and proteins also can be broken down later to form new ATP and
accommodate increases in metabolic rate. At the beginning of exercise, the body’s need
for  ATP  increases  tremendously.  Consequently,  the  tissues  mobilize  the  energy  stores
to  increase  ATP  production.  These  processes  are  identical  in  children  and  adults,  but
children have lower metabolic capacities.

exercISe and The Three energY SYSTemS
The  body  has  three  energy  systems  to  carry  out  life  processes:  immediate,  non-
oxidative,  and  oxidative.  These  systems  also  perform  specific  functions  during
different intensities of exercise. The immediate energy system provides for activities that
last three seconds or less. Examples include weight lifting, jumping, swinging a tennis
racquet or golf club, spiking a volleyball, or throwing a discus. The non-oxidative system
operates  during  speed  events  which  last  from  3  to  60  seconds,  such  as  the  100-  and
400-meter runs. The oxidative system provides energy for events lasting more than two
minutes, such as distance running, swimming, hiking, and most team sports (e.g., soccer,
water polo, field hockey, baseball, basketball, and ice hockey).

Except  for  short  power  events  like  weight  lifting,  the  body  engages  all  three  energy
systems concurrently. For example, when you play tennis, you use the immediate energy
system when hitting the ball, but replenish energy stores using the non-oxidative and
oxidative systems.

The Immediate Energy System
The components of this system include ATP and creatine  phosphate (CP). During
exercise,  ATP  breaks  down  and  releases  energy  used  to  contract  muscles.  The  body
does not contain very much ATP, so the stores are replenished immediately by breaking
down CP. During even the most intense exercise, ATP levels remain high, but CP levels
deplete rapidly. After a few seconds, you reach the maximum capacity for this system
and have to use the non-oxidative and oxidative energy systems to restore ATP and CP
levels. Switching to the other energy systems becomes crucial because the muscles would
stiffen (a condition called rigor) and become unusable if ATP ran out. (Figure 2.2 on
page 31 and Table 2.1 on page 32)

carbohydrate: Major energy
providing substrates including
starches, sugars, cellulose and
hemicellulose. All carbohydrates
contain carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, and are usually divided
into two fractions—structural
(fiber) and non-structural (sugars
and starches).

glucose: Chemical found in
many foods, especially fruits.

energy for living organisms. The
hormone insulin controls its use.

muscles.

Figure 2.2 Creatine phosphate is used to resynthesize ATP.

The Non-oxidative Energy System
This  energy  system  makes  new  ATP  by  breaking  down  blood  sugar  (glucose)  and
glycogen stored in the muscles and liver. It does not require oxygen, which is why it is
sometimes called the anaerobic system (anaerobic means without oxygen). The capacity
of this energy system is also limited, but it can generate considerable ATP in a brief time.
This makes it the most important energy system for intense but limited duration exercise.

There are two problems associated with the non-oxidative energy system: (1) carbohydrate
stores  are  limited,  and  (2)  rapid  use  of  the  system  produces  metabolic  chemicals  that
cause fatigue. Your brain and nervous system rely on carbohydrates to function properly.
Low blood sugar leads to dizziness, rapid fatigue, and poor judgment. During intense
prolonged exercise, such as playing three to four sets of tennis for three to four hours,
carbohydrate stores deplete rapidly, making it difficult to continue.

Children store less glycogen than adults do, but at the same time, they cannot generate
as much power during exercise. This explains why carbohydrate depletion presents less
of a problem during exercise in children than in adults, (Table 2.1.). Prepubertal children
have a lower anaerobic capacity and rely more on aerobic metabolism during exercise
than adults. Their glucose regulatory system is immature, making them rely more on fat
as a fuel. During intense exercise, muscle and blood lactate levels are lower in children
than in adults. The relative use of fats and carbohydrates assumes adult characteristics as
children age.

Intense but short duration exercise, which relies on the non-oxidative system for energy,
increases lactic acid production. While lactic acid is an important fuel in the body, it
releases substances called hydrogen  ions that interfere with metabolism and muscle
contraction. During intense exercise like sprinting, you produce a considerable amount
of  lactate  and  hydrogen  ions  that  might  be  linked  to  fatigue.  Fortunately,  exercise
training helps the body cope with high levels of hydrogen ions and lactic acid. Children
produce  less  lactate  than  adults  because  they  have  smaller  muscles  and  lower  power
output capacities.

lactic acid: Syrupy, water-
soluble liquid (C3H6O3)
produced in muscles from
anaerobic glucose metabolism.

hydrogen ion: Hydrogen
atom minus its electron and
therefore carrying a positive
charge. The pH—an important
measure of acid-base balance—
is the negative logarithm of the
hydrogen ion concentration.
High or low levels of hydrogen
ions interfere with chemical
reactions in the body.

oxygen: Gas making up
approximately 21percent of the
atmosphere and that is essential
for cell respiration—the energy
producing reactions in the cells.

cardiorespiratory system:
Relating to the heart and lungs
and their functions.

mitochondria: Small organelle
found inside the cell responsible

The Oxidative System
The oxidative system (also called the aerobic system because it uses oxygen) requires
oxygen to generate ATP. While it cannot produce energy for exercise as fast as the
two other energy systems, it can supply energy for a longer duration. Consequently,
for activities lasting more than a few minutes, the oxidative system becomes critically
important.

For this energy system to work effectively, the body must extract oxygen from the air and
deliver it to the cells. Oxygen is transported to the cells through the blood stream via the
cardiorespiratory system. This system requires healthy lungs to move the oxygen into
the body, and a strong, healthy heart to pump the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to
the cells. Exercise training increases the heart’s capacity to pump blood and, to a certain
extent,  the  capacity  of  the  lungs  to  move  oxygen  from  the  environment  to  the  blood
stream. Children have limited abilities to transport oxygen to exercising muscles because
immature hearts and lungs cannot take up and move oxygen in the body the way adult
organs can.

When the oxygen reaches the cells, it is transported to specialized cell structures called
mitochondria. The mitochondria, called the powerhouses of the cell, produce most of
the  body’s  ATP.  Mitochondria  contain  highly  specialized  enzymes  that  drive  chemical
reactions that extract energy from the foods we consume. This energy captured as ATP
drives muscle contractions, makes new protein, and works in literally thousands of other
cellular functions. Skeletal muscle in children has a high capacity for oxygen consumption,
but oxygen consumption is limited by lower cardiac output and muscle mass.

In any given sport, one of the energy systems will be more important than the others.
For example, weight lifters rely on the immediate energy system, sprinters depend on
the  non-oxidative  system,  and  endurance  runners  and  cyclists  predominantly  rely  on
the oxidative system. The child’s exercise program should emphasize use of the energy
system most important to his or her fitness goals.

develoPIng meTabolIc FITneSS
Metabolic fitness refers to energy provided to the muscles in a specific type of exercise.
For example, to improve a child’s ability to run fast over short distances (i.e., sprint), the
metabolism must be trained to supply substantial energy in a short time. If the goal is to
develop better endurance for hiking or backpacking, then the training program should
train the body’s metabolism to supply energy over a more sustained time period.

Youth FitnessMetabolism  |  33

Physically fit people are highly efficient at generating ATP
and  managing  metabolism,  and  can  thus  exercise  longer
and more intensely. Exercise training enhances the elements
essential to ATP production. The principles are the same for
children and adults.

When  designing  a  training  program,  you  must  consider
the  ultimate  fitness  goal.  Exercises  that  develop  oxygen
metabolism  tend  to  render  health  benefits.  You  would
emphasize  exercises  that  develop  oxidative  metabolism  if
your client wanted to be a better hiker or distance runner.
If  a  client  were  interested  in  power  sports  like  softball,
throwing  activities,  or  soccer,  then  you  would  emphasize
the faster energy systems during training. (Table 2.2)

Most  people  should  devote  time  to  training  each  energy
system.  No  sport  or  exercise  relies  completely  on  one
system. The tennis player needs endurance to play for the
entire match and sufficient strength to hit powerful shots.
The  weight  lifter  must  have  strength  to  lift  the  weights
and endurance to workout for one to two hours. Likewise,
distance  swimmers  require  good  endurance  and  must
possess enough speed and power to swim fast. Individuals,
regardless of their favorite sport, need both cardiovascular
and power fitness for good health.

Fitness for Movements Lasting
Less than Three Seconds
Almost any motion fits into this category. If you stand up
from  your  chair,  you  use  the  immediate  energy  system  to
supply the energy for numerous muscle actions that allow
you to stand up. You use the immediate energy system when
you  throw  a  softball  as  far  as  you  can.  Maximum  effort
lasting only a few seconds requires maximum activation of
the immediate energy system. Systematic exercise training
accomplishes three goals. It: (1) increases high-energy fuel
stores, (2) enhances the enzymes for breaking them down,
and (3) improves the nervous system’s ability to turn muscles
“on.”  This  latter  type  of  fitness  is  particularly  valuable  for
throwing events (i.e., discus, shot put, hammer, and javelin),
baseball or softball pitching, and weight lifting.

To develop the capacity for powerful movement, you must
perform exercises that specifically overload this component.
Even for repetitive events such as downhill skiing or tennis,
you need the muscle power to perform each movement. For
example,  the  young  athlete  might  make  twenty  or  thirty
turns  when  skiing  downhill,  but  he  needs  good  power  to
execute each turn.

interval training: High
intensity training technique
that varies load, repetition,
distance, and rest using a variety
of exercises such as swimming,
running, and cycling.

You  develop  the  immediate  energy  system  by  engaging  in  exercises  that  develop  high
levels  of  muscle  tension.  Research  suggests  that  merely  having  high  levels  of  strength
is  not  enough  for  powerful  movements.  You  must  develop  the  capacity  to  exert  force
rapidly during very specific movements. Training for these activities includes resistance
training, plyometrics, short sprints (i.e., starts), and body weight exercises.

Fitness for Sports and Exercises Lasting Three
Seconds to Two Minutes
These movements emphasize the non-oxidative energy system by training the muscles
to  generate  substantial  power  for  short  bursts  and  quick  recovery. This  type  of  fitness
is  valuable  in  tennis,  football,  basketball,  volleyball,  soccer,  softball,  field  hockey,  and
downhill skiing. In these sports, the other energy systems are also important and should
also be trained.

Fitness  for  this  metabolic  component  is  best  developed  through  interval  training.
Interval training involves repeated bouts of high intensity exercises. Usually, a short rest
occurs between each exercise repetition. Fitness is highly specific—one must overload
the  body  so  it  adapts.  For  example,  train  with  cycling  intervals  to  improve  fitness  for
cycling  and  swimming  intervals  to  swim  faster.  This  type  of  fitness  is  also  intensity
specific. If the goal is to run faster for 800 meters, you will not improve much if you run
repeated 800-meter runs at a slow pace or jog slowly for longer distances. The bottom line
is this—train fast if you want to move fast.

Fitness for Sports and Exercises Lasting More
Than Two Minutes (Endurance Exercise)
As  exercise  duration  increases,  the  body  begins  to  rely  more  on  the  oxidative  energy
system. This requires lungs that can deliver oxygen to the blood stream and eliminate
carbon dioxide and help to control fatiguing hydrogen ion levels. The body requires a
strong heart and blood vessels to transport blood rapidly to its trillions of cells. And
you must have a well-developed chemical system within the cells to process fuels and
oxygen rapidly.

The most important benefit of endurance exercise is its ability to improve the capacity
of the heart, lungs, and circulatory system to deliver oxygen to the body’s tissues. In a
fit  individual,  the  heart  pumps  more  blood  per  beat,  blood  volume  increases,  resting
and  submaximal  exercise  heart  rate  slows,  the  number  or  red  blood  cells  increases,
blood  supply  to  the  tissues  improves,  and  resting  blood  pressure  decreases.  A  fit
cardiorespiratory system does not have to work as hard at rest and at low levels of exercise
because it functions more efficiently. A trained heart can also better withstand the stresses
and strains of daily life and meet the occasional emergencies that make extraordinary
demands on the body’s cardiorespiratory resources.

The best measure of the body’s capacity to deliver and use oxygen is maximal oxygen

the air during intense exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. The
VO2max will be
discussed in more detail in the next unit of the course.

Endurance  training  also  develops  cell  mitochondria.  This  cellular  structure  processes
oxygen and fuels to produce ATP. Endurance exercise increases the size of this cellular
component which helps you use more fat as fuel and consume more oxygen.

VO2max  and  mitochondrial  capacity,
While  there  is  considerable  overlap  in  training
specific types of exercise work best to promote each one. Interval training best develops
.
VO2max.  Generally,  the  time  of  the  interval  is  1  to  5  minutes  of  intense  exercise.  For
.
example,  a  runner  attempting  to  increase
VO2max  might  run  eight  intervals  of  400
meters at 90 percent of maximum capacity. A swimmer might swim eight intervals of
100 meters at 90 percent. Depending on the given child’s fitness level, each interval might
take 60 to 200 seconds.

.
Scientists discovered that
VO2max depends not only on muscle power but also on the
capacity of the heart and lungs to transport oxygen. Problems with chemical processes
within muscle that limit muscle power can cause fatigue and limit the heart and lungs’
ability  to  deliver  oxygen  to  the  tissues.  Muscle  power  and  oxygen  transport  capacity
should  be  developed  at  the  same  time  so  the  individual  can  sustain  high  intensities
during endurance exercise.

Mitochondria capacity can be developed by over-distance training or through interval
training. Over-distance training has sometimes been called “long-slow-distance” or LSD
training.  This  type  of  training  involves  prolonged  exercise  lasting  anywhere  from  10
minutes to several hours. Over-distance training must be specific to the sport—runners
should run, cyclists should cycle, swimmers should swim, and wrestlers should wrestle.

METAbOLISM AND
ThE YOuNg PERSON
Developing a robust metabolism is critical for any young person. Young athletes require
metabolic fitness to optimally convert the energy in food nutrients into energy the body
uses  for  muscle  contraction.  More  importantly,  all  growing  children  need  to  develop
metabolic fitness to set the stage for a healthy life. Studies show that metabolic problems
that are now epidemic in adults—obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes—
begin during childhood. Regularly performed exercise and good nutrition are the two
best things children can do to develop metabolic health that carries over into adulthood.

Metabolic fitness is central to success in sports. The successful sprinter, football player,
soccer  player,  swimmer,  gymnast,  or  ballet  dancer  can  convert  chemical  energy  into
mechanical energy quickly and efficiently. The more energy the child can generate, the
greater the power production.

You  must  develop  metabolic  fitness  slowly—taking  into  consideration  the  child’s
maturational  level,  experience,  motivation,  and  talent.  Do  not  become  a  slave  driver.
Instead, try to get the child to enjoy the process of training. Ultimate success in sport
requires self-discipline. The child will never reach high levels of performance unless he
or she has a burning desire to train and improve. Youth specialists should help young
athletes develop this attitude.

Most children will never reach elite sports levels. Part of your responsibility is to make
sports and physical activity enjoyable and fun. Teach them the skills necessary to train
efficiently and effectively for the rest of their lives. Instill in them a real love for physical
activity. Achieve this, and you give the child the gift of wellness that will provide dividends
well into adulthood.

Metabolism refers to the sum of the physical and chemical processes that occur in the body. Physical fitness
refers to the capacity to increase metabolism and meet the demands of physical effort. Children increase oxygen
consumption faster than adults at the onset of exercise. This is functionally insignificant because children are
physically smaller and have less muscle mass. The body has three energy systems to carry out life processes:
immediate, non-oxidative, and oxidative. The immediate energy system provides for activities that last 3 seconds
or less. Examples include weight lifting, jumping, swinging a tennis racquet, spiking a volleyball, and throwing a
discus. The non-oxidative system is used for speed events, which last 3 to 60 seconds. Examples include 100- and
400-meter runs. The oxidative system provides energy for events lasting more than 2 minutes, such as distance
running, swimming, hiking, and most team sports (e.g., soccer, water polo, baseball, basketball, and ice hockey).
The child’s exercise program should emphasize use of the energy system as the most important to the individual’s
fitness goals. Developing a robust metabolism is critical for any young person. Young athletes need metabolic
fitness to optimally convert the energy in food nutrients into energy the body can use for muscle contraction.
More importantly, all growing children need to develop metabolic fitness to set the stage for a healthy life.

At  rest,  the  cardiovascular  system  in  the  healthy  young  person  has  little  difficulty
supplying oxygen and fuels to the body’s tissues and removing waste products. During
exercise,  the  demands  on  this  system  increase  considerably.  Oxygen  delivered  to  the
working  muscles  increases  with  exercise  intensity.  The  body  accomplishes  this  by
increasing cardiac output, directing blood to working muscles and vital area —such as
the heart and brain—and directing blood away from inner organs and inactive muscles.
Blood is also directed toward the skin surface to dissipate internal heat produced by the
body during exertion.

The  capacity  of  the  cardiovascular  system  to  transport  oxygen  to  working  muscles  is
critical  in  determining  performance  levels  in  endurance  exercise.  The  body’s  ability
to  transport  and  use  oxygen  during  exercise  is  limited.  Remember,  this  limit  is  called

Several important differences exist between adults and children in terms of cardiovascular
function. Children do not breathe as much air during exercise as adults do. Their breathing
frequency  is  greater  during  exercise,  but  their  volume  per  breath  or  tidal  volume  is
less. Children have higher resting and maximal heart rates than adults. Young children
may  have  maximum  heart  rates  in  the  220-beat-per-minute  range;  maximum  heart
rates in adults rarely exceed 205 beats a minute. Children have smaller stroke volume
(blood pumped by each ventricle per heart beat). Children also have less muscle mass,
so they cannot develop as much muscle power as adults. Finally, children have immature
temperature regulatory systems, so compared to adults, they are more susceptible to heat
injury (heat exhaustion and heat stroke).

consumption: Maximum
amount of oxygen delivered

This  unit  of  the  training  course  discusses  the  responses  of  the  cardiovascular  system
to  exercise  and  the  effects  of  training  on  cardiovascular  function.  The  cardiovascular
responses to exercise are the same in children and adults—except as noted in the
previous paragraph.

ThE PuLMONARY SYSTEM
AND ExERCISE
The  pulmonary  system  includes  ventilation  (a  process  by  which  the
lungs and heart work together to bring air into the lungs), diffusion
of oxygen and carbon dioxide across microscopic lung air sacs
called  alveoli,  and  movement  of  blood  through  the  lung
(called  pulmonary  perfusion  or  lung  blood  flow).  These
functions—ventilation, diffusion, and lung blood flow—are
closely linked. They work together to: (1) deliver oxygen to
the blood, (2) rid the blood of carbon dioxide (CO2), and (3)
control metabolic acids. (Figure 3.1)

Ventilation
Ventilation involves the movement of air in and out of the lungs and is quantified in terms
of liters per minute. The volume of each breath is called tidal volume, and the number
of breaths per minute is called breathing frequency. The purpose of ventilation is to
replace oxygen taken up by the blood and eliminate CO2 that moves into the lungs from
the blood.

Ventilation patterns in children differ from those of adults at rest and during exercise.
Children  have  a  higher  breathing  frequency  and  lower  tidal  volume.  Children  reach
adult  levels  for  ventilation  at  approximately  16  to  18  years  of  age.  However,  younger
children who train for endurance will develop adult-type ventilation patterns in which
breathing frequency decreases, while tidal volume increases.

also called dyspnea.

angina: Heart pain associated
with the heart muscle’s not

nerves release norepinephrine as
the neurotransmitter.

norepinephrine:
Catecholamine neurohormone,
the major neurotransmitter of
the sympathetic nervous system.
It is stored and released from the
adrenal medulla.

Diffusion
Diffusion refers to the spontaneous migration of substances from regions where their
concentration is high to regions where their concentration is low. Children have a lower
lung diffusion capacity than adults because their lungs are not fully developed.

Lung Blood Flow
(Pulmonary Perfusion)
Lung  blood  flow  depends  on  the  heart’s
pumping capacity. Children do not pump
as  much  blood  as  adults,  limiting  their
ability to oxygenate the blood at the lungs.
However,  they  also  are  smaller  in  size,  so
their lung function is appropriate for their size.

Matching Ventilation
and Lung Blood Flow
Specialized centers in the brain closely match breathing and lung blood flow, coordinating
heart and lung function during exercise. Lung disease, heart disease, or a dramatic change
in altitude can disrupt this coordination and cause shortness of breath (also known as
dyspnea) or chest pain called angina. Children are not immune to lung or heart disease;
regular exercise is often a good way to detect possible cardiovascular problems.

ThE hEART, bLOOD vESSELS,
AND ExERCISE
The heart is a four-chambered organ consisting of two atria (top chambers) and two
ventricles  (bottom,  main  pumping  chambers).  The  right  heart  pumps  blood  to  the
lungs, while the left heart pumps blood to the rest of the body.

The heart pumps blood into an irrigation system of blood vessels consisting of arteries,
capillaries, and veins. Arteries are large muscular blood vessels. As they approach the
tissue, they can become larger (vasodilation) or smaller (vasoconstriction), which
helps direct blood flow to specific tissues. In the capillaries, oxygen, “metabolic” fuels,
and hormones enter tissues, while waste products exit tissues. Blood returns to the heart
via the veins. The veins contain about two-thirds of the body’s blood (Figure 3.2).

Blood  flow  control  occurs  in  the  brain.  The  brain  coordinates  special  centers  that
regulate  breathing,  heart  rate  and  contraction  strength,  body  movements,  skin  blood
flow and temperature  regulation, and metabolism. Blood flow control also occurs
in  the  tissues  themselves.  If  an  athlete  does  10  reps  of  curls,  for  example,  local  tissue
changes will increase blood flow to the biceps.

The system’s number one priority is maintaining blood pressure. During intense exercise,
the brain directs blood away from working muscles to preserve blood pressure control.
One  of  the  purposes  of  exercise  training  is  to  ensure  that  the  body  maintains  blood
pressure while directing as much blood as possible to the working muscles. This principle
is the same in children and adults.

cardIovaScular reSPonSeS To exercISe
The heart and blood vessels respond to the metabolic demands of exercise by increasing
blood flow to active areas and decreasing blood flow to less critical areas. The six principal
cardiovascular responses to exercise are:

1.  activation of the “fight-or-flight” system, or sympathetic nervous system,
the system that releases the stress hormones norepinephrine and epineph-
rine (also called noradrenaline and adrenaline);

2.

increased cardiac output (heart output) that results in increased oxygen and
fuel delivery and increased CO2 and waste removal in active skeletal muscles
and the heart;

3.

increased skin blood flow to help remove heat;

4.  decreased blood flow to the kidneys that results in less urine formation;

5.  decreased visceral (internal organ) blood flow that results in reduced diges-

tion and glandular secretion; and

6.  maintenance of blood flow to the brain.

epinephrine: Adrenal hormone
that increases systemic vascular
resistance and improves
coronary and cerebral blood
flow. It increases myocardial
electrical activity and strength
of contraction, stimulates
carbohydrate metabolism, and
increases heart muscle oxygen
requirements and automaticity.
It plays an important part in the
body’s response to danger and
arousal.

cardiac output: Amount the
heart pumps each minute. It is
determined by stroke volume
and heart rate.

visceral: Refers to the internal
organs.

International Sports Sciences Association42  |  unit 3

systolic: Active or pumping
phase of the cardiac cycle.

diastolic: Relaxation phase of
the cardiac cycle.

The  cardiovascular  responses  to  physical  activity  depend  on  the  type  and  intensity  of
exercise.  Dynamic  exercise  requiring  a  large  muscle  mass—such  as  running—causes
the  greatest  response  from  the  cardiovascular  system.  Cardiac  output,  heart  rate,  and
systolic blood pressure increase, while little change occurs in diastolic blood pressure.
Strength exercises, such as weight lifting, markedly increase systolic and diastolic blood
pressure and heart rate.

Oxygen consumption increases in proportion to exercise intensity until it plateaus near
.
VO2max, further increases in
maximal effort (Figure 3.3). After the body has reached
exercise intensity do not lead to a further increase in oxygen consumption. Very little
variability  exists  between  the  oxygen  consumption  of  trained  and  untrained  people
performing at the same power output or exercise intensity. If a world-class cyclist and
a  sedentary  person  ride  a  bicycle  at  the  same  speed,  their  oxygen  consumption  will
be similar. The ride represents a lower percentage of maximum for the cyclist, but the
oxygen cost remains the same.

Figure 3.3 Oxygen Consumption Versus Exercise Intensity. Oxygen consumption increases with
exercise intensity until the person reaches a ceiling in the capacity of the heart to pump blood and the cells
ability to use oxygen. This point is called maximal oxygen consumption.

Heart Rate
Heart rate is the most important factor in increased cardiac output during exercise. In

.
consumption, levelling off at
VO2max. In children, heart rate increases from a resting
value of approximately 70 to 90 beats a min to a maximum heart rate of 200 to 220
beats a minute or more. The rate and extent of the increase depend on the type of exercise,
and the fitness, age, and sex of the person.

maximum heart rate: Highest
rate the heart can reach—usually
during exercise—in one minute.

Youth Fitness

Cardiovascular & Pulmonary Exercise Physiology  |  43

During  submaximal  exercise,  heart  rate  rises  and  then  levels  off  when  the  oxygen
transport  requirements  of  the  activity  have  been  satisfied.  At  increasing  intensities,
this leveling off in heart rate takes longer and is more difficult to achieve. In prolonged
exercise, the heart rate increases steadily at the same work rate. This phenomenon, called
cardiovascular drift, is caused by a diminished capacity to return blood to the heart
because  of  decreased  plasma  volume  (due  to  filtration  and  sweating)  and,  perhaps,
decreased  sympathetic  tone  (nerve  control  of  blood  vessels).  Cardiovascular  drift
results from a decrease in stroke volume, so that the heart rate must increase to maintain
cardiac output and blood pressure at the same level.

At rest and during low intensity submaximal exercise, heart rate may be elevated above
normal  due  to  factors  such  as  anxiety,  dehydration,  ambient  temperature,  altitude,
and  digestion.  Resting  heart  rates  of  over  100  to  130  beats  a  minute  are  not  unusual
before anxiety-producing situations, such as treadmill tests and sports competitions—
particularly in children unaccustomed to high stress situations.

Heart  rates  tend  to  be  lower  during  strength  exercises—such  as  weight  lifting—than
during  endurance  exercises,  such  as  running.  During  resistance  exercises  like  weight
lifting, the heart rate increases in proportion to the muscle mass used and the percentage
of  maximum  voluntary  contraction.  Thus,  a  dynamic  lift—such  as  a  clean  and  jerk
performed  with  heavy  weights—increases  the  heart  rate  more  than  a  one-arm  biceps
curl using minimum resistance.

At  the  same  absolute  power  output  (exercise  intensity),  heart  rate  is  higher  during
upper  body  exercise  (i.e.,  arm  ergometer)  than  it  is  during  lower  body  exercise  (i.e.,
.
VO2,
bicycle  ergometer).  In  addition,  upper  body  exercise  results  in  a  higher  level  of
systolic and mean arterial pressures, and total peripheral resistance. The greater
circulatory  load  probably  results  from  the  smaller  muscle  mass,  a  greater  isometric
exercise  component,  and  a  less  effective  muscle  pump  (resulting  in  decreased  venous
return). Heart rate can be valuable in creating an individual’s exercise prescription. By
measuring the heart rate either during or immediately after exercise, one can estimate the
metabolic cost of the activity.

cardiovascular drift:
Tendency for the heart rate to
increase gradually with time
during exercise.

plasma: The fluid (noncellular)
portion of the circulating blood.

plasma volume: The volume
of plasma in circulating blood.

sympathetic tone: Signals
sent from the sympathetic
nervous system to the blood
vessels that keep them partially
closed at rest or during
submaximum exercise.

power output: Intensity of

mean arterial pressure: One
third of systolic pressure plus
diastolic pressure. Most people
have a mean arterial blood
pressure of 100 mm Hg.

resistance to flow of blood in
the systemic circulation. It is
determined by dividing mean

stroke volume: Volume of

.
VO2max  and
increases  during  exercise.  It  increases  steadily  until  about  25  percent  of
then levels off or decreases. After peak stroke volume has been achieved, cardiac output
increases because of an increase in heart rate.

Stroke volume is one of the most important factors that accounts for individual differences
.
VO2max  and  cardiovascular  capacity.  This  is  readily  apparent  when  comparing  a
in
sedentary  man  with  a  champion  cross-country  skier.  Both  men  have  maximum  heart
rates of 185 beats a minute, yet the maximum cardiac output of the untrained man is
16.6 liters a minute, while the maximum cardiac output of the skier is 32 liters a minute
(nearly double). The maximum stroke volumes of the skier and the sedentary man equal
173 and 90 ml.

arteriovenous oxygen
difference: Difference in
oxygen content between the
arteries and the veins.

Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference ((a-V)O2)
Arteriovenous  oxygen  difference measures oxygen extraction by the tissues from
blood.  Oxygen  extraction  increases  as  a  person  transitions  from  rest  to  maximum
exercise. Oxygen extraction reaches almost 100% when (a-V)O2 difference is measured
across a maximally exercising muscle.

Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and the tissues’ resistance to blood flow,
or  peripheral  resistance.  It  is  vitally  important  that  blood  pressure  increases  during
exercise. Blood flow must be maintained in the critical heart and brain areas to satisfy
the blood requirements for working muscles and skin.

During exercise, blood vessels that supply nonworking tissues experience vasoconstriction
(where  they  close  or  get  smaller)  while  vessels  supplying  working  muscles  experience
vasodilation (where they become larger). This causes an overall decrease in peripheral
resistance.  Though  peripheral  resistance  decreases  during  exercise,  blood  pressure
increases. This occurs because of the overwhelming increase in cardiac output.

Systolic blood pressure rises steadily during exercise from about 120 mm Hg at rest to
180  mm  Hg  or  more  during  maximal  exercise.  In  children,  maximum  systolic  blood

Youth FitnessCardiovascular & Pulmonary Exercise Physiology  |  45

pressure rarely exceeds 160 mm Hg. Blood pressure in children and adults follows the
same general trend as heart rate.

Diastolic pressure changes little during exercise in normal children and adults. Typically,
either no change or a slight decrease of less than 10 mm Hg occurs during exercise; a
small decrease of less than 4 mm Hg occurs during recovery. A significant increase in
diastolic pressure (greater than 15 mm Hg or above 110 mm Hg) is a warning sign of
heart disease.

Blood Flow
Blood is redistributed from inactive to active tissues during exercise. Critical brain and
heart tissues are spared the vasoconstriction that occurs in other body areas.

Resting  blood  flow  to  the  spleen  and  kidneys  averages  about  2.8  liters  a  minute.  It
reduces to about 500 ml during maximal exercise. Sympathetic stimulation (sympathetic
innervation is particularly potent in these organs) and the circulation of “fight-or-flight”
hormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, cause the markedly reduced blood
flow in these regions.

In  the  kidneys,  reduced  blood  flow  during  exercise  is  accompanied  by  post  exercise
proteinuria  (protein  in  the  urine)  and  occasionally  by  hemoglobinuria  and
myoglobinuria (hemoglobin and myoglobin in the urine). Extremely active teenagers
will sometimes fail athletic physicals because of protein in the urine. This finding should
not be of concern and will settle down if the child takes a few days off from exercise.

Skin  blood  flow  increases  during  submaximal  exercise,  but  decreases  again  as  skin
temperature cools and exercise becomes more intense. The relative skin blood flow (as
a  percentage  of  cardiac  output)  changes  little  during  exercise.  Peripheral  perfusion  of
cutaneous vessels during exercise, particularly in the heat, contributes to cardiovascular
drift and fatigue during endurance exercise.

Blood flow to the heart’s coronary arteries increases with increasing exercise intensity. A
large coronary artery reserve is extremely important because it provides adequate blood
flow  even  in  the  face  of  significant  coronary  artery  disease.  Coronary  artery  blood
flow is not thought to limit oxygen transport capacity in people without coronary artery
disease.  A  moderately  intense  warm-up  several  minutes  before  endurance  exercise  is
important for increasing blood flow during the early stages of exercise.

Endurance  training  produces  adaptive  changes  in  many  aspects  of  cardiovascular
function. The heart improves its ability to pump blood mainly by increasing its stroke
volume. This occurs due to increased blood entering the chamber and a small increase in
the strength of the heart muscle.

Endurance or aerobic exercise is best for improving the capacity of the cardiovascular
system. Such exercise requires the use of at least 50 percent of the body’s muscle mass in
rhythmical exercise, performed for at least 15 to 20 minutes, three to five days a week,
.
VO2max. Considerably more training is required to
and at above 50 to 60 percent of
develop the high levels of fitness characteristic of endurance athletes.

Adaptation  to  endurance  training  is  specific.  Swimming  improves  cardiovascular
performance in that activity but will not improve endurance in running. This principle
is critically important in multi-endurance triathlons; successful triathletes must practice
cycling, running, and swimming.

Interval  training—repeated  bouts  of  short-  to  moderate-duration  exercise—also
improves cardiovascular condition. This mode of training manipulates distance, speed,
repetition,  and  rest.  Interval  training  allows  the  athlete  to  train  at  a  higher  intensity
than typically employed during competition, and thus serves as an overload. This type
of training optimizes the development of cardiovascular capacity yet is less effective in
eliciting  the  biochemical  changes  critical  for  fatigue  resistance.  Endurance  athletes
should practice interval and over-distance training.

condition, type of training, and age. Most studies find that
VO2max can improve only
about  20  percent.  It  appears  that  an  athlete  must  be  endowed  with  a  relatively  high
capacity  oxygen  transport  system  to  be  successful  in  endurance  events.  This  is  not
to  say  that  training  is  not  extremely  important,  but  rather  that  there  is  only  a  limited

opportunity to improve the maximal aerobic capacity or

Heart Rate
Endurance training reduces the resting heart rate. It is not unusual to see resting heart
rates of less than 40 beats a minute in champion endurance runners. Children experience
a decreased heart rate with endurance training, but not to the same extent
as adults.

Training  also  decreases  the  heart  rate  during  submaximal  exercise.  The
metabolic  requirement  of  the  workload  remains  the  same  (once  the
movement patterns have been learned), but the decline in heart rate does
not reduce cardiac output because of an increase in stroke volume.

Training has a small effect on maximal heart rate, usually decreasing it by
about three beats a min. Maximum heart rate remains relatively stable, but
tends to decrease only with age. It can serve as a reference point for judging
the relative intensity of exercise. For example, suppose a person achieved a
heart rate of 140 beats a minute running a 10-minute mile. The person then
returned after six months of endurance training and ran another 10-min

mile, only this time the heart rate achieved only 130 beats
a  minute.  The  workload  no  longer  represented  the  same
percentage  of  maximum  heart  rate  (which  remained  the
same). The heart rate decreased at an identical submaximal
exercise intensity, yet running speed would have to increase
to achieve the same relative intensity of exercise.

Stroke Volume
Endurance  training  increases  the  heart’s  stroke  volume  at
rest  and  during  submaximal  and  maximal  exercise.  Most
studies  indicate  that  training  increases  stroke  volume
by  no  more  than  about  20  percent,  the  same  percentage

change as is in
VO2max. World-class runners, cyclists, and
cross-country skiers with exceptional stroke volumes were
probably born that way.

The  training-induced  increase  in  stroke  volume  is  due
largely to a decreased heart rate because the heart has more
time  to  fill  up.  Also,  more  blood  volume  causes  a  larger
stroke volume. Finally, the stronger heart can pump more
blood per heartbeat.

pressures  during  exercise.  Diastolic  and  mean  arterial—
but  not  systolic—blood  pressures  are  reduced  at  maximal
exercise. The mechanism of reduced blood pressure at rest
remains unknown.

Blood Flow
With  training,  coronary  blood  flow  usually  decreases
slightly  at  rest  and  during  submaximal  exercise  due  to  a
decreased heart rate. Coronary artery blood flow increases
at maximal exercise with training to support the metabolic
requirement of increasing cardiac output. Coronary artery
blood  flow  accommodates  the  metabolic  load.  Training
does not increase blood vessels that supply the heart muscle.

Endurance  training  increases  blood  vessels  in  skeletal
muscles, which aids in the transport of oxygen, metabolic
fuels, and waste products in the exercising muscles. During
maximal exercise, muscle blood flow increases by about 10
percent  after  training  because  of  a  greater  cardiac  output
and increased muscle blood vessels.

Endurance training does not affect skin blood flow, but skin
vessels receive increased blood during exercise along with
an  earlier  onset  and  increased  sweat  rate.  This  helps  the
body cool itself during exercise.

SuMMARY

During the transition from rest to exercise, there is an increase in cardiac output,
an increased blood flow to active muscles and the heart, maintenance of blood
flow to the brain, and decreased blood flow to most of the body’s internal or-
gans. Training increases cardiac output, stroke volume, maximum muscle blood
flow, and blood and plasma volume. It slows resting and submaximal exercise
heart rate. Training improves the regulation of the cardiovascular system, which
makes it easier to supply oxygen, metabolic fuels, and hormones, and rid the
body of waste products and heat.

During exercise, children do not breathe as much air as adults. Their breathing
frequency is greater during exercise, while tidal volume or volume per breath is
less. Children have higher resting and maximal heart rates than adults. Young
children can achieve maximum heart rates greater than 220 beats a minute,
while adults rarely attain 205 beats a minute. Children have a smaller stroke
volume, or amount of blood pumped by each ventricle per heart beat. Children
also have less muscle mass and cannot develop as much muscle power as adults.
Finally, children have immature temperature regulatory systems, so they are more
susceptible to heat exhaustion and heat stroke than adults.

Children can train with weights and gain strength and some
muscle  size.  However,  children  should  not  begin  formal
weight training too early. If a young person is not willing to
train two to three days a week, the activity will provide little
benefit. Most children do not have the discipline to train on
a regular basis. Forcing them to do so will only make them
despise the activity. Build up the training ethic gradually so
young athletes become self motivated.

Children  can  perform  exercises  and  play  games  that  build
strength.  Children  who  can  handle  their  bodyweight  on
playground bars are setting the stage for more serious strength
training in the future. Personal trainers who work with young
people should understand how muscles increase in strength
and  size—even  though  many  children  will  not  train  with
weights.

Until recently, scientists knew relatively little about the best
ways to increase muscle strength and size. Athletes were on their own—whatever seemed
to work entered into practice. Scientists did not have the tools to study the way muscles
grew; the technology simply was unavailable. That all changed in the 1960s and 70s with
the electron microscope, muscle biopsy techniques, and radioactive tracers that allowed
scientists to view the ultrastructural details of the muscle from the inside.

Today,  scientists  know  a  lot  about  the  way  muscles  become  stronger  and  increase  in
size. New technologies and the opening up of the former communist eastern bloc sports
medicine laboratories have added immensely to our knowledge about muscle and how
best  to  train  muscle.  If  you  systematically  apply  the  incredible  amount  of  sports  and
exercise  science  information  available  to  you,  your  clients  will  make  gains  far  greater
than you ever believed possible.

elasticity, and (4) specific skill development. Each factor depends on the others for peak
muscular development. Muscles develop best when subjected to tension. The neural and
elastic properties of muscle, in addition to muscle protein, ultimately allow for fast and

muScle STrucTure and STrengTh
Muscles move the body and enable it to exert force because they move the skeleton. When
a muscle contracts (shortens), it moves a bone by pulling on the tendon that attaches
the  muscle  to  the  bone.  Muscles  consist  of  individual  muscle  cells  or  muscle  fibers
connected in bundles. A single muscle consists of many bundles of muscle fibers covered
by layers of connective tissue that bind the fibers together. Muscle fibers, in turn, consist
of  smaller  units  called  myofibrils.  When  the  muscles  receive  the  signal  to  contract,
protein filaments within the myofibrils slide across one another, causing the muscle fiber
to  shorten.  Weight  training  causes  the  size  of  individual  muscle  fibers  to  increase  by
increasing  the  number  of  myofibrils.  Larger  muscle  fibers  mean  a  larger  and  stronger
muscle. hypertrophy refers to the development of large muscle fibers (see Figure 4.1).

Muscle fibers, classified as fast-twitch or slow-twitch, vary according to their strength,
speed of contraction, and energy source. Slow-twitch fibers are relatively fatigue resistant,
but they do not contract as rapidly or strongly as fast-twitch fibers. The aerobic system is
the principle energy system that fuels slow-twitch fibers. Fast-twitch fibers contract more
rapidly and forcefully than slow-twitch fibers but fatigue more quickly. Although oxygen
plays an important role in the energy system that fuels fast-twitch fibers, these fibers rely
more on anaerobic metabolism than do slow-twitch fibers.

motor unit: The functional
unit of muscular contraction
consisting of a motor nerve and
the muscle fibers it innervates.

Most muscles contain a mixture of slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers. The type of fiber that
goes into action depends on the type of work required. Endurance activities like jogging
tend to use slow-twitch fibers, whereas strength and power activities like sprinting use
fast-twitch fibers. Weight training can increase the size and strength of both fast-twitch
and slow-twitch fibers, although fast-twitch fibers are preferentially increased.

To exert force, the body recruits one or more motor units to contract. A motor  unit
consists of a nerve connected to a number of muscle fibers. The number of muscle fibers
in a motor unit varies from two to hundreds. When a motor nerve calls on its fibers to
contract, all fibers contract to their full capacity. The number of motor units recruited
depends on the amount of strength required. When a person lifts a light weight like 5
pounds, he or she uses fewer motor units than when lifting a heavier 10-pound weight.
Weight training improves the body’s ability to recruit motor units—a phenomenon called
muscle  learning,  which  increases  strength  even  before  muscle  size  increases.  Muscle
learning  represents  an  important  way  to  gain  strength  during  childhood  because  low
testosterone levels make it difficult to significantly increase muscle size.

In summary, weight training increases muscle strength by increasing the size of individual
muscle fibers and improving the ability to activate motor units to exert force (See Figure
4.3 on page 55).

hYPerTroPhY or hYPerPlaSIa?
For  over  100  years,  scientists  have  argued  about  whether  or  not  strength  training
increases muscle fiber number or only muscle fiber size. Most studies show that strength
training  makes  muscle  fibers  larger  (hypertrophy),  not  more  numerous  (hyperplasia).
However, there is some proof that muscle fibers can increase in number under certain
circumstances. Also, some extremely strong people may be born with more muscle fibers
than others. Generally, though, it is muscle hypertrophy that makes muscles stronger.

how muScle FIberS
become bIgger
Muscle  fibers  become  bigger  by  increasing  the  number  of
myofibrils—in other words, muscles increase in size by adding
protein.  As  the  number  of  myofibrils  increase,  both  muscle
strength and muscle size increase. The more myofibrils added
to  the  muscle,  the  greater  the  increase  in  strength  and  size
(Figure 4.2).

Protein Synthesis
The cell nucleus serves as the master control center for protein
production in muscle cells. Most cells in the body contain a
single nucleus. Muscle cells, in contrast, contain many nuclei,
which  give  them  a  high  capacity  to  produce  new  proteins.
Proteins are constructed from amino acids on cell structures
called  ribosomes.  The  nucleus  sends  a  message  to  the  ribosomes  telling  them  exactly
how to arrange the amino acids to form a specific protein. The cells also manufacture
proteins such as enzymes. Enzymes play important roles in cell function and physical
performance. Four factors influence protein production in muscle: (1) muscle tension,
(2) hormones, (3) amino acid concentration, and (4) nutritional status.

Myofibrils Showing the Sarcom-
eres—the basic unit of the fiber.

Youth FitnessMuscle Physiology  |  53

Muscle tension
Muscle  tension  is  the  most  important  factor  in  increasing
the  rate  of  muscle  protein  development.  Muscle  tension
speeds the movement of amino acids into the muscle and
triggers the nucleus to build new muscle. The faster amino
acids move into the muscle, the greater the rate of muscle
protein  synthesis.  In  other  words,  optimal  muscle  growth
depends on triggering tension receptors in the cell, and on
the  rate  at  which  amino  acids  enter  the  cell.  Any  training
program  designed  to  stimulate  muscle  growth  should
maximize the intensity and duration of muscle tension.

Hormones
Testosterone,  growth  hormone,  and  insulin  are  the  three
most  important  hormones  that  affect  protein  synthesis  in
muscle. Each of these hormones influences muscle cell nuclei
and their messengers, causing them to speed the production
of  muscle  proteins.  Insulin  also  speeds  the  movement  of
amino  acids  into  the  muscle  cell.  Most  amino  acids  enter
muscle cells by a process called the sodium pump. Insulin
speeds the action of the sodium pump, which increases the
rate of amino acid transport into the cell. This is critical for
muscle growth—the more amino acids transported into the
muscle cell, the greater the rate of muscle hypertrophy.

Other hormones cause protein breakdown. Among the most
important of these are the corticosteroids produced by the
adrenal glands (hormone secreting glands that lie on top of
each kidney). Corticosteroids, such as cortisol, are produced

during times of stress. They increase after a hard workout or
during periods of overtraining. With overtraining, the blood
level of these hormones rises, and the testosterone level falls.
This imbalance produces a catabolic state in which gains in
muscle size are impossible.

Amino Acid Concentration
and Nutritional Status
Optimal  amino  acid  transport  requires  an  adequate
concentration  of  amino  acids  in  the  blood  and  muscles.
Usually,  this  is  not  a  problem  because  most  athletes
consume  enough  protein  in  their  diets  to  supply  the
muscles with adequate amino acids. However, during heavy
training, extensive soft tissue injury, or overtraining, amino
acid  concentration  may  be  inadequate.  Energy  intake  is
also important. If active, growing children do not consume
enough  total  calories  and  their  bodies  will  break  down
structural proteins for energy.

Anabolic-Catabolic Cycles
Training  does  not  lead  to  continuous  gains  in  muscle
size.  Muscle  size  increases  for  a  while,  then  levels  off,
and  sometimes  regresses.  This  occurs  because  of  protein
turnover—the constant buildup and breakdown of structural
proteins.  If  you  provide  an  optimal  training  environment
for  the  muscles  (i.e.,  good  muscle  tension  during  training
and ideal concentrations of anabolic hormones and amino
acids),  then  muscles  will  tend  to  hypertrophy  because  the

body remains in an anabolic or growing phase. If training and nutritional considerations
are suboptimal, then training gains will be less, and you may actually lose ground.

The  goal  of  the  training  program  should  be  to  remain  in  an  anabolic  state  and  avoid
catabolic periods. Older children who are serious about strength training can optimize
tension in the workout by incorporating cycles. Intense workouts increase muscle size,
but adequate rest is essential for intense training. People who push to failure every time
they train will never recover enough to train hard. The quality of the training stimulus
is  the  key  that  maximizes  muscle  protein  synthesis.  The  training  program  should  be
designed so the workout regimen leads to more intense workouts.

Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)
Delayed  onset  muscle  soreness  or  DOMS  refers  to  muscle  soreness  one  to  three
days after a workout. In the past, lactic acid build-up or muscle spasms were believed
to produce muscle soreness. Scientists now know that cell damage causes sore muscles.
Heavy workouts can damage fibers and calcium storage depots within the cells. Calcium,
a  chemical  trigger,  causes  muscles  to  contract.  Unfortunately,  high  concentrations  of
calcium break down muscle. Following muscle damage, calcium leaks into the muscle
and causes the muscle proteins to decompose. This causes pain and muscle inflammation.
After  a  few  days,  the  muscles  form  protective  proteins  that  temporarily  protect  the
muscle from further damage and soreness. If you skip too many workouts, you lose these
protective proteins and become susceptible to additional muscle soreness.

MuSCLE AND
ThE NERvOuS SYSTEM
As  discussed  previously,  muscle  fibers  receive  the  signal  to  contract  from  nerves
connected  to  the  spinal  column.  Nerve–muscle  combinations  are  called  motor  units.
Powerful muscles, such as the quadriceps in the legs, have large motor units—each motor
nerve is connected to many muscle fibers. Smaller muscles, such as those around the eye,
have smaller motor units.

The three types of motor units include (1) fast glycolytic (FG), (2) fast oxidative glycolytic
(FOG), and (3) slow oxidative (SO). They are subdivided according to their strength and
speed of contraction, speed of nerve conduction, and resistance to fatigue. The type of
motor unit selected by the body depends on the requirements of the muscle contraction.
The body chooses FG fibers for lifting heavy weights or sprinting because they are fast and
powerful.  FOG  fibers  are  used  mainly  during  mid-length,  higher-intensity  endurance
events  such  as  the  1-mile  run  or  the  400-meter  swim.  The  SO  fibers  are  selected  for
prolonged standing or slow walking because they are more fatigue resistant.

The body exerts force by calling upon one or more motor units to contract. The process
of  activating  motor  units  to  contract  is  called  motor  unit  recruitment.  When  you
want to pick up a small weight, you use few motor units to attempt the task. However,
you use many motor units when you want to lift a heavy weight. When a motor unit calls
upon its fibers to contract, all the fibers contract to their maximum capacity.

Motor units are activated according to their size—smaller motor units engage for light
loads. Large, powerful motor units are only activated when the body must exert maximum
force. The muscles fibers in large, high threshold motor units can increase in size more
than smaller motor units. These fibers are not trained to any extent unless you push them.
It is important to include heavy reps in a resistance training program if you expect to
recruit these hard to train motor units. Failure to do so limits increases in muscle size.

II fibers are stronger but fatigue rapidly.

Increased Strength Through Improved Motor Unit Recruitment
Training  with  weights  improves  the  nervous  system’s
coordination and recruitment of muscle fibers. It is a kind
of  “muscle  learning”  and  an  important  way  to  increase
strength.  As  surprising  as  it  may  seem,  neurological
adaptations (rather than increases in muscle size) account
for most of the increases in muscle strength during the first
three weeks of a resistance training program.

Most  athletes  concentrate  on  muscle  tissue  when  trying
to  increase  strength.  Elaborate  diets,  ergogenic  aids  such
as  anabolic  steroids,  growth  hormone,  and  intense  load
cycles  are  usually  employed  to  help  increase  muscle  bulk.
However, strength depends not only on the size of muscles,
but also on the nervous system to activate them. Strength
training causes the nervous system to more fully “turn-on”

men.  Higher  testosterone  levels  in  men  provide  a  partial
explanation for such findings.

Some motor units are more difficult to recruit (or activate)
than  others.  The  high  threshold  units  are  the  hardest  to
activate, but they are also the strongest and most powerful.
Two  related  neural  adaptations,  enhanced  recruitment
of  high-threshold  motor  units  and  increased  time  high-
threshold  motor  units,  have  important  implications  for
overall  strength  development.  A  motor  unit  is  trained  in
direct  proportion  to  its  recruitment.  Stated  somewhat
differently,  high  threshold  motor  units  (the  muscle  fibers
and their motor nerve) will not be trained unless they are
recruited during training. Neural adaptations that activate
high threshold motor units must occur before these motor
units  can  be  trained.  When  trying  to  develop  explosive
power, for example, you must concentrate on recruiting the
high threshold motor units and turning them on for as long
as possible.

In summary, to achieve maximum strength, you must train
high threshold motor units. These units are only trained if
you  recruit  them.  To  recruit  these  motor  units,  you  must
train intensely and concentrate on accelerating your reps.

to  better  coordinate  their  actions.  These  neural  changes
produce greater muscle force production.

Muscles  increase  force  by  recruiting  more  motor  units.
When  going  for  a  maximum  lift,  the  ideal  situation  is  to
recruit  as  many  motor  units

Increased electrical activity of the muscle occurs relatively
early in the strength training process. The early increases in
strength achieved by the novice during the first few training
weeks are due primarily to improved neural activation rather
than enhanced muscle growth. The early gains in muscular
strength are due to an increased recruitment of motor units.
In  children  and  women,  neural  changes  become  critical
for  maximum  strength  because  muscle  hypertrophy  does
not occur in women and children to the same extent as in

ELASTIC MuSCLE ENERgY
Muscles  have  elastic  properties  that  can  increase  strength
and add to training gains. Most top athletes very effectively
use  elastic  muscle  energy.  It  makes  their  movements  look
smooth  and  explosive.  Elastic  muscle  energy  allows  them
to exert much more force than it is possible to exert during
normal muscle contractions.

Elastic muscle energy is much like a rubber band. When you
stretch the rubber band and let go of the ends, it rebounds
back  to  its  original  shape.  Muscle  works  in  a  similar  way.
If you stretch a muscle suddenly, it tries to rebound to its
resting state. The elastic energy is captured in the muscle as
potential energy. Potential energy in muscle is stored energy
that can be used later to help exert force.

When muscle stretch is immediately followed by a muscle
contraction,  the  rebound  from  the  stored  elastic  energy
greatly  increases  contraction  force.  It  is  much  like  getting
a  push  when  you  start  to  run  or  an  active  assist  during  a
weight  lift.  The  stretched  muscle  rebounds  back  to  its
shorter length. When the muscle contracts at the same time,
the combined forces of muscle contraction and elastic recoil
produce more force than either factor alone.

Stored elastic energy must be used quickly or it is lost as heat.
The secret of using elastic energy effectively is to coordinate
the  nervous  and  muscle  contraction  systems  with  muscle
stretch.  After  the  stretch,  the  muscles  must  be  turned  on
instantly to take advantage of the muscles’ elastic recoil.

Many sports movements provide good examples of elastic
loading. Discus throwers elastically load the arm, chest, and
shoulders by driving with the legs during the initial part of
the throwing motion. The leg drive puts the upper body on

the stretch. The elastic loading of the upper body increases
the total force during the throw. The elastic loading causes a
whip-like motion required for long throws.

is

Stretch  is  no  stranger  during  weight  training.  Even  in
the  controlled  environment  of  a  weight  lifting  contest,
stretch  greatly  affects  how  much  one  can  lift.  Weight  lifts
combine eccentric and concentric muscle actions. Eccentric
contraction
force  development  while  the  muscle
lengthens.  Concentric  contraction  is  force  development
while the muscle shortens. Lifters often make the mistake of
concentrating only on the pushing or active phase of the lift.
Concentric muscle contractions (i.e., the active phase of the
lift)  are  not  isolated  movements.  The  push  always  follows
an eccentric contraction, during which the muscles used in
the lift stretch. Energy is stored in the muscles during the
stretch  phase.  This  stored  energy  can  be  used  during  the
active phase of the lift to produce more force.

Coordination  of  stretch  and  muscle  contraction  is  very
important  during  the  bench  press.  The  pectoralis  major,
triceps,  and  deltoid  muscles  work  eccentrically  to  control
the bar while the weight is lowered to the chest. The muscles
are  elastically  loaded  as  the  bar  reaches  the  chest.  With  a
minimal delay, the stored elastic energy can assist with the
following  pushing  motion.  The  elastic  recoil  in  the  chest,
shoulders, and arms helps one push more weight.

In  an  ideal  lift,  eccentric,  elastic,  and  concentric  phases
of  the  movement  combine.  Coordinating  these  processes
allows  one  to  push  much  more  weight  than  is  possible
during  a  purely  concentric  bench  press  (i.e.,  a  lift  starting
from the chest).

muScle elaSTIcITY
Muscle  contains  elastic  structures  that  can  be  stretched,
absorb  energy,  and  enhance  force  development.  The
elastic  properties  of  muscle  can  be  separated  into  series
elastic and parallel elastic components. These components
work  together  with  the  muscle’s  contractile  component
to  produce  force.  The  contractile  components  include  the
various structures of the sarcomere. The sarcomere is a unit
of muscle that produces contraction. Each muscle fiber has
many linked sarcomeres, and the linked sarcomeres form a
contractile unit that produces force.

The  series  elastic  component  includes  the  tendons  and
cross  bridges  of  the  muscle  fibers.  The  cross  bridges—
small  structures  within  the  muscle  fiber—develop  muscle
force.  The  series  elastic  component  is  the  most  important
component  for  translating  stretch  into  force.  The  parallel

component

The  contractile  and  elastic  components  are  concepts
rather than structures. Both components have elements in
common. For example, the cross-bridges are included in the
contractile and elastic components. They affect contraction
and  give  elasticity  to  the  muscle.  Even  in  a  motion  that
is  not  preceded  by  an  eccentric  muscle  contraction  (i.e.,
lowering the weight in preparation for the lift), such as the
dead lift,  there is  elastic loading of the  muscle. The cross-
bridges are elastically loaded as soon as tension develops. If
the contraction occurs rapidly, the elastic recoil of the cross
bridges assists the force of contraction.

Elastic muscle energy enhances muscle force development
in  a  process  called  the  stretch-shortening  cycle.  Elastic
structures  stretch  during  sudden  jumping  or  throwing
movements.  The  stretch  represents  potential  energy  that
enhances the force produced by the contractile component.
Immediately after the muscle stretches, it actively contracts.
The elastic elements’ recoil assists in force development.

Many types of human motion incorporate stretch-shortening
cycles. When jumping in basketball or high jumping, the leg
muscles  are  stretched  immediately  prior  to  the  jump.  The
elastic  loading  of  the  leg  enhances  the  force  development
during  the  jump.  Hitting  a  baseball  or  golf  ball  includes  a
stretch-shortening  cycle.  Movement  of  the  legs  and  hips
leads movement of the upper body, which creates an elastic
load on the torso and a subsequent whip-like motion of the
upper body. More power is generated under such conditions
than occurs using the upper body muscles alone.

Muscle force increases during lifts by timing the recoil from
muscle  stretch  with  the  activation  of  muscle  contraction.
This advice is contrary to that given by many trainers who
teach  clients  to  perform  exercises  in  a  slow,  controlled
manner.  While  slow,  controlled  training  certainly  has  its
place, some portion of the training program should attempt
to  activate  elastic  muscle  energy  because  of  its  incredible
capacity  to  increase  muscle  force  (and  ultimately  muscle
size). Note that rapid training is appropriate for young power
athletes but not young bodybuilders. Personal trainers must
always consider the needs and physiological demands of the
individuals they supervise and instruct.

Even  in  the  controlled  setting  of  a  weight  lifting  contest
or  when  performing  low-rep,  high  intensity  lifts,  you  can
use elastic energy stored in the muscle. Teach clients to get
into position, stay tight, and “explode” when they lift. This
allows the nervous system to turn on muscles rapidly and
effectively use the elastic recoil of the muscle stretch.

There  are  many  things  sports  scientists  still  need  to  learn
about the role of the stretch-shortening cycle in producing
the best lift. Can the elastic component in muscle be trained?
In other words, can you increase elasticity in muscle? If you
can,  then  you  should  elastically  load  muscles  as  much  as
possible during training. It is probable that muscle elasticity
cannot be trained very much. If that is the case, then working
on timing during lifts is important. Whatever the outcome
of research in this area, it is obvious that the personal trainer
must consider muscle elasticity when designing individual
training and conditioning programs for young athletes.

Strength  training  programs  must  consider  the  contractile,
neural-muscular,  and  elastic  components  of  muscle
contraction and movement. Many athletes and coaches focus
on  contractile  tissue  adaptations  when  designing  training
programs. However, maximum strength, maximum power,
and achieving maximum muscle size requires coordination
of neural activation, storage and release of muscular elastic
energy, and contraction of muscle.

SKIll
Motor skills are highly specific. They involve precise motor
unit  recruitment  patterns  orchestrated  by  the  nervous
system.  Franklin  Henry,  a  research  scientist  from  the
University of California at Berkeley, compared this process
to a computer program stored on a disk. The program, which
is imprinted on the brain, plays back as a motor reflex. Years
of research in motor learning show that skills develop best
when practiced at the same speed and in the same manner
as  in  competition.  Research  on  most  high-power  sports
shows  that  athletes  benefit  more  from  improvements  in

should never be sacrificed for strength and fitness training.

Most skills involve linked motions—activation of body segments in sequence. Effective
movement  requires  activation  of  each  sequence  in  a  precise  order,  while  exerting  the
correct  amount  of  force.  In  addition  to  skill  training,  physical  conditioning  should
prepare each segment for optimal activation. “Linkage versus leakage” is a critical goal
in maximizing the performance of a skill. The personal trainer and coach should strive
to teach children proper technique and movement skills so they can perform smooth,
linked motions as they age.

Neural  changes  occur  early  in  the  strength  training  program.  Cellular  changes  occur

Strength development involves muscle cells, neuromuscular activation, elastic
energy, and skill. Muscle hypertrophy requires tension, anabolic hormones,
nutrients, and rest. Muscles increase in size by adding myofibrils rather than
new muscle cells. Neural activation of motor units plays an important role in
increasing muscular strength. The body increases force output by turning on
more motor units. It regulates force by the number and amount of time it ac-
tivates specific units. Successful athletes, particularly those just beginning their
careers in sports, must learn to use elastic energy. Activating muscle elastic
recoil can greatly increase muscle force output. Improving one’s skill level at
any early age represents the fastest and most efficient way to increase force
output in sports. Never substitute conditioning for skill development. Both are
important and they complement each other.

Personal trainers who work with kids should have a good working knowledge of human
temperature  regulation  during  exercise.  Intense  exercise  increases  heat  production  10
to 20 times above rest. Humans are mammals and must maintain a near constant body
temperature. Death occurs quickly if body temperature increases or decreases too much.

Children have immature temperature regulation systems. They cannot sweat or redirect
blood flow from one part of the body to another the way adults do. Children get cold
more  quickly  than  adults  and  are  prone  to  hypothermia.  Children  are  less  capable  of
high intensity exercise, are metabolically less efficient, have a lower cardiac output at the
same exercise intensity, and have a lower sweat rate compared to adults. They also have
a large body surface area compared to their muscle mass, which can aid in protection
from heat injury.

Animals either have body temperatures that vary with the environment (poikilotherms)
or  that  remain  constant  (homeotherms).  Examples  of  poikilotherms  include  fish,
amphibians, and reptiles. Birds,  humans,  and  other  mammals  are homeotherms. They
can function relatively independent of the environment because they maintain constant
temperatures.  Processes  such  as  oxygen  transport,  cellular  metabolism,  and  muscle
contraction remain unimpaired in hot and cold environments if a homeotherm maintains
an internal temperature compatible with life. The body’s various physiological functions,
such  as  transmission  of  nerve  impulses,  work
well provided the body temperature remains in a
“normal” range. Abnormal increases and decreases
in  body  temperature  are  deadly.  Important  cell
structures  begin  to  deteriorate  at  temperatures
above  41°C.  heat  stroke  and  permanent  brain
damage  can  happen  quickly  if  the  rising  body
temperature is not quickly brought under control.
At  temperatures  below  34°C  (hypothermia),
cellular  metabolism  slows,  greatly  leading  to
unconsciousness and abnormal heart rhythms.

poikilotherm: Cold-blooded

# Principles Of
TEMPERATuRE REguLATION
Normal  resting  body  temperature  ranges  between  36.5  to  37.5°C.  Temperature  varies
throughout  the  body.  The  internal  temperature  of  the  core  (from  the  brain  to  the
rectum) remains relatively constant, whereas skin temperature comes closer to that of
the environment. Core temperature reflects metabolic rate and the balance between heat
production  and  heat  loss,  while  skin  temperature  reflects  environmental  temperature,
metabolic  rate,  clothing,  and  body  water  levels.  Body  temperature  refers  to  the  core
temperature which includes the temperature of key parts of the brain and the temperature
of vital internal organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.

# Hypothalamus

The body regulates its temperature by controlling the rate of
heat production and heat loss. When the rate of heat
production equals the rate of heat loss, the body
achieves heat balance. Without this balance, the
body either gains or loses heat. The hypothalamus
in the brain controls heat balance, with feedback
from heat and cold sensors in the skin. The
hypothalamus works like a thermostat; it
triggers heat production when body temperature
falls and triggers heat loss when it rises.

The  body  regulates  temperature  using  physical
and  chemical  methods.  Physical  temperature
regulation  works  by  changing  the  resistance
to heat flow, while chemical methods increase
metabolic rate.

heaT ProducTIon

Metabolism
Metabolism is the body’s source of internal heat production. Metabolism refers to the sum
total of all the chemical reactions that occur in the body. Most of the energy exchanges
during  metabolism  end  up  as  heat.  The  body  produces  heat  even  during  deep  sleep.
During  exercise,  heat  production  increases  considerably.  The  principle  mechanisms
of  heat  production  include  voluntary  (exercise)  and  involuntary  (shivering)  muscle
contraction  and  biochemical  heat  production  caused  by  the  secretion  of  thyroid
hormone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.

Shivering
Shivering  is  the  primary  mechanism  for  increasing  heat  production  in  response  to
cold.  Maximal  shivering  can  increase  the  body’s  heat  production  by  up  to  five  times.
Compared with muscular exercise, it is an efficient way to increase body temperature
because shivering muscles do not do any work, and most of the expended energy appears
as heat. However, shivering adds to heat loss by increasing the thermal gradient (the
difference in temperature between the person and the environment). In the short run,
shivering keeps you warm. In the long run, shivering speeds heat loss.

hypothalamus: Portion of the
lower brain  which secretes
substances that control
metabolism through
the pituitary gland.
The hypothalamus
helps to regulate body
temperature, appetite,
water balance, blood
sugar, and fat metabolism.
The hypothalamus also regulates
other glands such as the ovaries,
testes, parathyroids, and
thyroid.

shivering: Physiologic method
of heat production in humans
and other mammals that
involves involuntary trembling
or quivering from contraction or
twitching of the muscles.

thyroid hormone: Thyroxine
and triiodothyronine, the
hormones secreted by the
thyroid gland, influence growth,
and metabolism.

Temperature differences in two

the body and the environment.

International Sports Sciences Association64  |  unit 5

Children lose heat more quickly than adults do because they have a high body surface
area compared to their muscle mass. A child could be very cold—dangerously so—and
the adult may not feel anything. Be very careful when working with kids in the cold. They
do not have the cold tolerance that adults do. Shivering is a danger sign in a child.

Heat-generating  hormones  increase  metabolic  rate.  This  can  be  seen  in  increased
thyroxin secretion from the thyroid gland, norepinephrine release from the sympathetic
nervous  system,  and  epinephrine  (adrenaline)  secretion  from  the  adrenal  glands.
Thyroxin  increases  the  metabolic  rate  of  all  the  body’s  cells.  Norepinephrine  triggers
the release of fatty acids, which also increase metabolic heat production because fat use
generates more heat.

Q10 Effect
Increased  temperature  can  be  self-perpetuating  and  dangerous.  This  is  because  the
metabolic  rate  increases  with  rising  temperature  due  to  the  Q10  effect  (i.e.,  the  rate
of  chemical  reactions  doubles  with  each  10°C  increase  in  temperature).  At  high
temperatures, the hypothalamus begins to lose its ability to cool the body.

Unfortunately, the rate of temperature increase occurs faster at these higher temperatures.
At  core  temperatures  above  41.5°C,  the  only  recourse  is  external  cooling  because  the
hypothalamus may no longer be functionally effective.

Radiation, Conduction, and Convection
People  can  gain  heat  passively  in  one  of  three  ways,  through:  (1)  radiation,  (2)
conduction,  or  (3)  convection.  These  processes  will  be  described  in  the  heat  loss
section that follows.

Q10 Effect: Rate of chemical
reactions double with each 10°
C increase in temperature.

radiation: Heat loss or gain in
the form of infrared rays.

conduction: Transfer of heat
between objects.

convection: Gain or loss of
heat to or from air or water.

absolute zero: Lowest possible
temperature (0° Kelvin, -273.15°
Celsius, -459.67° Fahrenheit)
where all molecular motion

# Radiant Heat

# Radiation

heaT loSS
The  body  loses  heat  by  radiation,  conduction,  convection,  and  evaporation.  At  room
temperature, when skin temperature exceeds air temperature, most
heat  is  lost  by  outward  heat  flow  caused  by  the  negative  thermal
gradient. In the heat, or during heavy exercise, evaporation becomes
the dominant mechanism of heat dissipation.

Radiation
Radiation is the gain or loss of heat in the form of infrared rays.
At room temperature and at rest, it accounts for 60 percent of
the total heat loss. Radiant heat loss varies with body position
and  clothing.  Any  substance  not  at  absolute  zero  will
radiate  such  waves.  However,  the  body  is  both  radiating  and
receiving them at the same time. If the body temperature (the
temperature of the nude body) is greater than the surrounding
environment, then more heat radiates from the body than to it.
If  the  temperature  of  the  radiating  bodies  around  it  is  greater,
then the net flow of radiation is inward. The insulation provided
by  clothing  affects  gain  and  loss  of  heat  by  radiation.  Children
gain and lose considerable heat by radiation because of their large
surface area compared to their relatively small muscle mass. People
can gain heat by radiation when they sit in the hot sun.

# Convection

Temperature Regulation  |  65

heat transfer: Movement of
heat from one place to another.

windchill: Effects of air
movement on reducing the
effective temperature.

evaporation: Change from a
liquid to a vapor (gas) form.

insensible water loss: Water
loss from the body that does not
occur through the sweat glands.

Conduction
Conduction transfers heat from the body to an object. About three percent of the total
heat loss at room temperature occurs by this mechanism. A good example of conduction
is the transfer of heat to a chair while a person sits on it. Heat loss in the urine and feces
is another example of conduction. People gain heat from objects such as heating pads
and hot water bottles.

Convection
The conduction of heat to a fluid (air or water) is called convection. This accounts for
about 12 percent of the heat loss at room temperature. In convection, heat conducted to
air or water moves so that other particles also can be heated. As heat is transmitted to the
surrounding air, it rises, allowing additional heat transfer to the surrounding air. Heat
loss by convection occurs much more rapidly in water than in air. People gain heat from
convection when they sit in a hot bath or hot tub.

Heat loss by convection is greater in the wind because warmed air is quickly replaced
by colder air, lowering the effective temperature. For example, the heat loss at 10°C in a
2.2-mph wind is the same as that at 10°C in still air. The effect of wind on temperature is
called windchill and is expressed in kilocalories per hour per square meter (kcal/hr/m2)
of exposed skin surface. Wind speeds above 40 mph have no additional effect on heat loss
because the heat transfer to the skin does not occur rapidly enough.

Evaporation (Sweating)
At  rest  in  a  comfortable  environment,  about  25  percent  of  heat  loss  occurs  due  to
evaporation  of  sweat,  the  watery  substance  secreted  from  the  sweat  glands.  It  is  the
only means of cooling at high environmental temperatures and is critically important
during exercise. When the environmental temperature exceeds that of the skin, the body
gains heat by radiation, conduction, and convection. Body temperature rises if the body
cannot lose heat by evaporation under these circumstances. This occurs in a steam bath,
athletic whirlpool, or hot tub.

The body loses 0.58 kCal of heat for each gram of sweat (water) that evaporates. Sweating
is effective for cooling only if it evaporates. The rate of evaporation is greatly reduced or
totally prevented during high humidity so that the sweat remains in the fluid state. Lack
of  air  movement  hampers  effective  evaporation  because  water  vapor  saturates  the  air
surrounding the body, just as it does inside a sweat suit or football uniform. This explains
why any type of fan helps with cooling on a hot day. Younger children (ages 5 to 10) have
about one-half the sweating capacity of teenagers and adults.

Evaporation occurs because fluid (from sweat or insensible water loss) changes to a
gas as the temperature of the fluid increases. Water evaporates insensibly from the skin
and lungs at a rate of about 600 ml daily. This amounts to a continual heat loss of about
12 to 18 kCal hourly. Insensible water loss cannot be controlled and it occurs regardless
of body temperature. Regulating the rate of sweating controls evaporative sweat loss.

Except for insensible water loss, sweat rates are essentially zero when skin temperature
is low. In hot weather, an unacclimatized individual (person not used to the heat) has a
maximum sweat rate of about 1.5 liters an hour, while an acclimatized person can sweat
up to four liters an hour. During maximum sweating, an adult can lose 3.6 kg body weight
per hour (nearly eight pounds of fluid), while a pre-pubertal child loses about one-half
that. However, the size of sweat droplets is smaller in children, so they tend to evaporate
more sweat, which results in greater cooling per volume of sweat.

The hypothalamus located in the lower brain houses the temperature regulatory center.
Heat-sensitive nerves in the anterior (front) hypothalamus control the responses to heat.
The posterior (rear) hypothalamus controls responses to cold. Some temperature control
is attributed to skin and upper brain receptors, but the hypothalamus is by far the most
important.  Hot  and  cold  skin  temperature  receptors  transmit  nerve  impulses  to  the
spinal cord and then to the hypothalamus, which initiates the appropriate response such
as sweating, shivering, and goose bumps.

Overheating the hypothalamus triggers heat loss mechanisms of sweating and increased
skin  blood  flow,  which  speeds  heat  loss  to  the  outside  air. The  anterior  hypothalamus
stimulates  the  sweat  glands,  resulting  in  evaporative  heat  loss  from  the  body.  The
hypothalamus  also  sends  signals  to  the  cardiovascular  control  center  in  the  brain  to
increase skin blood flow. (Figure 5.1.)

Cold receptors, located primarily in the skin, send signals to the posterior hypothalamus
to  increase  heat  production  and  to  protect  the  brain  and  vital  organs  (the  core).  The
hypothalamus signals high brain centers to restrict (vasoconstrict) blood flow to the skin.
However, the skin blood vessels open up periodically, particularly in the hands and feet,
to maintain the health of the skin. Stimulation of the shivering center triggers shivering.

Cold stimulates the pilomotor center, which causes piloerection (goose bumps), a
reflex from our “hairy evolutionary ancestors” to increase the insulation air space over the
skin. The posterior hypothalamus also causes the release of norepinephrine to mobilize
fatty  acids  and  increase  metabolic  heat  production.  This  section  of  the  hypothalamus
indirectly  increases  thyroid  hormone  production,  which  causes  a  general  increase  in
metabolic rate.

The  hypothalamus
the  body’s  central
functions  as
thermostat  by  keeping  core  temperature  within  a  normal
range. When core temperature rises above or below its “set-
point,”  the  hypothalamus  immediately  initiates  processes
to  increase  heat  production  or  heat  loss.  Under  normal
conditions,  sweating  begins  at  almost  precisely  37°C  and
heat production begins below this point.

Temperature regulation mechanisms during exercise in the
heat  respond  to  relative  exercise  intensity  (i.e.,  percent  of
maximum  effort)  rather  than  absolute  intensity.  Children
do  not  exercise  as  intensely  as  adults  during  sports  and
exercise training. They exercise at lower intensities because
they are smaller and have lower metabolic capacities.

Human behavior is an important component in temperature
regulation; a person who feels too hot or too cold usually
does something about it. When hot, the person may drink
a cold glass of water, remove some clothing, or turn on the
air  conditioning.  When  cold,  he  or  she  may  put  on  some
clothes, turn up the heat, move around, or go inside. Parents,
coaches,  and  trainers  must  remind  children  to  bundle-up
when it’s cold and to drink fluids and stay out of the direct
sun when it’s hot.

The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and
Skin Diseases (NIAMS; www.niams.nih.gov) has presented
the  following  five  sensible  guidelines  for  preventing  heat
injuries in children during exercise and sports:

1.  Schedule regular fluid breaks during practice and
games. Kids need to drink eight ounces of fluid—
preferably water—every 20 minutes, and more
after playing.

2.  Have the child wear light-colored, “breathable”

clothing.

3.  Make player substitutions more frequently in

the heat.

4.  Use misting sprays on the body to keep cool.

5.  Know the signs of heat-related problems, includ-
ing confusion; dilated pupils; dizziness; fainting;
headache; heavy perspiration; nausea; pale and
moist or hot, dry skin; weak pulse; and weakness.
Seek medical attention immediately if the child
experiences any combination of these symptoms
or doesn’t seem quite right.

Humans can tolerate extremely hot and cold climates because of a well-devel-
oped ability to control body temperature within a fairly small range of temepra-
tures. Controlling the rate of heat production and heat loss regulates body tem-
perature. Mechanisms of heat production include basal metabolic rate, shivering,
exercise, hormone-induced thermogenesis, Q10 effect, radiation, conduction, and
convection. The body loses heat by radiation, conduction, convection, evapora-
tion, and excretion. The hypothalamus is the main center for temperature regula-
tion.

Children have immature temperature regulatory systems—they cannot sweat or
shiver as well as adults can. Also, they have a large body surface area compared
to their muscle mass. They are at increased risk for cold injury. In the heat, they
cannot sweat as well as adults but tend to be able to regulate temperature be-
cause they do not exercise as hard and they evaporate more sweat because their
sweat droplets are smaller. In warm (not hot) climates, children lose heat faster
than adults, which compensates for their lower sweat rate. At high temperatures,
they are at increased risk. In the cold, children lose heat faster than adults do—
again, due to their large body surface area. As with adults, increased physical
fitness and making sure the athlete is adequately hydrated are the best protectors
against serious heat injury.

Children have immature temperature regulatory systems. They do not sweat as much as
adults, they have lower cardiac outputs at a given exercise intensity, and their bodies are
less efficient during aerobic exercise. They also have less muscle mass and shorter bones,
so  they  are  less  capable  of  high  intensity  exercise.  For  many  years,  scientists  believed
children had a lower heat tolerance during exercise than adults. However, more recent
studies indicate that heat tolerance during exercise is similar in children and adults.

A nude human lying in still, dry air maintains a constant body temperature when the
outside  temperature  ranges  between  54  and  60°C  (129  to  140°F).  Exercise  in  the  heat
increases the risk of hyperthermia (elevated body temperature). The rate of exercise is
the  most  important  factor  in  this  increased  level  of  risk.  Core  temperature  increases
proportionally  with  increasing  intensities  of  exercise.  Considerable  variability  in  core
temperature at any absolute exercise intensity exists, yet little variation occurs with the
load expressed as a percentage of maximum capacity.

The extent of the effect of environmental temperature on exercise capacity depends on the
body’s ability to dissipate heat and maintain adequate blood flow to the active muscles.
During exercise in the heat, the combined circulatory demands of muscle and skin can
impair  oxygen  transport  capacity.  An  added  problem  is  that  the  general  vasodilation
caused by the inhibition of the vasomotor center increases the amount of blood in the
venous  system  (capacitance  vessels).  Additionally,  plasma  volume  decreases  during
exercise, becoming increasingly acute as the intensity of effort increases. The decrease
in plasma volume can be augmented by the loss of body fluids through sweating. This
can become a potentially acute problem during dehydration. During exercise in the heat,
to  put  it  simply,  there  may  not  be  enough  blood  to  go  around.  Decreases  in  central
blood volume can compromise the return of blood to the heart. This can be a problem
in children because they have relatively lower cardiac outputs than adults at any given
exercise intensity.

unacclimatized humans have several physiological mechanisms for dealing with heat
stress  during  exercise.  Sweating  is  the  primary  means  of  heat  dissipation  under  these
circumstances. First, heart rate increases during submaximal exercise. This mechanism
becomes less effective at higher exercise intensities because the heart rate approaches its
maximum level. When the individual achieves her highest level of physical exertion (i.e.,
maximum),  peripheral  vasoconstriction  overrides  the  vasodilation  originally  elicited
in  response  to  heat  stress.  This  helps  to  maintain  blood  pressure  and  cardiac  output.

Unfortunately, this response negatively effects heat transfer.
In  this  case,  circulatory  regulation  overrides  temperature
regulation. These circumstances explain the danger of heat
injury during exercise in hot climates.

Maximal  oxygen  consumption,  as  measured  during  a
laboratory treadmill test, does not decline in the heat unless
the  person  is  overheated  when  the  test  begins.  Athletes
rarely  have  the  luxury  of  going  from  the  comforts  of  air-
conditioned, normal room temperature into the heat of an
environmental  chamber  for  athletic  contests;  they  usually
have  to  sleep,  eat,  and  train  in  the  adverse  environment
before they perform. Dehydration, lack of sleep, and anxiety
can accelerate the degree of physiological and psychological
stress. Most studies show that maximal oxygen consumption
decreases by six to eight percent in preheated subjects. The
effects of heat exposure during maximal exercise in children
are not well studied.

During  the  first  week  of  heat  exposure,  the  body  makes
several adjustments that lower heart rate, core temperature,
and  skin  temperature  at  rest  and  during  submaximal
exercise.  Additionally,  as  exercise  continues  for  longer
durations,  stability  occurs  in  blood  pressure.  The  primary

physiological  adjustments  of  acclimatization  to  heat
include the following five factors:

1.

Increased peripheral conductance

2.

Increased plasma volume

3.

Increased sweating capacity

4.  Fall in the threshold of skin temperature for the

onset of sweating

5.  Better distribution of sweat over the skin

Acclimatization to heat remains incomplete unless exercise
training accompanies the exposure. Children acclimatize to
heat more slowly than adults.

Blood flow to the skin decreases with acclimatization. This
adjustment  helps  to  restore  central  blood  volume—blood
available to return to the heart—which is vitally important
for maintaining stroke volume and muscle blood flow during
exercise.  The  decrease  in  skin  blood  flow  is  accompanied
by  a  large  increase  in  sweating  and  evaporative  cooling
capacity  that  produces  greater  peripheral  conductance  of
heat. Acclimatized humans have a lower core temperature
during exercise.

aldosterone: Steroid hormone
produced by the adrenal cortex
that controls salt and water
balance in the kidney.

dehydration: Excessive loss of
body water.

heat cramps: Muscle
spasms and pain caused by
intense exercise in the heat;
sometimes related to salt
deficiency, hyperventilation, or
overindulgence in alcohol.

heat exhaustion: Heat
illness related to dehydration.
Common symptoms include
fatigue, lightheadedness,
nausea, vomiting, headache,
rapid heartbeat and low blood

heat stroke: Severe and
often fatal illness produced
by exposure to excessively
high temperatures, especially
when accompanied by intense
exercise. Symptoms may include
increased body temperature,
lack of sweating (50% of victims
continue to sweat), hot dry skin,
and neurological symptoms;
unconsciousness, paralysis,
headache, vertigo, confusion.
In severe cases very high fever,
vascular collapse, and coma
develop.

Acclimatization to heat causes a 12 percent increase in plasma volume, provided exercise
training accompanies the heat exposure. The increase is caused mainly by an increase
in plasma protein. For every 1-gram increase in plasma protein, 15 grams of water are
added  to  the  plasma.  The  increased  plasma  volume  helps  to  maintain  stroke  volume,
central blood volume, and sweating capacity. It also allows the body to hold more heat.

The  increase  in  plasma  volume  is  accompanied  by  an  almost  threefold  increase  in
sweating  capacity  from  about  1.5  liters  an  hour  to  4  liters  an  hour.  Concurrently,  a
more complete and even distribution of sweating across the skin takes place, which is
an  advantage  when  exercising  in  heat  accompanied  by  high  humidity.  Sweat  losses  of
sodium chloride decrease because of increased secretion of aldosterone.

The earlier onset of sweating keeps core temperature under control during the early stages
of exercise. As discussed previously, increased temperature can produce further increases
in temperature from the Q10 effect. The early onset of sweating serves to partially negate
this influence.

Exercise training is essential for heat acclimatization. Training by itself does not provide
a full measure of heat adaptation. Training for endurance in a hot room (i.e., turning up
the heat to “high” in a gym during workouts) can acclimatize a person from a temperate
environment who must compete in the heat.

Genetic studies show individual differences in fluid losses during exercise. Small openings
in the cells call aquaporins are more active in some people than others. Genetic variation
in aquaporin activity can double fluid loss during endurance events such as the marathon
or 10-kilometer run.

Thermal dISTreSS
Thermal distress and heat injury are more common in children than adults. However, the
higher incidence is probably more related to child abuse and dependence issues rather
than an increased risk of heat injury in children. The medical literature has few reports of
heat injuries during sports or exercise in children. In general, heat injuries have become
more common in the general population because of the popularity of competitive and
recreational sports. Children can perform reasonably well and safely in the heat if they
are  physically  fit,  consume  enough  fluid,  and  allow  for  adequate  recovery  between
competitions.

Fortunately,  one  can  prevent  heat  stress  and  injury  by  taking  simple  precautions.
Thermal distress includes dehydration (loss of body fluid), heat cramps (involuntary
cramping  of  skeletal  muscle),  heat  exhaustion  (low  blood  pressure  and  weakness
caused by circulatory inability to compensate for vasodilation of skin blood vessels), and
heat stroke (failure of hypothalamic temperature regulatory function).

Dehydration
Dehydration  is  the  loss  of  fluid  from  the  body.  Dehydration  can  decrease  sweat  rate,
plasma volume, cardiac output, maximal oxygen uptake, work capacity, muscle strength,
and liver glycogen. Dehydration is a common condition during exercise in the heat, yet
it can occur even in thermally neutral environments. Dehydration rates are similar in
children and adults.

Youth FitnessExercise in the heat and Cold  |  73

A water deficit of 700 ml (approximately 1 percent of body weight) will cause thirst. At
a fluid deficit of 5 percent of body weight, the person feels discomfort and alternating
states  of  lethargy  and  nervousness.  Irritability,  fatigue,  and  loss  of  appetite  are  also
characteristic of this level of dehydration. Five percent dehydration is extremely common
in football, tennis, and distance running. Dehydration levels greater than 7 percent are
extremely dangerous. At these levels, salivating and swallowing food become difficult.
At fluid losses above 10 percent, the ability to walk is impaired and discoordination and
spasticity can occur. As 15 percent dehydration approaches, delirium and shriveled skin
are experienced along with decreased urine volume, loss of the ability to swallow food,
and difficulty swallowing water. Above 20 percent weight loss, the skin bleeds and cracks.
This is the upper limit of tolerance of dehydration before death.

Osmoreceptors  in  the  hypothalamus  stimulate  the  drive  to  drink  fluids.  The  US
Department of Agriculture (www.usda.org) recommends that people use thirst to help
them gauge dehydration. It is crucial for athletes who exercise in the heat to take regular
fluid breaks. It also is prudent to weigh athletes before each practice, especially early in
the season and during hot weather.

Certain types of fluid replacement can compound the inadequacy of the thirst mechanism.
Fluids with a high carbohydrate content (glucose or sucrose greater than 9 grams per
100  ml  of  water)  take  longer  to  empty  from  the  stomach.  Numerous  research  studies
reinforce the benefits of modern athletic fluid replacement beverages such as Cytomax.
Cold water also serves as an excellent fluid replacement beverage. Some athletes prefer
the commercial fluids because they are more palatable. Cold milk and chocolate milk
are excellent fluid replacement beverages for children, provided the child is not lactose
intolerant. As long as a suitable fluid is selected, the wishes of the athletes in terms of fluid
preference should be honored. The important point is to get them to drink enough fluid.
Voluntary fluid intake during exercise is similar in children and adults.

Temperature of the rectum.
Often used in exercise studies

Heat Cramps
Involuntary cramping and spasms in muscle groups used during exercise characterize
heat cramps. While depletion of salt and potassium from the muscles is involved with
the problem, the primary cause is muscle fatigue. Often, people who do not experience
heat cramps are fit and heat acclimatized. Children are particularly susceptible to heat
cramps, especially in their legs.

The  classic  treatment  for  heat  cramps  includes  oral  or  intravenous  salt  replacement
and  rehydration.  Because  heat  cramps  reflect  muscle  fatigue,  replacing  fluids  and
electrolytes  will  not  have  any  immediate  benefit.  The  best  treatment  is  gentle  static
stretching, fluid and electrolyte replacement, and rest.

Heat Exhaustion
Heat  exhaustion  and  heat  stroke  are  not  distinct  entities  but  rather  two  degrees  of
thermal  injury.  A  rapid,  weak  pulse,  low  blood  pressure,  faintness,  profuse  sweating,
and  psychological  disorientation  characterize  heat  exhaustion.  It  results  from  not
enough  blood  returning  to  the  heart  because  of  competition  for  blood  between  the
muscles  and  skin.  Although  core  temperature  (which  can  be  estimated  by  measuring
rectal temperature) may be elevated somewhat [usually less than 39.5°C (103.1°F)],
it does not reach the extremely high level associated with heat stroke [greater than 41°C
(105.8°F)]. (Figure 6.1)

sunstroke: Severe and
often fatal illness produced
by exposure to excessively
high temperatures, especially
when accompanied by intense
exercise. Symptoms may include
increased body temperature,
lack of sweating (50% of victims
continue to sweat), hot dry skin,
and neurological symptoms;
unconsciousness, paralysis,
headache, vertigo, confusion.
In severe cases very high fever,
vascular collapse, and coma
develop.

The treatment for heat exhaustion includes supine rest in a cool area and fluid ingestion.
In some cases, intravenous fluid administration may be appropriate. The athlete should
not participate in any further activity for the rest of the day and should be encouraged to
consume fluids hourly if possible for the next 24 hours.

Heat Stroke (Sunstroke)
Heat stroke is the failure of the hypothalamic temperature regulatory center; it represents
a major medical emergency. Heat stroke is principally caused by a failure of the sweating
center,  which  results  in  an  explosive  rise  in  body  temperature  because  the  body  does
not sweat enough. Heat stroke is characterized by a high core temperature (greater than
41°C),  hot,  dry  skin,  and  extreme  confusion  or  unconsciousness.  In  exercise-related
heat  stroke,  the  person  may  still  be  sweating.  The  cardiovascular  effects  are  variable,
with some individuals experiencing low blood pressure and others experiencing a full
bounding pulse and high blood pressure. A heat stroke victim should be packed in ice
and immediately transported to a hospital.

PrevenTIng heaT ProblemS
Children have a higher incidence of heat injury than adults, but most cases occur because
of child abuse and poor supervision rather than an increased susceptibility toward heat
injury in children. The problems associated with exercise in the heat can be minimized
by following 10 simple principles:

1.  Ensure that children are in good physical condition. Heat acclimatization oc-

curs more slowly in children than adults, so there should be a gradual increase
in intensity and duration of training until the athlete is fully acclimatized.
Obese children are more susceptible to heat injury than lean ones. This might
be due to lower fitness levels in kids carrying more body fat.

2.  Schedule practice sessions and games during the cooler times of the day. Allow

adequate rest between competitions when more than one game is played on
the same day.

3.  Modify or cancel exercise sessions when wet bulb globe temperature exceeds

25.5°C. Wet bulb temperature determines humidity, and globe temperature
indicates radiant heat.

4.  Plan for regular water breaks.

5.  Supply a cold drink (8 to 13°C) that is low in sugar (less than 8 grams per 100

ml) and that contains a small amount of electrolytes.

6.  Encourage athletes to “tank up” before practice or games by drinking 400 to

600 ml of water 30 minutes before activity.

7.  Encourage fluid replacement during the early stages of practice and competi-

tion. As exercise progresses, water absorption from the gut decreases.

8.  Weigh athletes every day before practice. Any athlete whose body weight

decreases by 3 percent or more should not be allowed to participate until they
rehydrate. People who tend to lose considerable weight in the heat should be
identified and monitored closely.

9.  Do not use salt pills. Encourage athletes to consume ample amounts of salt at

mealtime by sprinkling a small “pinch” of salt on their food.

10.  Discourage athletes from wearing rubberized “sauna suits” to reduce weight.
Instead, emphasize attaining an optimal body composition for the sport.

hypothermia: Abnormally
low body temperature due to
exposure to the cold. Opposite
of hyperthermia; Abnormally
high body temperature.

ExERCISE IN ThE COLD
Until recently, hypothermia was a factor in sports and exercise only when survival was
at  stake  following  mishaps  in  skiing,  climbing,  or  camping.  People  rarely  experienced
cold stress during exercise because increased metabolism largely prevented negative heat
balance,  and  they  could  put  on  more  clothing  when  they  did  become  cold.  However,
beginning  about  25  years  ago,  large  numbers  of  marginally  fit  people—including
children—began  to  participate  in  endurance  triathlons  (competitions  involving  long
distance  swimming,  bicycling,  and  running)  and  marathons  that  often  exposed  them
to  cold  temperatures  for  many  hours.  People  became  hypothermic  because  the  heat
production of exercise could not keep pace with heat loss, and they had little opportunity
to protect themselves with adequate clothing. Children are susceptible to hypothermia
because they have a large body surface area compared to their muscle mass, which causes
them to lose heat rapidly in the cold. The head has a dense blood supply, so wearing a hat
in the cold is important for children. Be aware that because adults lose heat more slowly
from the head, they may have trouble judging the onset of hypothermia in children.

Cold causes problems for athletes, as you can appreciate when watching football games
played in the snow. The numbing of exposed flesh and the awkwardness and extra weight
of  protective  clothing  handicap  the  players.  Cold  impairs  finger  dexterity  needed  for
catching  and  throwing—cold  effectively  anesthetizes  sensory  receptors  in  the  hands.
Exposed flesh, particularly on the face, is susceptible to frostbite, a potentially serious
medical condition.

Clothing is important during physical activity in the cold. The insulation value of clothing
must be balanced with the increased metabolic heat production of exercise. A person
who wears too much clothing risks becoming a tropical person in a cold environment.
There have been instances of heat stroke in over-clothed people exercising in extremely
cold climates.

Clothes  are  valuable  in  the  cold  because  they  increase  the  body’s  insulation.  Clothing
traps warm air next to the skin and decreases heat loss by conduction. The best clothing
for exercise in the cold allows sweat to evaporate while providing added protection from
the cold. Clothing should be worn in layers so it can easily be removed as metabolic heat
production increases during exercise. Clothing manufacturers have made tremendous
progress developing lightweight clothing that traps water vapor and provides sufficient
insulation and freedom of movement during exercise.

Exercise  can  partially  or  totally  replace  the  heat  production  of  shivering  during  cold
exposure. Skin blood flow increases during physical activity, which decreases the body’s
insulation from the cold. Heat production from exercise and shivering must be adequate
to maintain heat balance, or body temperature drops.

Maximal oxygen uptake and the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise remain unaffected
in  the  cold.  The  metabolic  cost  of  submaximal  exercise  by  people  in  wet  clothing
exercising in the wind is about 15 to 20 percent higher than the same exercise performed
in a comfortable environment. Shivering and increased muscle tone increase the oxygen
cost of exercise.

Swimming  in  cold  water  can  produce  marked  deterioration  in  exercise  capacity  and
maximal oxygen consumption. Heat conductance is about 25 times greater in water than
in air. Body fat percentage is an important factor in determining heat loss in cold water.

Youth FitnessExercise in the heat and Cold  |  77

More body fat increases insulation, which slows the transfer of heat to the water. Long-
distance swimmers usually possess considerable body fat, which slows the rate of heat
loss  during  their  prolonged  swims.  Loss  of  flexibility  contributes  to  the  performance
decrement, probably because the cold water increases the viscosity of muscle (fluids in
muscle cells becomes denser) and connective tissue.

acclImaTIzaTIon and
habITuaTIon To cold
People  exposed  to  environmental  stressors  such  as  heat,  cold,  and  altitude  usually
make  adjustments  to  improve  their  comfort.  Adjustments  to  these  environmental
conditions  include  acclimatization  and  habituation.  Acclimatization  is  physiological
compensation to environmental stress occurring over time. Habituation is the lessening
of the sensation associated with a particular environmental stressor. Simply stated, the
body makes physical changes during acclimatization, while in habituation, the person
learns to live with the stressor.

It is difficult to demonstrate cold acclimatization in people not chronically exposed to
cold. Except for primitive societies, humans do not commonly have the opportunity for
chronic cold exposure. There are three basic tests of acclimatization to cold in humans.

1.  Threshold skin temperature that results in shivering. Shivering occurs later in

people exposed to several weeks of cold temperatures. Cold-acclimatized peo-
ple maintain heat production with less shivering by increasing non-shivering
thermogenesis. They increase the secretion of leptin and norepinephrine,
which causes cellular heat production.

2.  Measuring the temperatures of the hands and feet. In the unacclimatized

person, hand and foot temperatures drop progressively with time during cold
exposure. However, the acclimatized person can almost maintain normal
temperature. Acclimatization improves intermittent peripheral vasodilation—
called the hunting reflex—that makes the hands and feet more comfortable.
Habituation also seems to play a part. Some people seem to lose the pain or
learn to tolerate the pain sensations associated with cold feet and hands, even
though little improvement in circulation or temperature occurs. Children are
more susceptible to chilblains, a cold induced condition involving destruction
of capillary beds in the skin, which results in redness, itching, blisters, and
inflammation.

3.  Ability to sleep in the cold. Unacclimatized people shiver so much they cannot
sleep. Sleeping in a cold environment depends on the extent of non-shiv-
ering thermogenesis. Primitive peoples such as the aborigines of Australia
are exceptions. They can sleep in the cold with little or no clothing without
increases in metabolism.

Physical conditioning is beneficial in acclimatization to the cold just as it is beneficial in
acclimatization to the heat and at high altitude. Physical conditioning produces a higher
body temperature in sleep tests in the cold, and sleep becomes more comfortable.

Little is known about cold acclimatization in children. Young skaters who ice skate in cold
skating rinks show reduced cortisol levels, which is a marker of stress and inflammation.
However, other indications suggest that children might adapt to cold in much the same
way as adults.

habituation: Disappearance of
responsiveness to accustomed
stimulation. Getting used to
the stressor with no apparent
adaptation.

leptin: Hormone produced in
fat cells and circulates in blood
that reduces food uptake and
increases energy expenditure.

non-shivering
thermogenesis: Body heat
production triggered by
uncoupling proteins in the cells
or brown fat.

International Sports Sciences Association78  |  unit 6

frostbite: Cold injury
accompanied by pallor,
numbness, and loss of cold
sensation.

hYPoThermIa
The  hypothalamus  cannot  control  body  temperature  at  low  core  temperatures.
Hypothermia  depresses  central  nervous  system  function,  resulting  in  an  inability  to
shiver,  sleepiness,  and  eventually  coma.  Lower  temperatures  also  result  in  a  lower
cellular metabolic rate, creating a vicious circle: decreases in metabolism lead to less heat
production, which further depresses metabolism. Hypothermia can occur when the rate
of heat production during exercise does not keep pace with the rate of heat loss brought
on by the cold environment.

Hypothermia  is  a  serious  medical  problem  in  endurance  competitions  held  in  cold
climates. Death from hypothermia has been reported in road races held in mountainous
regions. Athletes at risk include those who are not properly conditioned, slow runners
(who  are  exposed  longer  and  cannot  generate  sufficient  heat  through  exercise,
particularly during the later stages of endurance races), those who become wet, and those
who become hypoglycemic (low blood sugar). When a risk of hypothermia exists in an
athletic  competition,  race  personnel  should  make  sure  “space  blankets,”  blankets,  and
warm drinks are readily available as preventive measures.

FroSTbITe
Frostbite, or frozen tissue, typically occurs in exposed areas of the face such as the nose
and earlobes, on the fingers, and on toes. The injury is relatively common in extremely
low air temperatures [-20 to -30°C (-4 to -22°F)] or during periods of high wind chill.
It can cause permanent circulatory damage, and sometimes the frostbitten part must be
amputated because of gangrene. This medical emergency occurs when blood flow to a
body region shuts off, producing infection and tissue death if not treated within hours.

Treat frostbite by placing the frostbitten area in water heated to 37.8 to 42.2°C (100 to
108°F)  until  the  tissue  thaws.  The  water  temperature  should  be  monitored  to  keep  it
from becoming too hot. Tissue damage may occur if the water temperature rises above
42.8°C (109°F). After the body part thaws, it should be kept cool to lessen metabolism
and minimize inflammation. The affected area should not be thawed if there is danger
of refreezing. The affected part should also be covered. The person should be kept warm
with blankets to promote circulation. If left untreated, a gangrenous infection can cause
shock, kidney failure, and delirium.

SuMMARY

The outcome of exercising in high ambient temperatures depends on how well the body dissipates heat and
maintains blood flow to active muscles. Sweating is the primary means of cooling body tissues in the heat. An
increased sweat rate is the most important adaptation that occurs with heat acclimatization. Exercise training is
required to maximize this process.

Thermal injuries can lead to serious medical conditions in both competitive and recreational sports. Thermal in-
juries include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke, injuries typically preceded by dehydration. Children
have a higher incidence of heat injury than adults, but the incidence in sports is relatively rare. Preventive meas-
ures include adequate physical conditioning, exercising during cooler periods of the day, planning regular water
breaks, and limiting workout sessions until adequate acclimatization is achieved.

The type of clothing worn is the most important limiting factor when exercising in the cold. Swimming in the
cold or exercising with wet clothing greatly diminishes performance from accelerated heat loss. Acclimatization
to cold is difficult to demonstrate but does occur. Children have a larger body surface area than adults and tend
to lose heat rapidly from the head on cold days.

Childhood obesity is a health calamity. In the 1960s and 1970s, only about 5 percent of
American children were overweight. Unfortunately over the next 40 years, that percentage
skyrocketed. The most recent study concerning obesity among children and adolescents
reveals shocking results. For youth ages 12 to 19, the prevalence of obesity has climbed
to 18.1 percent. It is even greater among 6- through 11-year-olds (19.6 percent), and is
10.4 percent among 2- through 5-year-olds. Among non-Hispanic black and Mexican-
American  adolescents,  the  prevalence  of  overweight  increased  more  than  100  percent
between 1988–1994, and 2008 obesity rates are 26.8 percent in Mexican American girls
and 29.2 percent in non-Hispanic blacks. (Figures 7.1 and 7.2 on next page)

Obesity  is  “not  cool”  among  kids,  and  this  in  part  has  led  to  a  runaway  epidemic  of
eating disorders. Seventy percent of elementary school aged kids believe they are fat, and
15 percent meet the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders. The personal trainer who
works with kids can help to establish exercise and nutrition habits designed to thwart
the advances in obesity. The trainer and allied health professional also can guide children
toward developing a realistic body image through positive sports and fitness experiences.

Being too fat in childhood creates both immediate and long-term health effects. Many
children develop early symptoms of Type 2 diabetes—particularly insulin resistance—
as well as risk factors for cardiovascular disease that include high blood pressure, high
blood  cholesterol  and  triglycerides,  low  blood  HDL,  and  blood
clotting abnormalities.

Childhood obesity impairs socialization and early learning and can
pyramid into psychological trauma that lasts a lifetime. Childhood
obesity  usually  continues  into  adulthood,  which  creates  life-long
health problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(www.cdc.org)  speculate  that  the  present  generation  may  be  the
first  to  have  more  “diseases  of  civilization”  and  decreased
longevity  than  their  parents.  Figure  7.3  lists  some  of  the  health
problems linked to childhood obesity.

CAuSES OF
ChILDhOOD ObESITY
Most overweight kids become overweight from overeating
(whatever  the  psychological  reasons)  and  not  getting
enough  exercise.  Recent  studies  of  elementary  and  high
school  students  show  that  children  become  progressively
less physically active as they age. Twenty years ago, physical
education was required for four years in most schools. Now,
most  high  schools  only  require  one  or  two  years.  School
districts also have cut back on school sports and supervised
recreational opportunities, so children have fewer choices to
remain physically active throughout the day.

Portion sizes of food are much larger in the United States
than in other countries. It is more profitable for companies
to  compete  by  offering  larger  portions  than  by  offering
smaller portions for less money. Children today eat 200 to
300 more calories daily than just 10 years ago. As a person
trainer,  you  can  help  youngsters  develop  appropriate
exercise and nutritional habits.

WEIghT REguLATION
IN ChILDREN
Children need enough food to grow properly. You can help
to promote growth and development (and hopefully make
a  difference  in  the  obesity  epidemic)  by  teaching  children
to eat more grains, vegetables, and fruits, including low-fat
dairy and other protein-rich foods, and to exercise and play
sports on a daily basis. Encourage them to limit the amount
of  time  they  spend  watching  television  and  playing  video
games, and strongly encourage active participation in sports

and games. Teach parents and guardians not to restrict fat
intake for children younger than age two. You can also help
older children learn about heart healthy diets.

Older  overweight  children  should  curtail  saturated  fat
intake.  Restricting  consumption  of  high-fat  fast  foods
and  switching  to  low-fat  milk  rather  than  whole  milk  are
not  dangerous.  Check  with  your  physician  or  health  care
provider before you change a child’s diet.

MEASuRINg bODY
# Composition
IN YOuNg PEOPLE
The  personal  trainer  should  have  a  good  idea  of  a  young
person’s  starting  point  before  suggesting  nutrition  and
exercise programs. Scientists measure body composition by
dividing the body into three compartments–muscle, bone,
and fat. This is oversimplifying body composition, but it is
useful for measuring progress and assessing the effectiveness
of  the  exercise  and  wellness  program.  Measuring  body
composition should be a key procedure for personal trainers
and coaches who work with children:

1.  Body composition assessment provides a starting
point upon which to base current and future deci-
sions about weight loss and weight gain.

2.  Body composition assessment helps set realistic
goals about changing fat and non-fat compart-
ments.

3.  Body composition assessment helps to establish

general health status and can play a crucial role in
the health and fitness goals of everyone.

body mass index (bMI):
An index of the proportion of
weight to height. BMI= weight
(kg)/(height (m)2; BMI= [weight
(lb)/height (in)/height (in)] x
703.

It  is  a  good  idea  to  measure  changes  in  the  body  fat  and  lean  components,  including
individual  girths  and  the  sum  of  trunk  and  extremity  skinfolds,  over  the  course  of  an
exercise  program  because  this  helps  to  gauge  the  effectiveness  of  the  program.  It  also
provides  realistic  feedback  to  the  participants,  coaches  and  trainers,  and  parents  and
guardians. Results can also act as motivators for the participant.

heIghT and weIghT normS
For u.S. chIldren
Occasionally,  a  child  will  be  unusually  muscular  and  will  fall  outside  of  the  norms
for  height  and  weight.  In  general,  body  weight  should  be  proportional  to  height.  The
following figures from the Centers for Disease Control present norms for weight, height,
and weight for height. The norms provide guidelines only. Look for the obvious when
evaluating  body  composition—excess  body  fat  and  large  skinfolds  when  making  field
measurements. A high body mass index (weight, kg/height2, m)—while of limited use
in athletic populations—often serves as an indicator of obesity. (Figures 7.4 to 7.11)

heIghT-For-weIghT TableS
The earliest attempts in the early 1900s to predict life expectancy relied on height-for-
weight  tables.  Insurance  companies  developed  statistics  to  determine  insurance  rates.
Later, they expanded their model to include the effects of age and frame size. Unfortunately,
the tables did not provide valid information about the relationship between body weight,
disease,  and  premature  death.  An  athletic  person  could  weigh  more  than  the  average
weight-for-height ideal yet still be “under fat” in total body fat content. The “extra” weight
could simply be additional muscle mass.

Table  7.1  on  page  90  presents  the  still  popular  height-for-weight  tables  for  adult  men
and  women  published  in  1983  by  the  Metropolitan  Life  Insurance  Company  (www.
metlife.com)  based  on  selected  individuals  whom that  company  decided  to  insure for
life insurance.

Frame Size
Note that the tables have columns for small, medium, and large frame size. Unfortunately,
an acceptable definition for small, medium, and large frame has not been established.
Rough guidelines exist, however, to make the distinction (www.halls.md/ideal-weight/
met.htm),  but  the  method  varies  considerably  and  is  often  confusing  to  compute.
Researchers  are  hard  pressed  to  come  up  with  an  acceptable  definition  of  frame  size.
Even at the extremes of the body weight range, whether a 230-pound person or someone
of slight build (short in stature and low body weight), there is no hard and fast rule for
what  should  constitute  a  large,  medium,  or  small  frame  size.  This  dilemma  offers  an
additional reason why height-for-weight tables that include frame size should not serve
as decision makers about weight loss or weight gain, especially for many athletic groups.

As discussed previously, using arbitrary standards for children is difficult and can even
be  unhealthy.  Growth  requires  adequate  calories  and  a  variety  of  nutrients.  Overly
restrictive  dietary  plans  can  compromise  growth  and  development.  A  good  course  of
action  is  to  increase  physical  activity  and  simultaneously  encourage  the  child  to  eat
healthier meals.

bodY maSS Index (bmI)
BMI is another popular index that incorporates height and weight to assess overweight and obesity. BMI—although badly
flawed—serves as the principle measure of obesity used in epidemiological studies. BMI was first described by 19th century
Belgian social statistician Adolphe Quetelet (1796 to 1874) and originally known as the Quetelet index. The BMI relates body
mass to height squared (BMI = weight÷height2). For purposes of BMI calculation, (www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/
bmi_tools.htm), body weight is expressed in kilograms (kg) and height in meters (m). Clinicians and researchers use the BMI
as a screening tool to evaluate the “normalcy” of an individual’s body weight by following this four-step procedure:

measuring bmI using metric measurements: bmI = weight (kg)/height (m)/height2

Step 1. Multiply body weight (pounds) by 0.45 to convert weight to kg
Step 2. Multiply height (inches) by 0.0254 to convert height to meters (m)
Step 3. Multiply Step 2 answer by itself to obtain square meters (m2)
Step 4. Divide Step 1 (mass) by Step 3 (height2)

measuring bmI using english measurements: bmI = [weight (lb)/height (in)/height (in)] x 703

Step 1:  Measure height in inches (convert fraction to decimal value; e.g., 50 1/2 inches is expressed as

50.5 inches)

Step 2: Divide weight by height and divide the answer by height. Multiply by 703.

What Does BMI Reveal?
At BMI’s between 20 and 25, the disease risk is rated very low. For each 5-unit increase
in BMI, disease risk increases curvilinearly from very low at BMI 20 to 25, to very high
risk at BMI 40 to 45. While BMI serves as a useful screening tool, it should not be used
as a diagnostic tool. Do not use BMI as the sole basis for designing an exercise, diet, or
weight loss program.

# Bmi-For-Age
Children, even those prone to obesity or overweight, have lower BMI’s than adults. The
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)  recommends  bMI-for-age  as  an
appropriate screening tool for identifying overweight children and their future risk of
obesity or overweight. The CDC noted that a high BMI-for-age relates to risk factors for
cardiovascular disease including abnormal blood fats, poor blood sugar regulation, and
high  blood  pressure.  A  high  BMI-for-age  during  puberty  links  to  abnormal  blood  fat
levels and high blood pressure in middle age.

Figures 7.10 and 7.11 on the following pages show the BMI percentiles for children ages
2 to 20 years.

Children at or above the 95th percentile for their age are considered obese, while children
at or above the 85th percentile are overweight. Those at or below the 5th percentile are
underweight. The  percentile  rank  of  a  BMI  score  is  the  percentage  of  BMI’s  the  same
or  lower.  For  example,  a  BMI-for-age  at  the  85th  percentile  means  that  85  percent  of
children for that age have lower BMI’s. The CDC has a BMI-for-age calculator that makes
it easy to perform these calculations (apps.nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx). As
discussed, BMI or BMI-for-age is only a screening tool; it should not be used as the sole
criteria for designing diet and exercise programs or determining ideal weight.

bMI-for-age: Used to measure
obesity risk in children. A child
is considered overweight if the
BMI-for-age is greater than the
85th percentile.

COMPOSITION OF ThE huMAN bODY
The  body’s  three  major  structural  components  include
muscle,  fat,  and  bone.  Dr.  Albert  Behnke,  a  pioneer
body  composition  researcher,  developed  the  concept  of  a
reference man and a reference women to serve as a frame
of comparison among people, much like gold serves as the
standard or “worth” of modern United States currency.

The measurement values for the reference man and woman
are based on the average physical dimensions obtained by
Behnke and other researchers from detailed measurements
of  thousands  of  participants  in  large-scale  military  and
national studies representing many countries.

The reference man is taller than the reference female by four
inches,  is  heavier  by  29  pounds,  has  a  skeleton  weighing
more (23 vs. 15 pounds), and has a larger muscle mass (69
vs.  45  pounds)  and  lower  total  fat  content  (23.1  vs.  33.8
pounds) than the reference female. There are no reference
children. The CDC norms show large differences at any age
in children in height and weight.

People—particularly children—should not strive to achieve

the  same  body  composition  as  the  reference  models. This
goal would  not only  be  unrealistic but difficult to achieve
because  few  men  or  women  in  the  population  have  the
identical  height  and  weight  as  the  standards.  Instead,
the  reference  models  should  serve  as  a  useful  frame  of
comparison  for  the  fat  and  non-fat  compartments  among
males and females and among individuals within the same
gender and age.

The  personal  trainer  should  apply  the  reference  male  and
female  data  to  identify  an  individual’s  body  composition
relative  to  the  established  standard  compositional  values.
Using  this  approach,  individuals  will  know  how  they
compare to the standards. They accomplish this with the idea
that if they wish to initiate change in their body composition
(for example, improve their lean to fat ratio), they can do
so in a realistic yet prudent manner, under the supervision
of  their  health-care  professional.  This  principle—while
important in adults—is critical in children. Trying to affect
large changes in body composition in children is unhealthy
and can interfere with growth.

eSSenTIal and STorage FaT
The body’s total fat content exists in two depots or storage sites. The first depot, termed
essential fat, refers to fat stored in the marrow of bones and in the heart, lungs, liver,
spleen, kidneys, intestines, muscles, and fat-rich tissues throughout the central nervous
system. The brain tissue consists mainly of fat, which emphasizes the role that essential
fat plays in normal physiologic functioning—particularly in children. The second depot
is called non-essential fat, or storage fat, and serves as an energy reserve.

essential fat: Fat stored in
the marrow of bones and in
the heart, lungs, liver, spleen,
kidneys, intestines, muscles, and
fat-rich tissues throughout the
central nervous system.

non-essential fat: Storage fat
found in adipose tissue.

adIPoSe TISSue
Adipose  tissue—or  fat  cells—store  energy  as  triglycerides  which  is  a  simple  molecule
consisting  of  three  fatty  acid  molecules  joined  to  glycerol.  Triglyceride  molecules
cumulate  in  specialized  cells  within  the  adipose  tissue  mass.  There  are  two  forms  of
adipose tissue in mammals; white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue. In humans,
most fat is stored in white adipose tissue. Brown adipose tissue is a special tissue that can
increase its own metabolism and may play an important role in body weight regulation.

Functions of Adipose Tissue
White  adipose  tissue  serves  three  important  functions:  (1)  insulation,  (2)  mechanical
cushioning of internal organs, and (3) energy supply. Consider the subcutaneous adipose
tissue mass found directly below the skin surface. This layer of insulation, which varies
in thickness on the trunk and extremities, conducts heat more poorly than other tissues.

Fat’s major function is energy storage; it provides a ready fuel source during an energy
imbalance—less food consumed than energy expended. The person’s energy imbalance
creates an energy deficit. The energy required to keep the body functioning must come
from sources other than food. Indeed it does; the body utilizes its own tissues to provide
the required energy. When one consumes fat in excess of the body’s requirements, the
excess accumulates in the fat depots and the person literally becomes “fatter” from the
stored excess.

Fat  provides  an  efficient  way  to  store  excess  energy  because  of  its  relative  absence  of
water. This means that more energy “stores” within one  gram  of fat (9 kcal) than one
gram of either carbohydrate (4 kcal) or protein (4 kcal). If animals stored their excess
energy as protein or carbohydrate, the animals’ increased mass would certainly interfere
with  activities  of  daily  living  because  the  animal  would  simply  increase  its  mass  and
hence its volume is out of proportion to its physiologic capacity.

STorage FaT
Fat  is  a  nutritional  reserve.  Though  most  noticeable  as  subcutaneous  fat  found  below
the  skin’s  surface,  fat  also  can  be  found  surrounding  various  internal  organs,  serving
to protect those organs from trauma. Although the proportional distribution of storage
fat  in  males  and  females  is  similar  (12  percent  in  males,  15  percent  in  females),  the
total  quantity  of  essential  fat  in  females—which  includes  the  sex-specific  fat—is  four
times higher than in males. More than likely, the additional essential fat is biologically
important for child bearing and other hormone-related functions.

Two  general  categories  of  procedures  assess  body  composition:
(1) direct methods, which involve chemical analysis of the animal
carcass or human cadaver, and (2) indirect methods, which include
hydrostatic  weighing (densitometry, more commonly called
underwater  weighing),  air  displacement  plethysmography
(BodPod; also measures body density), and surface anthropometry
(skinfolds and girths). Other popular indirect techniques include
bioimpedence,  near-infrared  interactance  (NIR),  computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual-
photon  absorptiometry  (DEXA).  The  indirect  methods  predict
the results of the direct methods, which cannot be used on living
human beings.

How to Measure
Subcutaneous Skinfold Fat
The rationale for taking skinfolds relies on the fact that about one-half to one-third of
the body’s total fat stores lie directly beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat), and this fat
volume relates closely to the body’s total fat content.

To  measure  skinfold  thickness,  the  thumb  and  forefinger  grasp  a  fold  of  skin  and
subcutaneous fat, pulling it away from the natural contour of the skinfold. The caliper’s
pincer arms at their point of skin contact exert constant tension. The thickness of the
skin’s  double  layer  and  subcutaneous  tissues  is  read  directly  from  the  caliper  dial  and
recorded in millimeters.

triceps,  chest,  mid-axillary,  subscapula,  and  suprailiac,
abdominal,  and  upper  thigh  sites.  Take  skinfolds  on  the
right side of the body with the subject standing. Two or three
measurements should be made at each site and their average
used as the skinfold score. In the hands of an experienced

tester (hundreds of subjects measured over several weeks at
all of the anatomic sites), reliability of measurement is high.
This  means  the  resulting  skinfold  score  represents  a  good
estimate of a “true” score and the person can feel confident
the score represents the thickness of fat at that anatomic site.

Anatomical Location of Eight Frequently Measured Skinfold Sites

Triceps – vertical fold measured at
the midline of the upper arm halfway
between the tip of the shoulder and
the tip of the elbow.

Suprailiac – slightly oblique fold
measured just above the hipbone.
The fold is lifted to follow the natural
diagonal line at this point.

Thigh – vertical fold measured at the
midline of the thigh, two-thirds if the
distance from the knee cap to the
hip on the anterior surface.

Chest – diagonal fold between the
anterior axillary fold and the nipple,
taken one inch from the anterior
axillary fold.

Subscapula – measure the fold
located along an oblique line just
below the bottom tip of
the scapula

Abdomen – measure the fold verti-
cally so that the caliper tips fall one
inch the right of the umbilicus.

Mid-axillary – measure the fold in
a horizontal line at the midaxillary
line level with the bottom of the
sternum.

Mid-calf – vertical fold measured at
medial aspect of the maximal girth
with the knee and hip flexed to 90˚
(foot on low stool).

Usefulness of
Skinfold Measurements
The  best  way  to  use  skinfolds  is  to  sum  the  trunk  and
extremity  scores  to  indicate  the  relative  degree  of  fatness
among  individuals.  The  sum  of  skinfolds  also  can  reflect
changes  in  fatness,  as  for  example,  “before”  and  “after”
a  physical  training  regimen  with  or  without  dietary
intervention.  Changes  in  individual  skinfolds  including
the  total  score  can  than  be  evaluated  on  an  absolute  or
percentage basis.

Many  researchers  and  personal  trainers  use  skinfolds  to
predict percent fat and fat-free weight from more than one
hundred  equations  published  in  the  literature.  While  this
sometimes  works  well  with  specific  discrete  populations,
it  is  inappropriate  in  children.  It  is  almost  impossible  to
find  a  valid  body  composition  equation  that  takes  into
consideration age, gender, maturational status, and sport.

Practical Approach to
Skinfold Measurement
ISSA recommends that health-care professionals NOT use
skinfolds to predict body fat, but instead, do the following.
First,  take  skinfolds  at  eight  anatomic  sites—triceps,
subscapula,  chest,  mid-axillary, suprailiac, abdomen, mid-
calf,  and  thigh.  Note  that  the  triceps,  mid-calf,  and  thigh
sites represent the extremities, with the remainder being the
trunk region.

Sum  the  skinfolds  at  each  region  to  determine  total  fat
thickness. As young athletes implement changes with either
training or dietary regimens, or both, you will have a nice
comparison for the “before” and “after” conditions. Tracking
body composition changes gives the client “real-world” data
to  chart  their  progress.  Providing  objective  feedback  on
body  composition  changes  is  a  sure-fire  way  to  improve
client compliance with training programs.

SuMMARY

Widespread obesity in children is a recent health calamity—more than 18 percent
of our children are now overweight, and the trend is accelerating at an alarming
rate, particularly among Mexican-American boys and non-Hispanic black girls.
Being too fat in childhood has immediate and long-term health effects. Many
develop symptoms of Type 2 diabetes—particularly insulin resistance—and risk
factors for cardiovascular disease. These include high blood pressure, high blood
cholesterol and triglycerides, low blood HDL, and blood clotting abnormalities.

The majority of overweight kids become overweight from overeating and not
getting enough exercise. Recent studies of elementary and high school students
show that children become progressively less active as they age, due in part to
increased time devoted to television and video games.

Children need enough food to grow properly. Promote growth and development
and prevent obesity by teaching children to eat grains, vegetables, and fruits, as
well as low-fat dairy and other protein-rich foods, and to exercise and play sports.
Advise parents to limit the time kids spend watching television and playing video
games, and encourage participation in sports and games. Parents must NOT
restrict fat intake for children younger than age two. Older children should learn
about heart healthy diets.

Use the sum of skinfolds at the extremity and trunk regions—triceps, subscapula,
chest, mid-axillary, iliac, abdomen, mid-calf, and thigh—to assess total fat thick-
ness in those regions. As young athletes alter their body composition with either
training or diet, or both, you will have a nice comparison among the skinfold sites
in the “before” and “after” conditions.

Body mass index (BMI = weight÷ height2) is a screening tool to evaluate the
“normalcy” of an individual’s body weight. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) recommends BMI-for-age as an appropriate screening tool for
identifying overweight children and their future risk of obesity or overweight.

Designing  an  exercise  program  for  anyone—particularly  children—requires  a  basic
knowledge of how exercise affects the body. As discussed previously, children and adults
respond similarly to training with a few exceptions that will be covered in Section 2 of
this training manual.

The basic principles of training are similar for beginning exercisers and more experienced
people.  Both  subject  themselves  to  an  exercise  stress,  and  their  bodies  respond  by
increasing physical fitness. For example, the beginner’s program might include a brisk
walk or bike ride, while a serious athlete might bench press 300 lbs or run 60 seconds
for 400 meters. Stress and adaptation are the same in anyone who exercises, whether the
individual is a world-class athlete or a junior high school student trying to improve overall
fitness.  Fitness  increases  by  giving  the  body  an  unaccustomed  exercise  stress,  such  as
walking instead of sitting, lifting a heavier weight, running faster or farther, or stretching
a muscle more than usual. The body adapts to the stress by improving its function.

In the late 1940s, Dr. Hans Selye (1907 to 1982), Austrian physician and endocrinologist
and professor and director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the
University of Montreal for 50 years, formulated the theory of stress adaptation, a theory
that  has  had  a  profound  effect  on  medicine.  His  theory  has  tremendous  implications
for  how  individuals  condition  themselves  for  physical  activity  and  sports.  He  called
the process of stress adaptation the “general adaptation syndrome” or GAS. Selye
studied the causes and consequences of stress and described three processes involved in
response to a stressor (a stressor can be exercise, cold, bacteria, or anything that upsets
the body’s internal balance mechanisms):

1.  alarm reaction

2.

resistance development

3.  exhaustion

The  Alarm  Reaction  refers  to  the  initial  response  to  the  stressor.  It  is  a  process  of
mobilization  for  the  organism.  During  exercise,  for  example,  reaction  to  the  stress  is
manifested  in  harder  breathing,  sweating,  and  an  increasing  heart  rate.  The  alarm
reaction disturbs the body’s physiologic balance.

During the Resistance Development Stage, the body attempts to adjust to the effects
of the stressor. As the body improves its function, the stressor becomes less disruptive

general adaptation syn-
drome (gAS): Theory de-
veloped by Dr. Hans Selye to
describe the way the body reacts
and adapts (or fails to adapt) to
physical and emotional stresses.

alarm reaction: First stage of
the general adaptation syn-
drome (GAS) involving the initial
response to a stressor; responsi-
ble for mobilizing an organism.

resistance development
stage: Second stage of GAS,
during which the body actively
attempts to adjust to the effects
of a stressor.

Youth FitnessThe Training Response: Principles of Training & Adaptation  |  103

stage of exhaustion: Third
stage of GAS, during which the
organism can no longer resist
stress.

specificity of training: The
body’s unique reaction to a
stressor.

individual differences:
People respond differently to
the same stressor largely due to
genetic factors.

progression: People adapt
best to training when there are
increasing levels of difficulty in a
training program.

reversibility: Loss of fitness
gains with removal of the stress
of exercise.

load: Resistance or weight used
during the exercise.

repetition: Number of times
the athlete repeats the exercise.

rest: Amount of time spent not
exercising between sets or work-
outs. Rest is essential for adapta-
tion and should be incorporated
into every training program.

frequency: Number of training
sessions in a given period.

to  overall  physiology.  For  example,  when  lifting  weights,  muscles  increase  in  size
(hypertrophy)  and  strength,  making  the  load  less  stressful.  Resistance  development  is
the goal of physical conditioning. You only adapt if the stress load disrupts the body’s
physiologic  balance.  During  exercise,  if  the  stress  falls  below  a  critical  intensity,  then
fitness  cannot  improve.  In  contrast,  injury  is  likely  if  your  body  cannot  tolerate  the
training load.

The  amount  and  intensity  of  exercise  necessary  to  improve  fitness  depend  on  the
current level of fitness, age, health, mental outlook, and a number of unknown factors.
For example, running a ten-minute mile may be exhausting to a sedentary, overweight
13-year-old but would cause essentially no adaptive response in a world-class distance
runner. Likewise, a training run tolerated easily one day may be completely inappropriate
on  a  day  following  a  prolonged  illness.  Environment  can  also  disturb  performance.
Extreme heat or cold, high altitude, or polluted air can decrease fitness.

If the stress is too great, then the third stage of GAS, known as the stage of exhaustion,
prevails. This stage is characterized by excessive stress that causes injury. The stress can
be acute (applied all at once) or chronic (occurring over a longer time period). Results
of acute exhaustion include fractures, sprains, and strains. Chronic exhaustion is subtler
and manifests itself in overtraining, stress fractures, and emotional stress.

PRINCIPLES OF TRAININg
A number of factors influence how the body adapts to the stress of exercise. These include
the degree of overload (how hard you push yourself), specificity of training (training
the way you want your body to adapt), individual differences (genetics), progression
(taking it one step at a time), and reversibility (the “use it or lose it” idea).

The overload PrIncIPle

The basis of the General Adaptation Syndrome is that stressing the body to a tolerable
limit  causes  adaptation  and  improved  function.  This  positive  stressor  is  an  overload,
quantified according to load, repetition, rest, and frequency. Load refers to exercise
intensity. Repetition refers to the number of times a load is administered. Rest refers to
the time interval between repetitions. And frequency is the number of training sessions
per week. For example, in weight training,
young  athletes  might  do  three  sets  of
eight  different  exercises  with  a  weight
they can barely lift for 10 repetitions (load
and  repetition),  with  a  1-minute  pause
between each set (rest). They might repeat
this workout at a frequency of three times
a  week.  The  application  of  the  principle
of overload in an exercise program is not
an  exact  science.  The  child  should  start
conservatively and build up. The overload
is excessive if the athlete becomes injured,
has  trouble  recovering,  or  is  exceedingly
sore. The personal trainer or coach must
be  part  scientist  and  part  artist  when
designing a program that promotes fitness
yet prevents injury and soreness.

International Sports Sciences Association104  |  unit 8

SPecIFIcITY oF TraInIng
The  body  adapts  specifically  to  the  stress  of  exercise.  For
example,  the  adaptation  to  endurance  distance  running
or  swimming  differs  from  the  adaptation  to  strength
exercises—such as weight lifting—and power exercises, such
as sprinting. Any training program should reflect the desired
adaptation. Train the way you want the body to change.

Doing the wrong type of training can impair certain fitness
gains. For example, training for strength and endurance at
the  same  time  interferes  with  strength  development.  This
is not a problem for a person who exercises for improved
health and appearance. However, it becomes an important
consideration  for  a  person  trying  to  develop  maximum
strength and power.

Sports skills are extremely specific. Scientists have discovered
that  movement  skills  become  ingrained  in  the  nervous
system and are “played back” by reflex. The aim of practice
and  coaching  is  to  ingrain  the  correct  motion;  practicing
incorrect  motions  develops  the  wrong  patterns  in  the
nervous system and produces incorrect movement patterns.
The more a person practices a movement (up to a certain
point on a learning curve), the more it reinforces the skill in
the nervous system. Therefore, it is imperative that athletes
practice  only  correct  movements  (i.e.,  good  technique).  A
wise  coach  once  stated,  “Perfect  practice  makes  perfect.”
Spending hours practicing incorrectly improves the skill but
in the incorrect way. For example, it is far better to practice
a few golf swings with perfect form and concentration than
to  take  50  swings  in  rapid  succession  when  each  swing  is
done with less than perfect attention to detail. The same can

be said for executing a particular lift such as the bench press
or squat. It is far better to do fewer reps with “perfect” form
than to do 10 reps one after the other without attention to
correct form and with poor concentration.

IndIvIdual dIFFerenceS
Anyone  watching  the  Olympics,  a  professional  football  or
basketball  game,  a  golf  tournament,  or  a  tennis  match  on
TV  can  readily  see  that,  from  a  physical  standpoint,  not
all  athletes  are  created  equal.  There  are  large  individual
differences in the ability to perform, learn sports skills, and
adapt to training. Genetics limits your capacity to develop
fitness  and  skill.  We  can  all  aspire  to  play  basketball  like
LeBron James, hit home runs like Albert Pujols, or swing a
golf club like Tiger Woods. But few of us will ever achieve
that  level  of  performance,  no  matter  how  much  time  we
devote to mastering the skills involved. Even though most
people may not rise to the level of the genetically gifted few,
improvement  is  possible  for  anyone  who  remains  focused
on a systematic program.

Genetics  also  plays  a  part  in  general  health  and  wellness.
Some  people  are  genetically  healthier  than  others.  Their
immune  systems  naturally  fight  disease  better  than  those
of other people, making them less susceptible to coronary
heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Science tells us though,
that  while  some  individuals  may  be  fortunate  enough  to
have a family history of longevity and freedom from many
diseases,  lifestyle  is  far  more  important  than  genetics  in
determining optimal health and well being.

Discovering  athletic  talent  in  children  is  difficult  but  not
impossible. Research studies show that the very best athletes,
those  who  rank  in  the  top  1  percent  during  their  school
years, are also the top athletes in college and beyond. Tiger
Woods, for example, was an exceptional golfer throughout
childhood,  high  school,  and  college,  and  has  continued
to  perform  with  great  skill  during  his  professional  career.
However,  in  the  majority  of  cases,  it  is  difficult  to  predict
which  athletes  will  excel  in  college  or  professional  sports
based  on  their  performance  during  childhood.  Superstar
athletes  such  as  Michael  Jordan  and  Babe  Ruth  were  not
standouts as young children. Jordon was actually cut from
the sophomore basketball team.

While good genes are important for elite level performance,
hard work and concentrated effort are even more important
for  success.  Malcolm  Gladwell,  in  his  book  Outliers:
The  Story  of  Success  (Little,  Brown,  and  Company,  2008)
presents the idea that success in almost anything requires at
least 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. Great athletes don’t
require  exceptional  genetics—only  better-than-normal
natural  talent.  Beyond  that,  consistent  practice  and  good
coaching are most important.

ProgreSSIon
Adaptation  to  the  stress  of  training  occurs  most  readily
when one gradually applies the exercise stress. High levels
of  fitness  require  many  years  of  training  and  involve
progression  in  small  stages.  Superior  fitness  and  optimal
physical  performance  represent  a  combination  of  many
small  gains.  One  cannot  become  fit  overnight—only
gradually, one step at a time.

reverSIbIlITY
This principle basically means, “Use it, or lose it.” It is the
reverse  of  the  overload  principle.  The  body  adapts  to  the
stresses  placed  upon  it.  Exercising  more  intensely  than
usual improves fitness; doing less reduces fitness. A graphic
example of reversibility occurs when you wear a cast for a
broken bone. When the doctor removes the cast, your arm
or leg is smaller than before. This occurs because the muscles
atrophy or become smaller from disuse or inactivity.

DEvELOP ThE bODY
TO SuIT ThE LIFESTYLE
The  human  body  is  extremely  adaptable.  Coaches  and
trainers  must  determine  what  the  child  wants  from  an
exercise  program  and  then  mold  his  or  her  body  in  that
direction. If the goal is health promotion and the child does
not want to begin a formal exercise program, structure the
child’s life so that he or she becomes more physically active
during the day. For more lofty fitness goals, determine the
elements necessary to achieve those goals and find a way to
incorporate them into the child’s routine.

Many  young  people  want  to  improve  performance  in
recreational sports. If the chosen sports require exceptional
endurance,  concentrate  on  the  oxidative  energy  system
and endurance exercise. If the goal is to excel in tennis or
volleyball, training must focus not only on developing skill
but  on  increasing  muscle  power  and  general  endurance,
as  well.  If  the  desired  outcome  is  improved  appearance,  it
is  crucial  to  develop  a  healthy  nutrition  plan  and  exercise

strategy  to  foster  fat  loss  and  allow  for  the  maintenance  or  gain  of  lean  body  mass.
Exercise will be fun and rewarding if it tracks with the individual’s goals.

Skeletal muscle is highly adaptable. If it is overloaded—i.e., loaded more than usual—it
becomes stronger. Likewise, if deconditioning occurs because the muscle is habitually
contracted less forcefully than normal, the muscle becomes weaker. You build strength
by increasing muscle size, improving the way the nervous system transmits information
to the muscles, and coordinating muscle elasticity with muscle contraction.

Athletes  benefit  the  most  from  their  program  if  they  follow  the  Seventeen  Principles
of  Training.  These  principles  are  a  guide  to  gradual,  long-lasting,  injury-free  fitness
development that leads to improved performance with the smallest risk of injury. They
also serve as a guide to gradual and long-lasting fitness development. (Table 8.1)

1. Train the Way You Want
the Body to Change
This  means  stress  the  body  so  that  it  changes  the  way
you  want  it  to  change.  If  the  child  is  primarily  concerned
with  general  fitness,  choose  a  well-rounded  program  that
concentrates  on  the  major  muscle  groups.  In  addition  to
the  weight  training  routine,  the  program  should  include
endurance and flexibility exercises.

This  is  the  most  important  training  principle.  The  body
adapts  to  stress  in  a  very  specific  way.  For  example,
swimming  will  not  improve  endurance  for  running  or
cycling.  Likewise,  lifting  weights  will  not  “transfer”  and
make  athletes  better  football  players,  discus  throwers,
skiers, or swimmers. The best way to improve performance
in a sport is to practice that particular sport.

Doing  support  exercises  such  as  weight  training,  power
exercises,  and  endurance  training,  eventually  improves
performance in a particular sport. However, improvements
occur  most  readily  when  the  training  combines  specific
skill  practice  with  exercises  for  improved  strength,  power,
flexibility, and endurance.

it  or  not,

Believe
improved  fitness  can  sometimes
temporarily  decrease  performance.  The  nervous  system
programs  sports  skills  very  precisely.  Improving  strength,
power, flexibility, or endurance in a short  time introduces
variability  into  motor  performance;  it  takes  time  for  the
brain to adjust to new capabilities. In the long run, the new
fitness  will  improve  performance.  However,  this  will  only
occur  if  the  nervous  system  can  accommodate  the  new
fitness  into  the  skill.  The  brain  and  nervous  system  must
adjust to the improved fitness.

Rapid  growth  during  adolescence  can  have  similar  effects
on motor performance. Children sometimes grow six inches
or  more  during  the  pubertal  growth  spurt.  This  causes
problems for the precise nervous control systems that direct
movement—they become programmed for a specific weight,
height,  and  strength.  Rapid  growth  confuses  the  system.
A child who was highly skilled in a sport two months ago
can suddenly look like an unskilled novice. After a period
of  adjustment,  the  neural  control  system  “catches  up”  to
the growth and continues to improve motor performance.
Improvement following the growth spurt is not inevitable,
however. In girls, motor performance following the spurt is
sometimes lower than before the growth spurt began.

The  principle  of  specificity  should  be
the  central
consideration in any training program designed to improve

skilled performance. Skill practice in activities such as tennis,
skiing,  golf,  discus  throwing,  football,  volleyball,  soccer,
softball,  and  other  individual  and  group  activities  should
remain  a  central  focus  of  the  program.  Support  activities
designed to improve strength, power, and endurance should
be secondary to skill development.

Physical support activities (e.g., strength and power training)
have  to  be  consistent  and  long-term.  Lifting  weights  for
two  months  before  football  or  track  season  is  practically
worthless. The increased strength does not transfer rapidly
to motor skills. In contrast, a support program that develops
high levels of fitness over a long time can be more effectively
integrated  into  the  sport.  This  will  inject  greater  strength,
power, endurance, and flexibility into the movement skills,
and  performance  improves.  Another  critically  important
factor  about  specificity  of  training  is  that  weight  training,
plyometrics, and speed training transfer to motor skills in
skilled athletes more so than in novices. Consequently, the
personal  trainer  should  work  on  basic  skill  development
in  beginners  before  emphasizing  strength  and  power.  As
athletes  increase  their  individual  skills,  they  should  add
more conditioning exercises to improve sports power.

In  summary,  the  message  behind  this  critical  principle  of
specificity is to train the way you want your body to adapt.
Support activities designed to improve power during sports
movements  create  change  very  slowly.  The  athlete  must
develop  strength,  power,  endurance,  and  flexibility  slowly
and  consistently  in  order  to  integrate  newly  developed
fitness
into  sports  skills.  Improving  fitness  without
practicing the skill will have little or no transfer effects in
terms of a particular sports performance.

Athletes  should  work  on  their  weaknesses,  even  if  the
exercises  necessary  to  correct  them  are  unpleasant.  For
example, in skiers, strong, flexible lower body muscles are
more  important  than  strong  arms  and  shoulders.  Analyze
the  athlete’s  program.  A  well-designed  program  will  be
more  effective  and  less  time-consuming  than  a  casual  or
unsystematic one.

International Sports Sciences Association108  |  unit 8

2. Eat Well-Balanced High
Performance Meals
During  the  past  20  years,  sports  scientists  have  shown
that  the  right  diet  can  improve  performance  and  keep  off
unwanted pounds of fat. All the training in the world will
not  produce  superior  fitness  if  the  athlete  consumes  an
unhealthy  diet.  Children  should  eat  a  sensible,  nutritious
diet  that  contains  a  balance  of  the  basic  food  groups. The
diet  should  supply  enough  calories  to  meet  energy  needs
but still allow the athlete to control their weight. If children
must  lose  weight,  they  should  do  so  gradually—losing  no
more  than  about  two  pounds  per  week.  Along  with  hard
training,  they  should  consume  a  greater  proportion  of
complex carbohydrates and fewer fats.

3. Establish Realistic Goals
Improved  fitness  occurs  when  you  stress  the  body  and  it
adapts. Because of the specificity of training, the nature of
the exercise stress (i.e., training program) must match the
goals.  Goals  should  reflect  the  individual’s  capability  and
motivation. A young girl should not set a goal of being an
Olympic  discus  thrower  if  she  is  short  and  gains  strength
slowly. If a young athlete is willing to put in the necessary
mileage to run a 10k race, she should go ahead and do it.
Otherwise, she should set more modest goals. Goal setting
is discussed in great detail in the next phase of the course
dealing with sports psychology and the young athlete.

It  is  important  to  set  achievable,  short-term  goals.  A
beginning tennis player might set a goal of keeping a rally
going for ten strokes. A beginning golfer might set a short-
term goal of putting the ball in two strokes on 9 of the 18
holes. A beginning runner might set a goal of completing
a  6-mile  fun  run.  A  more  accomplished  athlete  may  set
more difficult goals ranging from running a 6-minute mile
to making the Olympic team. The principle is the same for
everyone—set  achievable  goals.  When  you  attain  them,
reevaluate the program and establish new goals. One new
goal might be to maintain the present level or it could be to
achieve a higher level of performance.

The personal trainer is a critical link for goal setting in young
athletes. You can help them set goals they can achieve. Set
small training goals such as improving 1-inch in the vertical
jump or bench-pressing 10 more pounds. If athletes get in
the  habit  of  working  for  and  achieving  short-term  goals,
they will soon be doing things they never thought possible.
More importantly, they will begin to internalize goal-setting
behavior,  a  critical  component  for  long-term  success  in
sports and in life.

4. Have a Workout Plan
Teach young athletes to write down their goals and a plan for
achieving them. An appropriate plan for an overweight child
would not be to look good in a bathing suit next summer.
The child should write down a program for achieving this
outcome.  For  example,  if  a  young  boy  wants  to  lose  20
pounds of body fat and increase muscle
mass, a realistic program for achieving
this  goal  might  be  to  lose  1  pound  a
week and strive to go to the gym 3 times
a  week.  He  might  achieve  his  goal  by
cutting down on desserts or eliminating
high sugar  drinks (and fats in general)
from  lunch  meals  and  snacks  and,
more importantly, by devoting 30 to 60
minutes or more daily to aerobic exercise
and resistance training. Analysis of the
training programs of successful athletes
shows  that  people  must  devote  at  least
10,000  hours  to  mastering  a  sport.
Think  about  that  fact—10,000  hours
equals 1 year, 1 month, and 21 days of
practice time!

Contrast  this  method  with  a  more
casual  approach.  It  is  January,  and  a
young female is tired of looking bad in
her  swimsuit  during  the  summer.  She
wants  to  lose  20  pounds  of  fat  but  has
no  plan.  She  exercises  and  diets  from

Youth FitnessThe Training Response: Principles of Training & Adaptation  |  109

time-to-time  but  makes  no  progress  because  she
is  inconsistent  in  her  behavior.  Soon,  May  comes
around  and  she  looks  the  same  as  she  did  in  the
wintertime. In desperation, she undertakes a crash
weight loss program and exercise regimen. Despite
great  sacrifice  and  suffering,  she  fails  to  meet  her
goal  and  ends  up  wearing  a  baggy  T-shirt  to  the
beach  (or  simply  chooses  not  to  go  to  the  beach
with her friends). Sadly, this happens all too often.
Without  clear-cut  goal  setting,  the  chances  are
nearly nil of achieving well-intentioned goals.

In  setting  up  a  good  workout  plan,  analyze  the
elements  necessary  for  achieving  the  client’s  goal.
For example, if the client wants to be a better skier,
he  or  she  must  practice  skiing  and  develop  good
endurance, strength, power, and flexibility. During
the  off-season,  the  client  should  systematically
improve physical fitness. Once the ski season comes
around, shift emphasis to skill development without
compromising fitness.

The  football  player  should  follow  a  similar
procedure. After football season, begin a program
designed  to  increase  muscle  mass  and  improve
power output capacity. Encourage weight training
designed to stress the body’s major muscles. Have the client
do  flexibility  and  endurance  exercises  to  improve  overall
fitness. In the spring, integrate more power training into the
program such as plyometrics and speed exercises. During
the  summer,  shift  the  training  emphasis  to  maintaining
strength and maximizing power, speed, and skill.

Contrast this systematic approach with the more common
crash  weight  training  program  started  two  months  before
the football season. The athlete might gain in strength, but
little improvement occurs in power, speed, or football skills.
The  athlete  has  wasted  the  two  critical  months  before  the
season doing exercises that should have been done during
the winter.

It is important to keep a training diary. Top athletes create
a  comprehensive,  written,  week-by-week  plan  that  clearly
defines  what  they  will  do  on  any  given  day  of  the  week.
Top athletes also keep check lists and stay focused on their
workout  regimen.  Once  it  is  established,  following  a  path
toward  pre-established  goals  truly  becomes  “easy.”  This  is
the best way of insuring a systematic approach.

Athletes  should  write  down  their  programs  for  the  next
four to six weeks and follow their progress in their training
diary. The diary does not have to be anything fancy; tell your
client  to  go  to  the  stationary  store  and  buy  a  small  spiral
notebook. Then, tell him to put it in his gym bag and carry
it with him to every workout. He should record such things
as body weight, how he feels each day, exercises (set, reps,

load),  morning  heart  rate,  and  performances  (scores  of
tennis matches, times of intervals, vertical jump distances,
and so on). He should write down tentative workouts in the
training diary for the next six weeks. He also should write
down a rough workout plan for the next year. Writing down
the plan in the training diary will help any athlete get where
he or she wants to be in the next month and the next year.

The training diary is an important part of being consistent
in workouts. Training diaries (kept either in a notebook or
in a record keeping computer program in a word processor
or spreadsheet or on a smartphone) are essential to anyone
committed  to  fitness—whether  the  person  is  a  serious
athlete or simply an individual who wants to get into good
shape. Have your clients start their training diaries today!

5. Train all year round
Athletes  who  take  too  much  time  off  from  their  exercise
program lose the gains they have made. They also become
more susceptible to injury if they try to get back in shape
rapidly.  Establish  a  year-round  program  for  your  clients;
have  specific  goals  and  procedures  for  each  period  of  the
year—and see to it that the athlete sticks to them. Younger
children should do a variety of activities to develop a love
for sport and a well-rounded fitness program.

Make sure your charges have alternative training plans for
bad weather and for times when they do not have access to
a weight room or playing field. For example, if they are on

International Sports Sciences Association110  |  unit 8

a trip, they can substitute calisthenics exercises—push-ups
and knee bends—for the regular routine.

exercise are introduced gradually, individuals will eventually
become fit and the risk of injury will be reduced.

Most  young  athletes  do  not  train  all  year  long.  Rather,
they train for each sport as it comes. This is not a problem
for  younger  kids.  However,  high  school  athletes  should
develop a training discipline that allows them to maintain
their fitness during the off-season. Great athletes are made
during  the  off-season.  An  athlete  cannot  develop  superior
performance  during  a  season  with  a  duration  of  only  two
to three months.

Athletes  who  miss  workouts  do  not  improve  their  fitness,
and they can even lose the gains they have achieved. Teach
athletes to plan regular times for their exercise programs and
stick to them. Encourage them not to let outside influences
interfere with workouts. All of us have many responsibilities
that  compete  for  our  time.  If  fitness  and  performance  are
important, workouts must be a priority. Teach clients that
workouts are their time and that they should not let others
take this important time away from them.

6. Get in Shape Gradually
Achieving fitness requires a gradual process of adaptation.
Athletes  who  try  to  increase  fitness  too  quickly  become
injured or overtrained. Do not push the process. High levels
of fitness represent many small adaptations. If the stresses of

Many sports programs—particularly in high school and even
junior high school—employ crash exercise programs known
by  names  such  as  “hell-week”  or  “double  days.”  Research
studies are unanimous in showing that such programs are
not only ineffective, but they cause unnecessary fatigue and
often lead to injury. One cannot “force” the body to become
fit overnight, no matter how hard one works. Attempts to do
so almost always backfire and lead to injury and depressed
immune function. Overtraining makes it more difficult for
the body to fight disease. Instead of achieving a high fitness
level, athletes end up trying to compete with a cold or flu
and  muscles  so  sore  they  have  trouble  moving  effectively.
Contrast  this  with  a  year-long  program  that  gradually
develops  fitness.  Fit  people  are  capable  of  high  levels  of
injury-free performance because they have approached the
conditioning process gradually.

Unfortunately, most young athletes do not train consistently
year  round,  which  presents  coaches  and  trainers  with  a
dilemma: how can they prepare their team for competition
in a short time? The answer—unfortunately—is two-a-day
practices. As a personal trainer, insist that your athletes are
fit  for  competition.  Remember,  successful  athletes  are  built
during the off-season.

Youth FitnessThe Training Response: Principles of Training & Adaptation  |  111

Training represents a stress the body must overcome, so the
body requires time to adapt to the stress of exercise. Muscles
are  more  susceptible  to  injury  during  the  early  phases  of
conditioning. Overzealous training, or intense conditioning
when the athlete is ill–prepared for it, will most likely lead to
injury and delay progress toward the person’s goals.

Staying in “good shape” all year long is easier than trying to
achieve fitness in a few months. It is easier to apply a little
pressure instead of trying to undertake a crash-conditioning
program within a relatively brief period.

7. Do Not Train When Ill or
Seriously Injured
The body has problems trying to fight more than one stressor
at  a  time.  Training  when  sick  or  injured  may  seriously
hinder  progress  or  even  be  dangerous.  It  is  particularly
important not to train with a fever (above 100°F). After an
injury,  athletes  can  return  to  intense  workouts  if  they  can
answer, “yes” to the following four questions.

1.  Can you move the injured area normally

(joint or muscle)?

2.  Do you have normal strength and power?

3.  Have normal movement patterns been restored

(more than 90 percent recovered)?

4.  Are you relatively pain free?

If  the  answer  to  any  of  these  questions  is  “no,”  then  the
athlete  should  let  the  injury  heal  through  a  combination
of rehabilitation and rest, or modify the training program
before resuming the normal workout. Many people end up
abandoning their favorite sports because they have injuries
that were not allowed to heal properly due to insufficient rest
and rehabilitation. Dealing effectively with injuries is just as
important as creating a well-designed training program.

8. Train First for Volume (More Rep-
etitions) and Only Later for Intensity
(More Weight or Resistance)
This  principle  seems  to  be  at  odds  with  the  principle  of
specificity.  As  a  tennis  player  or  skier,  you  might  ask,
“Why  would  I  want  to  develop  aerobic  capacity  and
muscle endurance if power output and speed are the most
important  fitness  components?”  The  answer  is  that  low-
intensity, repetitive exercise prepares the body to withstand
more intensive training with less risk of injury.

High intensity training to develop power and speed pushes
the  body  to  its  limits.  If  you  first  develop  a  “fitness  base”
and  then  increase  training  intensity  gradually,  you  will

develop power and speed with less risk of strains, sprains,
and muscle cramps.

tendons,

tissues—muscles,

The  soft
ligaments,  and
connective  tissue—take  a  relatively  long  time  to  adjust  to
the rigors of training. If it is the athlete’s goal is to become
as  strong  as  possible,  begin  the  program  by  doing  more
repetitions,  not  adding  more  weight.  This  will  prevent
injury,  strengthen  the  body  gradually,  and  prepare  it  for
sustained, heavier training.

During later training sessions, when the athlete has achieved
a  respectable  fitness  level,  she  can  add  more  weight  and
perform  fewer  repetitions  to  increase  strength  at  a  faster
rate. If the goal is to create good muscle tone and muscular
endurance,  the  athlete  should  perform  more  repetitions
instead of emphasizing lifting a heavier weight.

International Sports Sciences Association112  |  unit 8

overtraining: Imbalance be-
tween training and recovery.

9. Listen to Your Body
Athletes should not adhere to the planned program too stubbornly if it does not feel right.
Sometimes  the  body  requires  rest  more  than  it  needs  exercise.  Most  research  studies
show that the absolute intensity is the essential factor for fitness improvement. Typically,
an overtrained person has not recovered enough to train at an optimal intensity; thus,
a  few  days  rest  is  sometimes  necessary  to  provide  enough  recovery  to  allow  for  more
intense training in the following days. The hallmark “signals” of overtraining to watch
for and be aware of include fatigue, decreased performance, irritability, poor sleep, and
sometimes depression.

Overtraining reflects an imbalance between training and recovery. Many active people
live by the motto “no pain, no gain.” Athletes must work hard to achieve high levels of
fitness. Too much training or training that is too intense is counterproductive.

Effective training occurs only if the body adapts positively to the stress of exercise. This
adaptation occurs following the exercise or training workout. If the body does not get the
chance to adapt, it will not become stronger, faster or demonstrate improved endurance.
Instead, fitness development comes to a halt, and the person may become injured or sick.

Proper rest is just as important as intense training to improve fitness. When you work
out, you are trying to get your body to adapt and improve its many functions. Before
every workout, ask this question: “What is the purpose of this exercise session, and how
will it cause my body to adapt?” If you are exhausted or have the flu, the workout may
cause you to regress. You are better off resting for a day or two. When you come back, you
will be ready for an intense workout that helps to improve fitness. Teach young athletes
that improved fitness requires a sensible balance of training and rest.

Exercise training is not an exact science. Sometimes you feel great and can train more
intensely  than  you  had  planned.  Other  times,  you  feel  tired  and  sluggish.  To  train
intensely during these times impedes progress.

Athletes should not use this principle as an excuse to skip workouts. If you listen to your
body and it always tells you to rest, you will never improve fitness. Encourage athletes
to follow a systematic program but be flexible enough to change it slightly according to
how they feel. They should train consistently. They have to work very hard to improve
fitness significantly. It is essential to try to maintain a structured workout program. If an
athlete never feels like training hard, he or she may have a medical problem or simply a
lack motivation.

10. Vary the Volume and Intensity of Workouts
Fitness  components  such  as  speed  and  power  improve  best  with  intense  training.
However, it is extremely difficult to recover from too many intense workouts. Athletes
must balance rest and moderate intensity workouts with high intensity exercise sessions.

If you design the program properly, you can actually plan for effective, intense workout
sessions. This requires considerable trial and error. For example, you might balance an
intense interval training session with a day of rest followed by a more moderate interval
training workout. When the athlete does the next intense interval training workout, he or
she will be recovered enough to train at 100 percent. Recognize compulsive athletes who
believe they must train hard daily so they will “not lose” previous gains. This is simply a
not true.

The same principle applies to weight training. Do not exercise at maximum intensity every
time you go into the gym. Most people cannot do maximum large muscle exercises such
as squats, cleans, and bench presses at every workout. Emphasize one or two exercises

Youth FitnessThe Training Response: Principles of Training & Adaptation  |  113

each training session. One time, train intensely on the squat; next time emphasize the
bench press, clean, or functional training exercises.

There is no need to perform the same exercises every workout. To develop maximum
strength  and  power,  perform  shoulder  press  exercises—such  as  the  bench  press—and
pulling  exercises—such  as  cleans  and  snatches—two  times  a  week.  Do  squats  three
times in two weeks. Alternate between intense and moderate workouts for each exercise.
This method insures a proper balance between intense and moderate workouts and the
important rest intervals. Make sure the athlete uses proper technique when squatting or
lifting weights from the floor. Poor technique, particularly using heavy weights, leads to
injury and interferes with progress.

Cycle interval training workouts (for athletes who practice this type of training). Perform
interval training two to three times a week. On interval training days, do shorter, more
intense  workouts  on  some  days,  and  longer,  less  intense  intervals  on  other  days.  Do
over-distance  workouts  (longer  distances  at  a  slower  pace)  between  interval  training
workouts or rest. When doing interval training workouts, make sure to rest completely
(no exercise) one to two days a week.

This technique is sometimes called periodization or cycle training. It allows the body
to recover more fully and to train hard when intense training is called for. The principle
is simple: you should perform a particular exercise more intensely in one workout than
in  another  rather  than  training  at  maximum  intensity  for  every  exercise  during  every
weight training session.

Although sophisticated workout cycles are most suitable for athletes, non-athletes can
also benefit from such workouts because it allows the body to adapt and become stronger
more rapidly. Cycle training is beneficial if the goal is to improve muscle tone and body
composition (decrease the proportion of fat and increase fat-free weight). Try varying
the exercises in workouts. For example, instead of doing bench presses three days a week,
substitute  kettlebell  snatches  one  day.  Cycle  training  makes  working  out  with  weights
more interesting and speeds up progress.

periodization: Cycling the vol-
ume and intensity of training to
maximize the rate of adaptation.

11. Work on Athletes’
Weaknesses
The inscription etched in marble on the
facades  of  many  libraries  in  America
(and  the  Temple  of  Apollo  in  Greece
at  the  Oracle  at  Delphi)  is  “Know
Thyself.”  Builders
should  probably
put  that  inscription  over  the  entrance
of  the  local  gym,  too.  Analyze  your
athletes’  weaknesses  and  correct  them
systematically.  You  can  do  this  only  if
you establish goals—then systematically
assess
capability  of
achieving them.

athlete’s

the

You  do  not  need  a  degree  in  exercise
physiology to do this. Start with sports
skills.  If  the  young  person  wants  to
be  a  good  skier,  volleyball  player,  or
golfer, assess whether or not their skills
are  sufficient  to  allow  them  to  achieve

International Sports Sciences Association114  |  unit 8

the goal. Coaches and instructors should focus on helping
young athletes develop good sports and activity skills.

Next, assess fitness. Is the person strong or flexible enough?
As  discussed,  a  good  way  to  assess  physical  readiness  for
a  sport  is  to  compare  the  athlete  with  successful  people
in the sport at the level he or she hopes to achieve. Good
recreational skiers or tennis players should have the speed
and  stamina  of  people  who  compete  at  that  level.  If  an
athlete wants to be a professional football player or Olympic
shotputter,  he  should  possess  strength  and  power  levels
similar to successful athletes or he will not achieve such a
goal, no matter how much practice and time he devotes to
training and practice.

Does the athlete have any injuries that have not healed? You
can often relieve chronic back, knee, and ankle pain with a
systematic exercise program. Rather than making excuses,
have  a  physician,  physical  therapist,  or  athletic  trainer
evaluate the injury and start a rehabilitation program that
will set the athlete on the road to recovery. Do not take the
word of a friend or acquaintance about what doctor is “best”
for treating a particular injury. Seek out professionals in the
area and ask their opinion. The surgical nurse in the hospital
operating room knows who the “best” doctors are. Ask them
to whom they would go for advice or surgery. Follow up by
doing your homework. You must take charge when it comes
to medical care—you want to seek out only the best, and to
do so, you must be prepared to ask questions and interview
those whom you will deal with. If you break your arm, and
you  have  a  choice  between  a  general  practitioner  and  an
arm specialist, who is more likely to do a better job setting
the  bone?  The  general  practitioner  might  set  the  bone  as
well as the orthopedic surgeon who specializes in arms, but
for my money, I would choose the specialist to set the bone.
And so should you.

12. Train Systematically
Plan a proper workout schedule for the coming months, but
do not be so rigid that you cannot change the program to
fit unforeseen circumstances. The most important point is
to have a plan so the athlete’s fitness improves comfortably
and consistently.

A  coach,  training  partner,  and  training  diary  will  help
keep  workouts  more  systematic.  A  knowledgeable  and
experienced  coach  or  instructor  can  prevent  common
mistakes and help motivate the athlete to meet fitness goals.
A personal trainer is trained to help clients make rapid gains.

A  training  partner  is  important  for  motivation  and
safety.  It  is  easier  to  attend  workouts  if  young  athletes  are
accountable to someone. A training partner can give them
encouragement and help spot them when they need help (a
spotter assists during the exercise). He or she will share the
agony and ecstasy that accompanies training.

13. Warm Up and Cool Down
Muscles  work  best  when  they  are  slightly  warmer  than  at
rest and have plenty of blood. Warming up before exercise
increases muscle temperature, muscle and heart blood flow,
tissue  elasticity,  joint  lubrication,  and  provides  additional
“purposeful”  practice  before  competing  or  beginning
formal  practice.  Cooling  down  helps  to  gradually  restore
normal resting blood flow levels to the inner organs.

14. Train the Mind
One of the most difficult skills to acquire—but one critical
for attaining high levels of physical fitness—is mind control.
Training the mind is thoroughly interrelated with training
the body. Young athletes can achieve almost anything if they
set their mind to it. To become physically fit and to succeed
as  an  athlete,  they  must  believe  in  themselves  and  their
potential, have goals, and know how to achieve the goals. It
requires discipline and is an ongoing process. They must be
able to put themselves in the proper frame of mind in order
to do this.

Consistent training is the key to developing fitness, and it
takes discipline. Many young athletes want instant results.
Unfortunately, fitness comes only after countless small steps.
Gains are balanced with temporary setbacks and periods of
stagnation.  Teach  athletes  to  develop  the  self-discipline  to
train consistently if they want to improve performance and
fitness for sports and exercise.

Make training a priority. Help young people develop enough
mental toughness and discipline to go to the gym, swimming
pool,  or  track  regularly.  Do  not  let  them  procrastinate.
They should go to workouts and get them over with. Often,
kids  put  off  going  to  the  gym.  Consequently,  they  end  up
wasting a lot of time. By the time they spend time thinking
about going to the work-out, finally going to the gym, and
“lollygagging” around when they get there, they have wasted
two to three hours. Instead, they could have just gone to the
workout, finished it efficiently, and then returned home in
about an hour. Help young athletes to develop the mental
strength and discipline to exercise regularly.

Youth FitnessThe Training Response: Principles of Training & Adaptation  |  115

15. Listen to “Coach Pain”
Good technique does not hurt! Athletes will have little joint
or muscle pain if they perform sports movements correctly.
Back, shoulder, and elbow pain are usually due to improper
biomechanics.  Children  with  sports  related  pain  usually
have defects in their technique or training program. Pain is
a good indicator that something is wrong with the program
or their technique.

16. Learn All You Can About Exercise
If  you  know  why  the  various  components  of  training  are
important, you are much more likely to plan an intelligent,
effective program. You will be less liable to jump into every
training fad that comes along and will always be in control
of  your  own  training  program.  Being  informed,  you  will
buy better and more economical sports equipment, manage
many of your own athletic injuries, and have a more efficient
training routine. You need to learn everything you can about
your body and training to get the most from your exercise
program, and you must encourage your young clients to do
the same thing.

A  recurring  theme  of  this  course  is  that  exercise  training
is  as  much  art  as  science.  The  more  that  athletes  (and
personal trainers) learn about the art and science of training
and  movements  skills,  the  sooner  they  can  benefit  from  a
program that works and helps them to achieve their goals.

Encourage youngsters to read books and magazine articles
about training and their sport. Some of this information will
be contradictory or of poor quality. That’s okay. With time,
they  will  learn  to  filter  and  extract  useful  information  to
improve their training program and skills.

17. Have Fun! Keep the Exercise
Program in Its Proper Perspective
Too often, sports training programs are overemphasized in
a  child’s  life.  Some  kids  think  of  themselves  almost  solely
as  football  players,  aerobic  dancers,  runners,  triathletes,
or  swimmers,  rather  than  as  child  participants  in  those
activities. While exercise is important, the child also must
have  time  for  other  aspects  of  their  lives.  Leading  a  well-
rounded life does not diminish chances for later success and
will  make  any  training  program  more  enjoyable.  Let  kids
be  kids.  Keep  the  activity  fun.  Even  highly  motivated  and
successful young athletes need more than just sports. They
should strive for success but keep balance in their lives.

An  old  saying  among  exercise  critics  is  “Exercise  does
not  make  you  live  any  longer;  it  just  seems  longer!”  The
program  does  not  have  to  be  a  chore  if  the  participants
choose activities they enjoy. If they like sports but despise
jogging, encourage them to play tennis instead of running
on  a  treadmill  in  the  gym.  If  working  out  with  friends
helps motivate them, they should consider participating in
aerobics classes at the local health club.

Children’s club sports are extremely popular and are available
for  young  people  ranging  in  age  from  4  to  18.  Training
for  soccer,  t-ball,  baseball,  track  and  field,  volleyball,
swimming, fun runs, cycling races, or softball adds purpose
and  enjoyment  to  the  exercise  program.  Children  do  not
need  to  be  potential  Olympic  champions  to  participate  in
these  sports.  Participation  in  fun  physical  activities  gives
purpose to workouts.

International Sports Sciences Association116  |  unit 8

SuMMARY

The basic principles of training are similar for beginning exercisers, more experi-
enced people, children, and adults. Fitness improves when the body is given an
unaccustomed exercise stress such as walking instead of sitting, lifting a heavier
weight, running faster or farther, or stretching a muscle more than usual. The
body adapts to the stress by improving its function. The stress must be sufficient
to trigger adaptation but not so intense that it causes injury and overtraining.
Five factors that influence training adaptations include the degree of overload,
specificity of training, individual differences (genetics), progression, and reversibil-
ity. Children can attain high levels of fitness, but few will become professional or
Olympic athletes. All children should develop a love of sport and physical activity.
The personal trainer plays an important role in helping kids to develop a positive
attitude toward exercise and sport.

Endurance sports are relatively new to children. It is not unusual to watch kids as young
as  8  or  10  compete  in  long  distance  running,  triathlons,  and  endurance  swimming.
Endurance sports carry both risks and benefits for young people.

Many  American  children  are  overweight  or  obese.  Playing  endurance  sports  provides
an excellent way of cutting fat and preventing long-term degenerative diseases such as
coronary artery disease. Endurance sports require more training discipline than soccer,
football,  or  tennis,  however,  and  many  kids  do  not  have  the  psychological  makeup  to
contend with the intense training required in these sports.

Endurance sports such as swimming, track and field, cycling, cross-country skiing, and
rowing  offer  competitive  opportunities  for  children  as  young  as  age  five.  Clubs  offer
training geared to everyone from beginners to elite athletes. Training for these sports can
be intense and time consuming and require a considerable time commitment from the
child and parents. Table 9.1 lists a selection of Internet resources for locating clubs for
endurance sports.

Youth FitnessEndurance Fitness  |  121

It  is  very  important  to  avoid  overtraining  when  working
with young athletes who want to participate in endurance
events.  Children  cannot  develop  the  same  amount  of
muscle power as adults, and they fatigue more easily when
exercising  intensely.  The  epiphyses  (bone  growth  centers)
are also vulnerable to intense exercise. Trouble signs include
chronic  fatigue,  pain  under  or  below  the  kneecap,  and
shoulder pain.

gOALS
When  working  with  a  young  client,  start  by  setting  goals.
Does  the  child  need  to  exercise  to  improve  health?  Is  the
goal fitness-enhanced sports performance, or does the child
want to want to run, bike, or swim faster just for the sake
of  doing  it?  Be  honest  and  set  realistic  goals  that  can  be
achieved with a reasonable program.

MEASuRINg
ENDuRANCE FITNESS
Measurement  should  become  a  critical  aspect  of  every
personal  trainer’s  program.  You  will  never  know  if  the
program is effective if you cannot measure progress. Use a
simple  endurance  test  such  as  the  1-mile  run,  the  Cooper
12-minute run, or the 6-mile bike test. For athletes in non-
running endurance sports, select a test specific to the child’s
activity. For example, use a cycling test if he rides bikes or
a swimming test if she is a swimmer. Basic fitness tests are
described in Unit 14 of the course.

bASIC ENDuRANCE
FITNESS FOR hEALTh

The  Centers
for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention
recommends  that  children  6  to  17  years  old  should  do  at
least 60 minutes of physical activity daily—mostly aerobic
exercise.  Three  days  a  week,  children  should  also  include
exercises to build bone and muscle (e.g., gymnastics or rope
skipping). They do not have to do all the exercises at once—
time  spent  walking  briskly,  climbing  stairs,  bike  riding  to
and  from  school,  and  playing  sports  easily  adds  up  to  60
minutes or more per day.

Encourage kids to become more active in everything they
do.  For  example,  suggest  they  play  basketball  after  school
instead  of  video  games.  When  you  take  the  kids  to  the
supermarket, park in the farthest reaches of the parking lot
and  take  a  short  walk  to  the  store.  Have  them  wash  your
car  by  hand  instead  of  running  it  through  the  car  wash.
Encourage them to take the dog for a walk every evening. In
short, encourage them to move more and sit less.

Children  can  increase  fitness  through  ordinary  activities
such as walking to school instead of riding in a car, playing
after  school  sports,  and  doing  physically  active  pursuits
instead  of  browsing  the  Internet  or  playing  static  video
games. The newer generation of video games offers excellent
opportunities  for  challenging  physical  activities  through
fitness-oriented games.

Children will most likely achieve the goal of 60 minutes of
activity a day if exercise is scheduled on a daily basis. Until

meeting the suggested amount
of physical activity.

recently,  health  experts  believed  that  for  exercise  to  have  health  benefits,  individuals
needed to exercise vigorously for up to 60 minutes three to seven days a week. While
those  are  desirable  goals,  benefits  can  occur  from  less  intense  activity.  Given  human
nature, however, most children will not devote much time to physical activity unless it is
scheduled or “programmed.” To ensure that children accomplish the goal of endurance
fitness for health, set aside a specific time for a daily walk, run, swim, bike, or other fun-
type activity.

A useful guideline to help individuals determine the proper amount of exercise is the
“Activity  Pyramid.” Everyone should attempt to increase activities at the base of the
pyramid. Children should try to become more active during everyday activities. If they
are  participating  in  a  structured  exercise  program,  try  to  encourage  more  consistent
activities in the middle of the pyramid. For faithful exercisers, add variety to the program
by including recreational sports. Kids should minimize sedentary activities like watching
TV, playing computer games, and prolonged sitting.

cross–training: Including
more than one kind of exercise
in the training program.

ENDuRANCE PROgRAM FOR PERFOR-
MANCE–LEvEL PhYSICAL FITNESS
The  basic  program  described  above  contributes  to  health  and  reduces  the  chances  of
heart disease. However, it is not enough exercise if children want to get in shape for their
favorite sports or to control unwanted body fat. To achieve those goals, they must go on
a structured exercise program that carefully considers the type, duration, intensity, and
frequency of exercise. Regular vigorous exercise provides benefits beyond what can be
achieved with a basic 60-minutes-a-day program.

TYPe oF exercISe
The best exercises for developing significant endurance fitness
are  those  that  engage  large  muscle  groups  repeatedly  for  at
least 20 minutes (30 to 60 minutes is preferable). These include
walking,  jogging,  vigorous  dancing,  cross-country  skiing,
swimming,  and  cycling.  Soccer,  basketball,  and  tennis  also
develop  endurance  if  children  are  skilled  and  participate  for
prolonged periods.

Select exercises that can be done regularly. Do not select cross-
country skiing as the main form of exercise if the child lives
in Florida and can only ski on vacation. If young athletes like
to  run  but  live  in  a  congested  urban  area  where  jogging  is
difficult or dangerous, perhaps they could run on a treadmill,
do stationary cycling, or pursue other forms of “large muscle”
activity for 30 to 60 minutes at a time at a local fitness facility.

Cross–training  is  a  desirable  training  method.  It  involves  combining  more  than  one
type of endurance exercise in the program at a time. Including multiple exercises such
as swimming and running, stair-stepping, and cycling adds variety to workouts. Also, it
prepares young people for a greater variety of physical challenges.

Be aware that if the athlete wants to excel at any single activity, though, cross–training will
hamper progress. As with any type of movement, performances in endurance exercises
are  highly  specific.  Adaptations  from  running  differ  from  those  gained  in  swimming,
cycling,  or  walking.  In  fact,  training  for  one  activity  may  interfere  with  progress  in
another “almost similar” activity.

This  level  of  stress  initiates  changes  in  the  heart,  lungs,  circulation,  and  cells.  These
changes improve the body’s ability to transport oxygen and use fuels during exercise.

Exercise heart rate can serve as a measure of exercise intensity. A given percentage of
maximum heart rate during exercise will be approximately 10 percent higher than the
percentage of maximal oxygen consumption. For example, exercising at 50 percent of

target heart rate: Desirable

multiplying the maximum heart

and 0.9, which sets the exercise
intensity between 60 and 90
percent of maximum effort.

heart rate monitor: Electronic
device worn on the body to
measure heart rate during
exercise.

Determine  the  maximum  heart  rate  for  purposes  of  using  heart  rate  as  a  measure  of
exercise intensity. Maximum heart rate is most accurately measured during a treadmill
test  conducted  in  a  hospital  or  exercise  laboratory.  Nonetheless,  a  rough  estimate  of
maximum  heart  rate  can  be  obtained  by  subtracting  the  person’s  age  from  220.  For
example, for a 16-year-old, the predicted maximum heart rate is 204 beats per minute
(220‒16 = 204).

This  technique  approximates  maximum  heart  rate;  however,  an  individual  athlete’s
maximum  heart  rate  may  vary  from  this  considerably.  The  standard  deviation  (a
measure of variability) for maximum heart rate is about ±12 beats a minute. This means
if the predicted max heart rate is 200 bpm, then the actual heart rate may be as high as
212 or as low as 188 in most people.

Measuring the exercise heart rate provides an estimate of training intensity. People can
achieve an endurance training effect when their heart rate reaches 55/65 to 90 percent of
maximum heart rate. This range of heart rates is called the target heart rate. The target
heart rate corresponds to an increased metabolic rate that causes the body to improve
its fitness. Use 55 percent as the lower value if the child is unfit and 65 percent as the
lower value if he or she is fit and physically active. Calculate target heart rate range by
multiplying the maximum heart rate first by either 0.55 or 0.65 (depending on fitness
level) and then by 0.9. These two heart rates represent the upper and lower limits of the
ideal exercise intensity.

You can measure exercise heart rate with a heart rate monitor and quantify exercise
output with a hand-held GPS. Prices for these instruments range from less than $100
to more than $500. They are unnecessary for the average person (unless they thrive on
gadgets), but this is a good purchase for the personal trainer. It helps to gauge exercise
intensity and provides scientific credibility.

You can estimate exercise heart rate by taking the pulse rate for 10 seconds immediately
after  the  child  stops  exercising.  For  example,  suppose  you  are  jogging  around  the
neighborhood and have to stop at a red light. Take your pulse for ten seconds and multiply
the value by six to obtain the exercise heart rate. For example, if you count 20 beats in
10 seconds, your exercise heart rate corresponds to 120 beats per minute (20 X 6 = 120).

Do not worry too much if exercise heart rate varies slightly from the target heart rate. As
long as individuals exercise at a vigorous pace they can reasonably sustain for more than
20 minutes, they will improve their fitness. They will not, however, make much progress
if  training  intensity  is  too  low.  Likewise,  individuals  can  become  injured  if  they  train
consistently at close to maximum intensity. You must teach clients to “feel” the correct
training pace. Teach them that if they feel exhausted from training too intensely, they
should slow down next time. If they feel they are stagnating, they should try upping the
pace or intensity.

Heart rate response to exercise is exercise specific—in other words, one cannot compare
a  heart  rate  achieved  during  swimming  with  a  heart  rate  achieved  during  running.
The stresses of swimming, running, and cycling are somewhat different. For example,
swimming occurs in a horizontal position, but running is performed upright. Also, water
pressure  triggers  a  reflex  that  slows  the  heart  rate. Thus,  the  same  relative  increase  in
metabolic rate produces a lower heart rate during swimming than cycling or running.

Two  other  simple  techniques  for  assessing  proper  training  intensity  include  the  talk
test and the rated perceived exertion (RPE) test. With RPE (Table 9.2), children learn
to associate a given exercise intensity on the RPE scale with how they feel during the
exercise. In general, the child should try to exercise at a perceived intensity from hard

to very hard (between 5 and 8 on the scale). The talk test
also  can  help  individuals  to  exercise  at  an  intensity  that
improves endurance yet minimizes injury risk. This test can
be applied during running or cycling but obviously cannot
be  used  during  swimming.  With  this  technique,  have
young athletes exercise at the fastest pace at which they can
comfortably carry on a conversation. This will correspond
to approximately 70 to 80 percent of maximum heart rate—
right about at the target heart rate.

TraInIng duraTIon
As  discussed  previously,  benefits  are  derived  from  even
brief exercise sessions lasting only a few minutes. However,
significant  improvements  in  endurance  fitness  occur  only
with  sustained  exercise  workouts  of  20  to  60  minutes  or
more. Changes in cell metabolic capacity require continuous
exercise.  Although  children  can  improve  by  training
intensely for short periods (i.e., interval training), this type

Endurance Fitness  |  125

of training is uncomfortable and increases the risk of injury.
Also, long-slow distance workouts can be a pleasant break
for athletes involved in intense programs.

TraInIng FrequencY
Encourage  young  people  to  engage  in  a  minimum  of
60  minutes  of  accumulated  moderate-intensity  physical
activity  daily.  No  excuses.  However,  practice  intense
training  only  three  to  five  days  a  week.  Training  more
frequently greatly enhances the risk of overuse injuries and
overtraining. Overtraining, an imbalance between training
and recovery, can produce chronic fatigue and suppression
of the immune system (children become sick more often),
hormone abnormalities, and psychological depression.

Always  remember  the  purpose  of  training:  to  stress  the
body so that it adapts and improves its function. Rest can
be as important as intense training. The process of exercise
training involves stress, followed by recovery, during which
the body becomes more fit. Without proper recovery, many
of the body’s support systems quickly deteriorate.

over-dISTance TraInIng
Over-distance  training  involves  exercising  for  sustained
periods.  For  the  beginner,  over-distance  training  might
involve  walking  for  30  minutes,  five  times  a  week.  A
dedicated jogger might go for a 1-hour run, while a serious
swimmer  might  swim  3000  yards.  Over-distance  training
for a bicyclist might include a 25-mile ride to the next town.
The cross-country skier might ski a 5 to 10 mile loop. People
who  are  serious  about  over  distance  training  typically
exercise  3  to  6  days  per  week.  Training  more  frequently
usually  leads  to  overuse  injuries.  Training  less  frequently
can also lead to injury—plus it is less effective for building
high levels of endurance.

from chemical damage from free radicals. Free radicals are
chemicals  produced  during  normal  metabolism  that  are
like “biological rust.” Free radicals have been linked to cell
membrane breakdown, genetic damage, illness, and aging.

To increase pace and speed during endurance exercise, the
young  athlete  should  practice  interval  training.  Interval
training  builds  aerobic  capacity  quickly.  However,  because
of its high intensity, it is uncomfortable and increases injury
risk. Interval training is most appropriate for older children.

interval training: High
intensity training technique
that varies load, repetition,
distance, and rest using a variety
of exercises such as swimming,
running, and cycling.

InTerval TraInIng
Interval training involves performing repeated exercises at set distances or times. This
type of training helps the body to move at faster speeds by training the nervous system
to react more quickly, increasing the heart’s effectiveness by pumping more blood, and
helping cells cope with rapid metabolism.

One can apply interval training concepts to almost any type of exercise and even motor
skills. For example, a middle distance runner might do repeated bouts of 400-meter runs
at 90 to 100 percent of maximum effort. The boxer or fighter might hit the punching bag
for fifteen, one-minute intervals with one-minute rest breaks between exercise punching
sessions. The swimmer might swim 100 meters at 90 percent effort for 15 repetitions with
3 minutes rest between intervals.

Interval training has four main components: (1) distance, (2) repetitions, (3) intensity, and
(4) rest. Distance refers to either the distance or time of the exercise interval. Repetition
refers to the number of times the exercise is repeated, and intensity corresponds to the
exercise speed. Rest is the amount of time between exercises.

Each  of  the  four  interval  training  factors  relates  to  each  of  the  others.  In  general,  the
more intense the exercise, the fewer the repetitions and the more rest that is required.
For example, a runner performing 400-meter runs at 100 percent of maximum intensity
(speed) might only manage 4 to 6 repetitions. A child exercising at only 75 percent of
maximum intensity might manage 8 to 15 repetitions.

In general, children should not practice interval training more than three days a week.
This type of training can be exhausting and easily lead to injury. Base the volume and
intensity of the interval training workout on the child’s capacity to recover. If he or she is
overly tired training three days per week, cut back to one to two days per week. Likewise,
if  the  child  feels  good,  try  increasing  the  workout  intensity  or  volume  and  see  what
happens. The best advice is to begin slowly and progress conservatively.

Youth FitnessEndurance Fitness  |  127

do intervals running backwards, and soccer players can do
intervals running zigzag patterns.

The  general  principle  for  an  interval  training  program
design is to examine the physical requirements of the sport,
and then pattern the interval training program to meet the
athlete’s immediate needs and longer-term goals.

Interval Training for Swimming
Interval  training  for  swimming  follows  the  same  basic
principles  as  interval  training  for  running  and  cycling.  In
swimming, however, speed does not decrease with distance
to the same extent as in running or cycling. In swimming,
the muscles simply cannot sustain a higher velocity.

The four variables in interval training for swimming include
the number of swims, the distance of each swim, the speed
of the swims, and the rest interval between swims. Interval
distances  vary  in  length  between  25  meters  (one  length
of  a  standard  pool)  and  increase  from  there.  A  typical
interval training workout for swimming might include ten
repetitions of 100 meters (4 lengths of a 25 meter pool) with
30 to 60 seconds rest between repetitions.

As  with  other  forms  of  exercise,  start  slowly.  Begin
swimming  25-meter  intervals.  Gradually  add  distance
as  the  athlete  improves  her  fitness.  For  example,  start  by
swimming five repetitions of 25 meters at about 90 percent
effort. Gradually increase the number of repetitions to 10.
After the athlete achieves that level, increase the distance to
50 meters. Before you know it, she will be able to perform 10
or even 20 repetitions at 100 meters.

By  manipulating  distance,  speed,  repetition,  and  rest  (the
four  interval  training  variables),  you  can  train  a  body  for
speed or endurance. Swimming longer distances at a slower
pace  develops  more  endurance,  while  swimming  faster
better  develops  speed.  Remember,  change  one  factor  such
as speed, and you usually have to change other factors such
as repetitions.

Interval Training for Running
Intervals range in distance from 15 to 50 meters for a football
player or tennis player to several miles for a distance runner
or race walker. Keep the desired outcome in mind. If the goal
is to develop peak speed and power, keep the distance of the
intervals relatively short. On the other hand, if you hope to
develop  endurance  for  sustained  efforts,  then  increase  the
interval distance.

A  good  beginning  interval  training  program  is  to  run
straight-aways  at  approximately  80  percent  of  maximum
speed  and  walk  the  turns  on  a  standard  400  meter  track.
Start  off  by  doing  two  laps  (800  meters)  by  running  the
straight-aways and walking the turns. Build up gradually to
8  laps  (16  straight-aways).  As  fitness  improves,  sprint  the
straight-aways at full speed. Later, sprint the straight-aways
and jog the turns.

Graduate to 200-meter intervals as fitness improves. Begin
by running two 200-meter intervals and progress to 8 to 10
repetitions. Following each 200-meter interval, walk across
the track infield to the starting position. Track races are run
counterclockwise. In the 200 meters, put more stress on the
inside  leg  (leg  closest  to  the  rail  of  the  track).  If  you  run
many 200-meter intervals, run some clockwise and others
counterclockwise so that you stress your legs equally.

Finally,  progress  to  400-meter  intervals.  These  can  be
extremely  exhausting,  particularly  when  run  at  high
intensities.  Again,  start  by  running  1  to  2  400-meter
intervals. Build up until the athlete successfully completes
6 to 8 of these. Each of the intervals should be completed in
approximately the same time.

There  are  countless  other  variations  of  interval  training.
Athletes can run intervals up stairs in the football or soccer
stadium,  up  hills,  and  down  hills.  Tennis  players  can  do
intervals running side-ways. Defensive backs in football can

International Sports Sciences Association128  |  unit 9

Interval Training for Cycling
Children  can  practice  cycling  intervals  almost  anywhere.
With accurate odometers and heart rate monitors available
for  cyclists,  a  rider  can  pace  interval  training  by  time,  by
distance, or by heart rate.

With time intervals, increase the riding pace (for example,
from  75  to  90  percent  of  maximum  capacity)  for  a  set
amount  of  time.  Suppose  the  athletes  take  a  20-mile  ride
and  want  to  perform  intervals  along  the  way. They  would
ride for one minute at 95 to 100 percent of maximum, coast
or ride easy for one minute, and repeat this sequence 5 to
10 times.

Intervals also can be done at a set distance. Go to a cycling
track  or  park  and  ride  intervals  at  a  set  distance.  Typical
interval distances might be 1 to 2 miles. Ride the distance
at a predetermined percentage of maximum, then ride easy
during the rest interval.

As in running, going up hills requires specific adaptation—
to succeed at riding up hills, you have to train on hills. An
example of an interval training program on hills would be
to ride up a hill, then coast back to the bottom. Repeat this
sequence 5 to 20 times depending on the size of the hill.

Interval Training for Other Activities

Interval training can be practiced in almost every sport and
exercise. In tennis, athletes could hit against a wall or tennis
ball machine for two minutes, rest one minute, then repeat.
On the stair-climbing machine, an athlete could exercise for
two minutes at a fast pace, rest one minute, and then repeat
the sequence. In basketball, athletes could run four court-
lengths, shooting a lay-up at each end, rest, and then repeat.
Implementing interval training programs is limited only by
imagination and creativity. The basic underlying principles
of interval training remain the same regardless of the sport.

SuMMARY

Training designed to improve the cardiovascular system and metabolism and to enhance muscle power develops
endurance. Endurance is highly specific: building endurance in one endurance activity will not result in a full transfer
of that increased endurance to another activity. Primary training methods for developing endurance include over-
distance and interval training. The key is to build up gradually with either method.

Flexibility—the ability to move a joint through its range of motion (ROM)—is a key
fitness  component  for  health  and  performance.  The  topic  of  flexibility  is  perhaps  the
least studied and most misunderstood area of fitness. Children initially have excellent
flexibility, but they lose it quickly as they become more physically inactive or play sports
that do not work the muscles through their full ROM.

Good flexibility is important for normal joint function and injury prevention. The goal
should be to attain normal flexibility in the major joints. Extreme flexibility causes joint
instability,  which  can  lead  to  pain  in  the  back,  hips,  shoulders,  and  knees.  Balanced
flexibility  (not  too  much  or  too  little)  provides  essential  joint  stability  and  facilitates
smooth, economical movement patterns. Flexible hip and thigh muscles help to maintain
proper spinal alignment that reduces the chances of back pain. Flexible knees, shoulders,
and ankles help to prevent stresses and injuries to their supporting muscle groups and soft
tissues. Optimal flexibility helps to maintain pain-free joint movement with aging. Some
evidence even suggests that increased strength through resistance exercise may become
impaired with inadequate flexibility. Smooth performance of many movements in sports
and daily living is nearly impossible with less than normal flexibility. It makes sense to
help children develop good flexibility from the beginning. Once lost, re-establishing the
prior level of flexibility requires considerable effort and discipline.

Joint flexibility is a highly adaptable physical fitness quality specific to each joint. Good
flexibility  in  one  joint  does  not  necessarily  mean  good  flexibility  in  another  joint.  A
joint moved regularly through its ROM will tend to have good flexibility. For example,
gymnasts generally have extremely good spinal flexibility, while tennis players tend to
have excellent flexibility in the shoulder. These athletes stress the affected joints to the
limits of their movement capacities, so they require excellent flexibility in those joints.
The main determining factor for flexibility seems to be the extent to which each joint can
be stressed to the limits of its ROM.

People  lose  flexibility  when  they  do  not  exercise  much  or  move  their  joints  regularly
through  normal  ranges  of  motion.  Unfit  people  tend  to  be  much  less  flexible  than  fit
people—so much so that joint stiffness interferes with movements important in everyday
life. For example, rising from a chair or reaching overhead for objects stored in a cabinet
are  more  difficult  without  good  flexibility.  Deteriorating  flexibility  eventually  impairs
normal joint function and creates a handicapping condition. Performing exercises that

contribute to flexibility (i.e., exercises that work the joints through their normal ROM or
specific stretching exercises) is important for general fitness and wellness.

Children  need  a  balance  between  flexibility  and  stability.  In  the  spine,  for  example,
extreme flexibility can lead to back pain, while spinal stiffness can decrease the risk of
injury to the back, neck, and extremities.

WhAT DETERMINES FLExIbILITY?
The ability to move a joint is limited either by (1) tissues that prevent movement (the
tissues either get in the way of movement or provide resistance to further movement),
and  (2) muscle length established by the nervous  system. While  some factors  such as
bone  structure  cannot  change,  other  factors—such  as  the  resting  length  of  elastic  soft
tissues—can be altered through exercise.

TISSueS ThaT obSTrucT range oF moTIon
The bones of the skeleton limit movement in many joints—the structure of the bones
forming many joints allows joint movement to proceed only so far. These “bony stops”
help  give  strength  and  stability  to  joints  and  are  of  obvious  importance  in  human
movement. Joint capsules surround the body’s major joints. These semi-elastic structures
also limit movement. While they can be stretched slightly, they are semi-rigid and resist
deformation. Joint capsules also contribute strength and stability to joints.

The body contains many soft tissues that limit flexibility. Fat, skin, and large muscles can
“get in the way” and prevent a joint from moving through a larger ROM. For example,
people with extremely large biceps muscles cannot fully flex (bend) their elbows because
the large upper arm muscles interfere with movement. Most children do not have this
problem, but it can apply to high school-aged bodybuilders. Obese people are prevented
from making certain movements, such as flexing the trunk completely, because excess
body fat impedes the ROM in this region. Obesity with accompanying excess body fat
is a problem in young people because it can decrease flexibility. Tight skin, stretched by
large muscles, body fat, or pregnancy, also interferes with movements.

muScle elaSTIcITY
Muscle tissue is the key to developing flexibility. In addition to the contractile proteins
within muscles that create movement, muscle contains collagenous tissues that provide
structure,  elasticity,  and  bulk  to  the  muscle. The  two  principle  collagenous  tissues  are
collagen, white fibers that provide structure and support, and elastin, yellow, elastic
and flexible fibers. The elastin fibers have the capacity to stretch and rapidly snap back
to their resting position when stretch is relieved. If the fibers are loaded at low levels of
stress, as during exercises that gently stress the joints to the limits of their ROM, then the
elastic fibers become longer—in other words, they stretch.

Of course, there is a limit to the amount of stretch a muscle will tolerate. If stretched
too much, the collagen does not return to its resting shape, and injury results. Collagen
increases in stiffness with stretching. When reaching the limits of its flexibility, the collagen
becomes more brittle and may rupture if over stretched. The stretch characteristics of
elastic tissue in muscle are important considerations in a stretching program. One must
stretch the muscles enough to lengthen the elastic tissue, but over–stretching a muscle
may cause a serious injury. The effective and safe stretching program is one that stresses
the  muscle  enough  to  slightly  elongate  and  stretch  the  elastic  fibers,  but  allows  them
return to their normal shape without injury.

conTrol oF muScle lengTh
The  nervous  system  controls  muscle  length  through  feedback  from  nerve  structures
called proprioceptors; these include stretch receptors, golgi tendon organs (GTOs),
and  pacinian  corpuscles.  Proprioceptors  help  the  nervous  system  regulate  muscle
length and flexibility, and help to control the speed, strength, and coordination of muscle
contractions.  They  detect  even  small  changes  in  position  or  force  in  the  muscles  and
joints.  The  stretch  receptors,  which  lie  parallel  with  the  contractile  tissue  in  muscle,
detect changes in muscle length. The GTOs, located within tendons, detect increases in
muscle force. The pacinian corpuscles, which lie close to the GTOs, detect movement
and pressure changes in the muscles and joints.

Stretch receptors help to maintain muscle tone and protect the joints and muscles from
injury. Sudden changes in length cause a stronger stretch reflex. The stretch receptors
monitor muscle length and the rate of any change in length. A rapid change in muscle
length causes a stretch reflex. The stretch receptor then sends a signal to the spinal cord,
triggering  a  muscle  contraction  that  resists  the  change  in  muscle  length.  Ballistic  or

bounce  stretching  can  be  dangerous  because  of  increased  risk  of  injury:  each  bounce
stretch  causes  a  reflex  contraction,  so  you  could  easily  stretch  the  muscle  while  it  is
contracting. It is easier and safer to stretch a muscle when it is not trying to contract. A
muscle overload technique used by power athletes called plyometrics takes advantage of
the stretch reflex to increase muscle strength and power.

The GTOs protect muscle from too much tension. They send signals to the spinal cord
about muscle tension and the rate of change of the tension. Excessive tension inhibits
muscle contraction and promotes relaxation and lengthening of the muscles and their
antagonists  (a  process  called  reciprocal  inhibition).  The  GTO  signals  that  promote
muscle  relaxation  are  stronger  than  signals  from  the  muscle  spindles  that  promote
muscle contraction.

Static  stretching (stretching and holding a position for 15 to 30 seconds) helps the
proprioceptors habituate or get used to a longer length. Combining stretching with muscle

contractions—a  technique  called  proprioceptive  neuromuscular  facilitation  or
PNF—is  a  particularly  effective  technique  for  increasing  flexibility  because  it  inhibits
the  stretch  receptors  and  encourages  the  GTO  signals  for  greater  muscle  relaxation.
For  example,  vigorously  contracting  the  quadriceps  muscles  causes  relaxation  of  the
hamstrings,  making  it  easier  to  stretch  them.  Stretching  regularly  trains  all  of  the
proprioceptors to allow greater muscle lengthening.

(PNF): Training technique
that uses muscle and neural
reflexes to augment the training
stimulus.

Modifying  nervous  control  through  movement  and  specific  exercises  is  the  optimal
way to improve functional ROM. You must work on this every day (or several times a
day) because the length and tension sensors adapt quickly. For example, the multifidus
muscles of the spine are critical for controlling spinal stability. Proprioceptors associated
with these muscles signal the nervous system to restrict spinal motion when you sit for
several hours studying or watching TV. You may experience back pain if you sit regularly
without allowing the muscles in the thorax (“the core”) to exercise through their normal
range of motion.

TYPES OF STRETChINg TEChNIQuES
Stretching  techniques  vary  from  simply  stretching  the  muscles  during  the  course  of
normal activities to sophisticated techniques that stretch the muscles with muscle reflexes
to obtain more stretch during the exercise. Clearly, improper stretching techniques can
do more harm than good.

STaTIc STreTchIng
In static stretching, you stretch the muscle slowly and gradually and hold the stretch for 15
to 30 seconds, rest for 30 to 60 seconds, and repeat, trying to increase the ROM. Because
the  stretch  occurs  slowly,  much  less  reaction  occurs  from  the  stretch  receptors.  The
process involves stretching the muscles and joints to the point where one feels a pull but
not to the point of pain. One must never stretch so pain occurs because over–stretching
the muscle can lead to injury. Static stretching is the type most often recommended by
fitness experts because it is as effective and safer than other types of stretching exercises.

ballISTIc STreTchIng
ballistic  stretching  involves  a  dynamic  muscle  action  where  the  muscles  stretch
suddenly in a bouncing action. For example, a ballistic stretch for the hamstrings might
involve  touching  your  toes  repeatedly  in  rapid  succession.  Ballistic  stretching  trains
the  elastic  component  of  muscle (mainly composed of connective tissue that acts
much like a rubber band to increase elasticity in muscle), so it may be an appropriate
training method for some well-trained athletes. For example, tennis players stretch their
hamstrings and quadriceps ballistically when they lunge for a ball and might benefit from
ballistic  stretching.  The  problem  with  this  stretching  technique  is  that  rapid  stretches
evoke a powerful stretch receptor response that can trigger an injury. Further, after doing
these exercises, the stretch receptors remain overactive. This may lead to injury during an
activity such as running or tennis.

PaSSIve STreTchIng
In passive stretching, a partner assists in moving joints through their ROM. One can
achieve a greater ROM passively than statically. However, because you are not controlling
the movement, there is a greater risk of injury. Passive stretching is a valuable technique
but should only be used by experienced people who thoroughly understand this method.
There must also be good communication between those performing and receiving passive
stretches.

FuncTIonal STreTchIng
Functional stretching involves dynamic stretching through the ROM used in specific
sports or movements of daily life. Do functional stretches slowly to lengthen the muscles
without  developing  high  tension  in  the  tissue,  and  do  them  in  many  directions  to
maximally remodel the tissues and train the neuromuscular system. Many people who
play tennis, golf, or volleyball but don’t stretch regularly have good flexibility because
they move through full ranges of motion during the activity. One can combine functional
stretching  and  functional  strength  exercises.  For  example,  lunge  curls  stretch  the  hip,
thigh, and calf muscles and stabilize the core muscles, while at the same time building
arm strength. Many activities build functional flexibility and strength at the same time,
including yoga, Pilates, Tai Chi, Olympic weight lifting, plyometrics, Swiss and bosu ball
training, medicine ball exercises, and functional training machines (Life Fitness, Cybex).

PNF techniques improve strength and flexibility. These techniques use reflexes initiated
by  muscle  and  joint  receptors  to  produce  greater  training  effects.  The  most  popular
PNF stretching technique is the contract-relax stretching method—the muscle actively
contracts before it is stretched. As discussed, contracting the muscle first causes it to relax
more so that it can be stretched more effectively. The technique is controversial. There is
no evidence to show that this procedure is any more effective than static stretching.

bENEFITS OF FLExIbILITY AND
STRETChINg ExERCISES
Flexibility  has  wide–ranging  benefits  for  wellness  and  sports  performance.  Good
flexibility  may  help  prevent  injury,  enhance  joint  function,  and  make  movements  in
many sports skills easier and more efficient.

FlexIbIlITY and InjurY
Muscles  are  injured  when  they  are  loaded  more  than  they  can  tolerate.  Muscles  can
stretch, but only to a point. Stretching muscles too far can lead to injury. The flexible joint
can move further in the ROM before reaching critical stresses that cause injury.

Until recently, most experts recommended stretching before exercise. However, several
recent  studies  have  found  that  pre-exercise  stretching  decreases  muscle  strength  and
power and might increase the risk of injury. Exercising with sensitive stretch receptors
may  increase  the  chance  that  the  muscle  contracts  while  in  a  stretched  position,  a
scenario that may end in injury. Static stretching after the workout, when the muscles are
“warmed-up”, increases joint ROM without increasing stretch receptor sensitivity.

Many  coaches  are  including  functional  stretching  before  workouts  or  competition  to
avoid disrupting the function of muscle and joint proprioceptors. We need more research
before we can recommend this technique.

International Sports Sciences Association136  |  unit 10

FlexIbIlITY and
joInT healTh
Researchers  believe  that  good  joint  health  requires  good
flexibility.  Joints  supported  by  inflexible  muscles  and  soft
tissues  are  subjected  to  abnormal  stresses  that  can  lead  to
joint  deterioration.  In  the  knee  joint,  for  example,  tight
quadriceps and hamstrings cause excessive pressure on the
kneecap  that  can  precipitate  pain  in  the  knee  joint.  Tight
shoulder muscles can compress sensitive soft tissues in the
shoulder that triggers pain and disability in the joint. Poor
joint  flexibility  can  also  produce  abnormalities  in  joint
lubrication that leads to further deterioration in the sensitive
cartilage cells that line the joint (i.e., chondrocytes).

joInT FlexIbIlITY
and SPInal alIgnmenT
Back  pain  affects  nearly  85  percent  of  the  population  at
some time in their lives. Back pain may be related to poor
spinal alignment, which puts pressure on the nerves leaving
the  spinal  column.  Poor  flexibility  in  the  muscles  around
the  hip  and  knees  and  poor  spinal  stability  can  increase
the  curve  of  the  lower  spine  and  cause  the  pelvis  to  tilt
forward excessively. Good fitness in these body areas, along
with good posture, helps to prevent abnormal pressures on
sensitive spinal nerves.

Flexibility and Body
Position in Sports
Good  flexibility  lets  you  move  and  thus  exert  more  force
through a greater ROM. Flexible people are able to assume
body  positions  that  allow  them  to  move  more  efficiently.
As examples, skiers with flexible hips and spines are better
able to get over the edge of their skis to make better turns.
Swimmers  with  more  flexible  shoulders  have  a  stronger
stroke because they can pull through the water in a direction
closer to the body’s mid-line. Hikers with flexible calves and
Achilles tendons are better able to climb steep hills without
pain because of their greater ROM in the lower leg.

FlexIbIlITY and STrengTh
Many  people  think  that  weight  lifting  creates  muscle-
boundness. A look at many weight lifters seems to reinforce
this impression—many have large, bulky muscles, and their
skin  has  stretch  marks  from  trying  to  accommodate  the
tremendous bulk. However, it has always been apparent that

strong  people  also  can  be  flexible.  In  the  1950s,  Olympic
weight lifter and renowned body builder John Grimek was
famous for his displays of flexibility in addition to his great
feats  of  strength.  Many  top  strength  athletes  of  today  are
also flexible because they work at it in a systematic way and
on a regular basis.

Researchers have discovered a link between flexibility and
strength.  A  minimum  amount  of  flexibility  is  important
to  gain  strength  normally.  With  extremely  poor  flexibility,
strength is not gained as fast compared to individuals with
normal flexibility. Research has shown that lack of flexibility
in  antagonistic  muscle  groups  impedes  muscle  strength
development  and  hypertrophy  (e.g.,  increase  in  muscle
size). An antagonistic muscle opposes the action of another
muscle (i.e., hamstring muscles are the antagonistic muscle
group to the quadriceps).

Lack  of  hamstrings  flexibility  affects  quadriceps  strength
because of the principle of reciprocal inhibition. Reciprocal
inhibition  stimulates  muscle  spindles  of  the  antagonist
muscle  (e.g.,  the  hamstrings)  to  inhibit  excitation  of  the
agonist  muscle  (e.g.,  the  quadriceps)  through  a  neural
process that involves the spinal cord. The muscle spindles
are  receptors  within  the  muscles  sensitive  to  stretch.  In  a
squat, for example, if the muscle spindles in the hamstrings
are  stimulated  during  the  pushing  phase  of  the  lift,  this
inhibits  the  quadriceps.  This  action  prevents  exerting  full
force during the squat and constrains the  individual from
increasing strength in this lift.

Many  studies  have  examined  the  influence  of  reciprocal
inhibition  in  limb  movement.  In  the  knee  jerk  reflex,  for
example,  tapping  the  patellar  tendon  produces  a  stretch
reflex  by  the  muscle  spindles  in  the  quadriceps  muscles,
making them contract while inhibiting the hamstrings and
knee extension.

According to this principle, inflexible hamstring muscles may
make it more difficult to strengthen knee extensors. During
knee  extension,  premature  stimulation  of  the  hamstring
muscle  spindles  could  reflexly  inhibit  the  quadriceps.
Research shows that quadriceps strength tends to be less in
people  with  less  flexible  hamstrings. This  probably  occurs
because  the  muscle  spindles  in  the  hamstrings  “turn  off ”
the  quadriceps  during  the  final  phase  of  most  lower  body
exercises. Chronic quadriceps inhibition keeps individuals
from becoming as strong as they would if they had normal
hamstring flexibility.

A  minimum  amount  of  flexibility  in  major  muscles  seems
necessary  to  avoid  impairing  antagonistic  muscle  strength.
For  example,  when  hamstring  flexibility  is  less  than  the
flexibility threshold, a significant portion of its muscle spindle

Youth FitnessFlexibility  |  137

may  be  prematurely  stimulated  during  knee  extension.
This  may  produce  a  premature  stretch  reflex  response  in
hamstrings and reflex inhibition in knee extensors.

Do  these  findings  mean  that  young  athletes  should  spend
four to five hours a week stretching? The answer is simply
“No.” Poor flexibility will only impair strength if the athlete
is extremely tight. Research does not suggest that improved
flexibility will improve strength at a more rapid rate. It shows
that inflexibility slows progress in strength training programs.
In an extremely inflexible person, working on flexibility may
make it easier to gain strength. Presently, the examination of
strength and flexibility has been limited to the relationship
between  hamstring  flexibility  and  quadriceps  strength.
However, there is no reason to believe that muscle spindles
work differently in areas other than the legs.

Several studies suggest that stretching before exercise might
decrease performance in maximum power exercises such as
jumping and throwing. As discussed previously, stretching

stimulates  the  GTOs,  which  act  to  limit  muscle  tension.
When you stretch, try to exert maximum power or strength
to  avoid  GTO  stimulation  that  can  hamper  performance.
It  is  better  to  warm-up  by  doing  low  intensity  dynamic
exercises. The ritual of stretching before exercise may lead to
injury and decreased performance. Pre-exercise stretching
will remain controversial for many years to come.

# Principles Of
FLExIbILITY
Ideally,  do  stretching  exercises  after  the  normal  workout.
Stretching  before  exercise  should  consist  of  functional
movements  similar  to  those  used  in  the  sport.  Do  static
stretching after training or competition. The muscles will be
“warmer” and less at risk of injury.

Table  10.1  includes  the  eight  principles  that  should  be
followed as part of the young athlete’s stretching program.

Table 10.1

Eight Principles of Flexibility

1.  Stretch statically. Stretch and hold the position for 15 to 30 seconds, rest 30 to 60 seconds, and
repeat the sequence. Do not “bounce” while stretching because it can increase the risk of injury.

2.  Practice stretching exercises regularly and develop flexibility gradually over time. Improved flexibility,

like other components of fitness, takes many months to develop.

3.  Do static stretching exercises following the workout when the muscles are warm and the neural changes

induced by stretching cannot impair performance or increase injury risk.

4.  When performing these exercises, strive for a mild stretch rather than pain. Emphasize relaxation.

The stretching program should not cause significant post-exercise soreness. If it does, then the stretching
routine was too severe.

5.  Relax and breathe easily during stretching. Try to relax the muscles being stretched.

6.  Perform all flexibility exercises on both sides of the body.

7.  Avoid positions that increase the risk of low back injury. For example, when performing straight leg

toe-touching exercises, bend the knees slightly when returning to a standing position.

8.  Understand that substantial individual differences exist in joint flexibility.

Avoid competition during stretching workouts.

Supine Alternate Hamstring Stretch
This  is  an  excellent  exercise  for  stretching  the  back,
hamstrings, hips, knees, ankles, and buttocks.

Directions: Lie on your back with both legs straight. Grasp
the  back  of  your  right  thigh  and  bring  your  knee  to  your
chest  (this  segment  is  sometimes  called  the  knee-to-chest
exercise).  Pull  on  your  thigh  until  you  feel  a  stretch  in
your low back. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. Then,
extend your knee so you feel a stretch in the back of your

Modified Hurdler Stretch

This exercise stretches the hamstring muscles and lower
back. Avoid doing hurdler stretches where you sit with
one leg stretched out to the side as you stretch the other
extended leg. Turning out the bent leg can put excessive

Standing Calf Stretch
Flexible calf muscles help prevent knee, ankle, and foot pain.
This  exercise  helps  to  stretch  calf  muscles  (gastrocnemius
and soleus) and the Achilles tendon.

Directions: This is a two-part exercise. Stand with one foot
about one to two feet in front of the other, with both feet
pointing forward. (a) Keeping your back leg straight, lunge
forward by bending your front knee and pushing your rear
heel  backward.  Hold  the  stretch  for  15  to  30  seconds.  (b)
Then,  pull  your  back  foot  in  slightly,  and  bend  your  back
knee. Shift your weight to your back leg and hold the stretch.
Repeat this exercise on the other side.

Groin Stretch
The groin muscles attach to the inside portion of your pelvis
and are extremely important for lateral movements. These
muscles  are  often  injured  in  strength-speed  sports  that
require  sprinting  and  quick  directional  change  (examples
include  tennis,  basketball,  soccer,  racquetball,  volleyball,
and field hockey).

Directions: Stand in a wide straddle with the legs turned
out from the hip joints and hands on the thighs. Go to one
side by bending one knee and keeping the other leg straight.
Feel a stretch in the muscles on the inside of the thigh of the
extended leg. Repeat on the other side.

SuMMARY

Children initially have excellent flexibility, but they lose it quickly if they are physi-
cally inactive or play sports that do not work the muscles through full ranges of
motion. The goal should be to attain normal flexibility in the major joints. Bal-
anced flexibility (not too much or too little) provides joint stability and facilitates
smooth, economical movement patterns. The effective and safe stretching pro-
gram is one that stresses the muscle enough to slightly elongate and stretch the
elastic fibers without causing injury. The nervous system controls muscle length
through feedback from nerve structures called proprioceptors. These include
stretch receptors, Golgi tendon organs, and pacinian corpuscles. Five types of
stretching include static, ballistic, passive, functional, and PNF. Flexibility has wide–
ranging benefits for wellness and sports performance.

Major stretching principles include the following:

1.  Most children should stretch statically, holding the stretch for 15 to 30

seconds, resting for 30 to 60 seconds, and then repeating the stretch.

2.  Stretching should be done following exercise rather than before. Athletes
may practice functional ROM exercises before practice or competition,
but they should avoid static stretching until after exercise.

3.

For preventing back pain, children should stretch the muscles around
the knees and hips and develop endurance in the muscles that support
the spine.

Children make substantial gains in strength, power, and muscle mass from lifting weights
and performing resistance exercises using body weight. More importantly, kids can do
these exercises safely and without damaging fragile bone growth centers. Weight training
is particularly good for girls because it helps to build bone mass and to strengthen bones,
muscles, and tendons. It also helps prevent future fractures during adulthood when bone
mass typically declines with age.

Not all gyms welcome children. Locate a health and fitness club that promotes weight
training  instruction,  especially  for  kids.  Keep  it  fun  and  build  strength  gradually  and
consistently.  Muscle  strength  is  an  important  fitness  component  for  everyone.  People
interested in fitness for health need to build adequate strength levels to maintain healthy
joints, strong bones, and metabolically active muscle tissue. Those interested in building
attractive,  healthy-looking  bodies  develop  strength  so  they  can  have  lean,  shapely
muscles. Young athletes need strength to make their movements forceful and powerful.

Increasing strength is quite simple—make the muscles work intensely against increased
resistance. Resistance includes body weight, barbells and dumbbells, kettlebells, stones,
medicine  balls,  sledgehammers,  cables,  elastic  bands,  backpacks,  farmer’s  bars,  and
weight machines. Children can build strength in home gyms, health clubs, school weight
training classes, or with personal trainers who bring their equipment to the client’s home.
A personal trainer and coach can control how quickly athletes gain strength.

DEvELOPINg bASIC MOvEMENT
SKILLS FOR STRENgTh TRAININg
Building strength and power is important for young athletes as well as for youngsters
who are not athletes. Children should develop good whole body movement skills from
the  beginning.  A  foundational  principle  is  that  children  should  train  movements,  not
muscles.  Powerful  movements  usually  begin  in  the  lower  body  using  hip  and  thigh
muscles. Children should maintain a stiff, neutral spine during most movements so that
the muscles in the torso (core muscles) act as a spring for transferring force from the
lower body to the upper body. They should learn to hinge at the hips rather than in the
spine when performing squats, lifting from the floor, and performing rotational exercises
(e.g., hitting a golf ball or baseball, throwing a discus or javelin, or serving a volleyball).

Figure 1.1 Seated Hip HInge with Proper Form.

ProPer hIP hInge movemenTS
Many experienced high school and college athletes actually fail to use the hip hinge when
doing squats and platform lifts. They often bend their spines, overuse their quads, and
fail to activate the gluteal and hamstring muscles. Children should develop basic lower
body movement skills before being allowed to perform squats, step-ups, cleans, snatches,
or deadlifts. These skills will help kids develop lower body power and a stable spine that
will promote musculoskeletal health for a lifetime.

aSSeSSIng and develoPIng movemenT
SKIllS For loaded lower bodY exercISeS
Most children do squats improperly, which increases the risk of knee and back pain. Poor
lower body movement skills impair the ability to learn other lifts, such as deadlifts, cleans,
and snatches. Each functional test is progressively more difficult, so the child should not
progress to the next test until they have scored at least a 3 on the current test. After giving
the young athletes instruction, rate their ability to perform the following movements that
begin on the following page (you can give partial credit with scores of 4 or 2).

Chair Squats
Instructions: Sit up straight in a chair with the back resting
against  the  backrest  and  the  arms  at  the  sides.  The  feet
should be placed more than shoulder width apart. Begin the
motion of rising out of the chair by flexing at the hips and
not at the back. Then, squat up using a hip hinge movement
(no  spine  movement).  Stand  without  rocking  forward,
bending  the  back,  or  using  external  support  and  keep  the

head  in  a  neutral  position.  Return  to  the  sitting  position
(i.e., sit) while maintaining a flat back (neutral spine) and
keeping  the  weight  placed  over  the  center  of  the  feet. The
thighs should abduct (spread) when sitting back in the chair.
Use the hip extensor muscles as much as possible to stand
and the hip flexors to sit. Do five repetitions of this exercise.

used

On the surface, kettlebells do not look much different than
standard  dumbbells.  They  have  a  handle  connected  to  a
weight  just  like  dumbbells,  and  they  come  in  a  variety  of
sizes.  But  that’s  where  the  similarity  ends.  The  kettlebell
weight  is  located  at  the  end  of  the  handle  instead  of  on
either  side  of  it.  Also,  the  design  of  the  kettlebell  allows
performance  of  high-speed  ballistic  exercises  with  a
pendulum–like  action.  Many  kettlebell  exercises  such  as
swings,  snatches,  and  cleans,  require  high-speed  eccentric
muscle contractions that produce surprisingly high muscle
forces. High-speed kettlebell training develops whole-body
fitness rapidly, with little or no muscle soreness.

Kettlebell training is not the end-all substitute for traditional
resistive  exercise.  However,  almost  any  exercise  that  can
be  done  with  free  weights  and  machines  can  be  done
with  kettlebells.  They  are  terrific  training  tools  that  build
strength,  power,  muscle  endurance,  and  aerobic  capacity,
and they promote fat loss. They also offer a training stimulus
(i.e., high speed ballistic and eccentric training) not offered
by other modes of exercise.

Most modern health clubs contain lots of expensive exercise

equipment  designed  to  isolate  specific  muscle  groups  in
the arms, shoulders, thighs, and abdomen. While isolation
training is important in bodybuilding, it does not develop
the  functional  fitness  that  is  important  for  young  athletes
and  that  they  can  use  in  sports  or  activities  of  daily  life.
Most kettlebell exercises work the body in a dynamic way
that links and coordinates large muscle contractions while
promoting smooth, powerful movements.

Choose the Appropriate Weight
Young children (5 to 10 years old) should begin with a light,
5-pound  kettlebell  and  build  up  gradually.  Older  children
can  use  heavier  weights—from  about  12  to  as  much  as
53  pounds,  depending  on
gender  and  strength
levels.
Emphasize
technique  over
weight.  Kettlebells  are  a  fun
and  enjoyable  way  for  kids  to
build  strength,  power,  muscle
endurance, spinal stabilization,
and  aerobic  capacity  (if  they
do enough reps).

Basic Kettlebell Exercises
There  are  countless  varieties  of  kettlebell  exercises,  with
the one- and two-arm swing and the one-arm snatch being
central  to  learning  the  hip  hinge  and  the  elastic  spine
concept critical for young athletes.

The Kettlebell Swing
(Two- and One-Arm Swings)
The  kettlebell  swing  is  the  principle  exercise  in  kettlebell
training routines. The exercise appears simple, but requires
coordinated,  linked  contractions  of  the  thigh,  buttocks,
core, and upper body muscles to do it properly. Stand a foot
or  so  behind  the  kettlebell,  sit  back,  and  grasp  the  handle
with both hands. With the weight on your heels, swing the
kettlebell backwards so that it pendulates (rocks back and
forth)  fairly  close  to  your  groin.  Drive  the  hips  forward
and contract the quads, glutes, pelvic floor, and abdominal
muscles, which causes a rapid acceleration of the kettlebell
upwards  to  shoulder  level.  Exhale  sharply  (but  not  fully)
at  the  top  of  the  swing  to  accentuate  the  bracing  motions
of the major muscles in the body. Keeping the spine in an
upright neutral position (i.e., maintaining the natural spinal

Youth Fitnesscurves),  let  the  kettlebell  accelerate  downward  as  you  flex
your  hips,  bend  at  the  knees,  and  maintain  straight  arms.
Perform 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise. As your skill
increases, do the swings one arm at a time.

uninterrupted  motion  to  a  straight-arm  lockout,  with  the
biceps muscle close to the head. During the upward swing,
used  the  bracing  movement  created  by  simultaneously
contracting  the  quads,  glutes,  pelvic  floor,  and  abdominal
muscles to propel the kettlebell upward. Stop momentarily
with  the  arms  and  legs  straight  and  the  feet  and  body
stationery.  Lower  the  kettlebell  between  the  legs  with  one
loose, uninterrupted motion without touching the chest or
the shoulder and repeat the motion again. Do this exercise
with the right arm and then the left arm. More experienced
young  athletes  can  do  high  repetition  routines  that  build
high levels of fitness quickly.

One-Arm Kettlebell Snatch

TranSITIonIng InTo
whole bodY lIFTS
As  discussed,  young  athletes  should  develop  proper  body
mechanics  using  kettlebells,  chair-sits,  step-ups,  and
unloaded double and single leg squats. Gradually, they can
add  resistance  by  holding  dumbbells  or  kettlebells  during
these  movements.  They  should  not  begin  loaded  back  or
front  squats  or  pulling  exercises  from  the  floor  until  they
develop  good  technique  in  basic  movement  skills,  build
strong  thigh  and  buttock  muscles,  and  have  the  strength
and flexibility to maintain a neutral spine when performing
unloaded movements.

Children  also  benefit  from  more  traditional  strength
training  methods.  Almost  any  resistive  exercise  works,  as
long as the young athlete uses proper technique.

Two-Arm Kettlebell Swing

One-Arm Kettlebell Snatch
As young athletes hone their two-arm and one-arm swing
skills,  they  can  graduate  to  the  one-armed  snatch.  The
snatch  involves  raising  the  kettlebell  overhead  in  one

Some exercises, such as sit-ups, are not recommended because they put excessive stress on
the spinal disks. Children will probably not experience immediate spinal disk problems
from inappropriate sit-ups on a slant board or back hyperextensions, but these exercises
can cause gradual spinal deterioration that might require back surgery when the person
reaches 30 or 40 years of age. A guiding principle for weight training or sports training
is that “good technique does not hurt.” Fatigue is a natural part of sports training but
pain—particularly if it persists after exercise—indicates a training error.

reSISTance exercISe meThodS
There are four ways to perform resistance exercise: isometric (force against immovable
objects),  free  weights  (dumbbells,  barbells,  kettlebells),  weight  machines,  and
calisthenics  (exercises  that  use  body  weight  as  the  resistance).  Children  can  do
isometrics and calisthenics almost anywhere. They are a good way to develop strength in
young clients without having to invest in equipment. However, they are less effective than
free weights and weight machines for gaining strength.

Isometrics
Isometrics became popular shortly after World War II. Since then, considerable research
has provided useful information on this form of strengthening exercise and training. One
of the important findings is that strength increases only in the joint positions worked
during  the  exercise.  There  are  several  effective  isometric  exercises  for  abdominal  and
neck muscles that are easily added to a program. Several examples of simple, effective
isometric exercises are described in this section.

Free Weights
Most serious strength trainers prefer free weights because they are inexpensive, readily
available, and are easily adaptable to almost any movement or muscle action. Whole body
dynamic exercises, such as the clean and snatch, are impossible using weight machines.
These advanced exercises, described in the plyometrics and jumping unit (Unit 12) of
the course, are popular with serious power athletes.

Free weights include barbells and dumbbells. Standard barbells come in a variety of sizes,
with the bar weighing 15 to 30 pounds. Weight plates for these barbells usually range in
weight from 1-1/4 pounds to 25 pounds. Dumbbells are adjustable or fixed weight. Fixed
dumbbells, usually found in gyms and health clubs, range in weight from 1 pound to 150
pounds or more.

Youth FitnessMuscle Strength  |  153

Most  serious  weight  trainers  use  Olympic  barbells.  These
are  typically  7  feet  long  and  weigh  20  kg  (44.1  pounds).
American  Olympic  bars  weigh  45  pounds.  The  bars  are
better  balanced  than  standard  barbells  and  are  designed
to  hold  more  weight.  Typical  weight-plate  configurations
range  from  2  to  25  kilograms.  However,  smaller  weights
also  are  available  for  weight  lifting  contests.  Athletes  who
do dynamic lifts—such as the clean, snatch, and jerk—use
rubber covered bumper plates that do not damage the floor
when dropped. Olympic bars are available in weights as low
as 15 pounds, which is a desirable weight for preadolescent
boys and for girls and women.

“high-tech” appeal and do not

expensive and usually only are
available  in  health  and  fitness

clubs.  Be  careful  about  weight  machines  designed  for  the
home. Inexpensive versions are typically poorly constructed
and  can  be  potentially  dangerous.  Also,  they  are  unlikely
to fit children, so let the child try the machine before you
purchase  one.  There  are  several  companies  that  market
weight machines just for kids.

Weight machines come in a variety of designs that can be
overwhelming to even an experienced weight trainer. Some
incorporate  variable  resistance  so  that  the  load  increases
progressively  throughout  the  exercise  range  of  motion.
Machines  provide  resistance  using  weight  stacks,  weight
plates, air, rubber bands, and hydraulic fluid. Some provide
resistance  during  the  active  phase  of  the  lift  (concentric),
while  others  also  provide  resistance  during  the  active  and
recovery (eccentric) phases of the exercise. Kids can increase
strength on almost any weight machine if they exercise on it
regularly and consistently.

Calisthenics
Calisthenics  are  resistive  exercises  using  body  weight  as
resistance. Children should learn to handle their own body
weight. Exercises such as pull-ups, step-ups, and push-ups
that  use  the  child’s  bodyweight  as  resistance  are  excellent
for beginners. They are also excellent for people who want
to develop muscle strength but are unwilling to join a fitness
club or devote too much time to the activity. Children who
are  serious  about  increasing  strength  should  join  a  gym
or  fitness  club.  These  facilities  typically  offer  equipment
beyond  the  scope  of  a  home  gym.  Gyms  also  provide  the
opportunity  for  young  athletes  to  mingle  with  advanced
older athletes. This is important because observing skilled
and more physically fit athletes can be a source of motivation.
Some gyms have exercise machines built especially for kids.

International Sports Sciences Association154  |  unit 11

chooSIng The exercISeS
Choose  exercises  that  develop  the  major  muscle  groups—
the shoulders, chest, upper back, arms, abdomen, low back,
thighs  and  gluteals,  and  calves.  This  section  of  the  course
suggests ten popular and well-known exercises.

Young  athletes  interested  in  high  power  sports  (e.g.,
football,  basketball,  most  track  and  field  events,  baseball
and softball, and soccer) should focus their program around
whole body exercises such as squats, lunges, step-ups, push-
presses,  cleans,  snatches,  kettlebell  swings,  bench  presses,
and deadlifts. Power athletes should build core strength and
avoid  doing  too  many  bodybuilding  exercises.  Likewise,
bodybuilders should concentrate on developing muscle size
and definition.

daYS Per weeK
Increase  strength  by  making  the  muscles  work  against
increased resistance. This stress is called overload. It is best
to overload specific muscle groups two to three days a week.
Most  people  choose  6  to  10  exercises  and  do  them  three
times a week. Bodybuilders train four days a week (called
a split routine), alternating between exercises for the upper
and  lower  body.  Split  routines  might  include  exercises  for
the  chest,  arms,  shoulders,  back,  and  abdominal  muscles
two  days  a  week  (for  example,  Monday  and  Thursday),
and  exercises  for  the  gluteal,  thigh,  and  calf  muscles  the
other two days (e.g., Tuesday and Friday). Split routines are
excessive for most young athletes.

Children  should  balance  hard  work  in  the  gym  with  rest.
Muscles increase strength and size following the workout.
Individuals cannot make significant gains without allowing
sufficient rest between workouts. Sometimes, rest is just as
important as hard work for improving fitness.

rePeTITIonS, SeTS, and reST
Weight  training  programs  are  subdivided  into  repetitions
and sets. Each completion of an exercise movement is called
a repetition. In theory, you could do almost any number of
repetitions (one to thousands). However, in practice, most
people  attempt  5  to  10  repetitions  of  each  exercise.  Each
group of repetitions is called a set. Weight trainers generally
perform three to five sets of each exercise. For example, if
you were doing 3 sets of 10 repetitions of the bench press
exercise, you would perform 10 repetitions of the exercise,
rest  for  1  to  2  minutes,  then  repeat  the  process  two  more
times for a total of three sets consisting of 30 repetitions.

The American College of Sports Medicine (www.acsm.org),
the premier professional organization for sports scientists,
recommends  that  beginners  practice  only  one  set  of  each
exercise.  They  cite  studies  that  show  that  doing  one  set
increases strength just as much as doing two or more sets.
If you practice only one set, make sure it is high intensity.
The advantage of one-set training is that kids can work out
quickly and have time for skill training. Practice more sets
if you want to make faster progress or reach higher levels of
strength.

The  amount  of  rest  between  sets  depends  on  the  athlete’s
fitness  goals.  When  trying  to  develop  combined  strength
and endurance through resistance exercise, rest for one to
two minutes between sets. If the goal is to develop maximum
strength, one may rest up to five minutes or more between
sets. In this case, the goal is to exert maximum force during
the  exercise.  This  will  be  impossible  without  adequate
recovery from the prior exercise.

order oF exercISeS
If  the  primary  goal  is  to  gain  strength,  do  large  muscle
exercises such as presses, pulls, and multi-joint lower body
exercises  before  attempting  exercises  for  smaller  muscle
groups,  such  as  wrist  curls  and  calf  raises.  Doing  small
muscle  exercises  fatigues  these  muscles,  causing  them  to
limit performance when working on larger muscle groups.

SaFeTY and
PrevenTIng InjurY
Even  experienced  professional  athletes  often  forget  the
primary purpose of exercise training—to stimulate the body
to improve its function. Children who exercise improperly
or  overtrain  will  not  improve.  Worse,  they  may  become
injured or ill.

Kids should perform all of the exercises properly. A child’s back is extremely vulnerable
to  the  unnecessary  stress  on  the  spinal  vertebrae  that  can  be  caused  by  poor  lifting
technique. Observe the following seven principles when lifting any weight:

1.  Lift the weight with the legs rather than the back, emphasizing hinging at the
hip and not at the spine. The legs and buttock muscles are the strongest in the
body. The muscles surrounding the spine are small and vulnerable.

2.  Keep the weight close to the body when lifting. This promotes lifting the

weight with the legs and hips rather than the back.

3.  Keep the back straight and the head level when picking up a weight from the

ground.

4.  Lift the weight smoothly from the ground.

5.  Do not twist the torso when lifting a weight. This puts abnormal pressure on

spinal muscles and disks.

6.  Children should not lift if they are tired and unable to use proper lifting tech-

nique. They should always lift within their capacity.

7.  When using weight machines, make sure they are adjusted properly to the

child’s body. Children should sit properly to support their spines.

Warm-up before performing resistance exercises. Warming up increases the temperature
of muscles, which makes them work more efficiently and prevents injury. It also helps
spread synovial fluid throughout the joint and protects vulnerable joint surfaces. Warming
up also helps reinforce motor patterns within the brain, which allows an individual to
perform the exercise more efficiently.

Children should complete a few “total body” warm-up exercises before beginning their
workouts,  such  as  easy  treadmill  running,  jumping  jacks,  or  stationary  cycling.  Also,
they should do some easy repetitions of each exercise before upping the resistance. For
example, an athlete doing squats with 150 to 300 pounds should do 6 to 10 repetitions of
the exercise with a lighter weight (i.e., 135 pounds or unloaded squats) before attempting
heavy weights.

Breathing
Proper  breathing  is  important  during  weight  training  exercise.  Breath  holding  and
straining (called a valsalva maneuver) increases blood pressure and may cause kids to
faint. In general, exhale during the active phase of the lift and inhale when returning to
the exercise starting position. For example, in the bench press, inhale when lowering the
weight to the chest and exhale when pushing the weight.

valsalva maneuver: Expiratory
effort against a closed glottis,
which increases pressure within
the thoracic cavity and thereby
impedes venous return of blood
to the heart.

International Sports Sciences Association156  |  unit 11

Decorum in the Weight Room
While being sociable is an enjoyable aspect of lifting weights, do not let it interfere with
progress  or  safety.  Children—even  high  school  students—love  to  play  around  in  the
weight room. This can be dangerous. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC;  www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/5028.html)  estimates  that  each  year  about
8,700 children under 5 years of age are injured with exercise equipment. There are an
additional 16,500 injuries per year to children ages 5 to 14. Teach kids to be aware of their
surroundings and follow these rules:

1.  Do not walk close to moving weight stacks or people doing lifts.

2.  Be particularly cautious around people doing dynamic lifts such as cleans,

snatches, or kettlebell swings.

3.  Do not disturb people doing heavy lifts. This may distract them and cause

them to either miss the lift or get injured.

collars: Devices to hold weight
plates on barbells or dumbbells.

Spotting
Use an experienced spotter whenever you are doing a lift that could result in injury from
a falling weight or a missed lift. Spotters can also assist when doing the lift, thus allowing
for an increase in the overall exercise intensity. A spotter can help a person complete a lift
that they ordinarily might miss. Instruct young athletes in proper spotting techniques.

Collars
Collars are devices that hold the weights on the bar. Athletes should always use collars
when they lift. Without collars, weights can easily slip off the bar and cause injury. Light-
weight collar clips are effective for keeping the weights secured to the bar.

Clothing
Wear workout clothes that will not get caught in the machines or interfere with exercise
performance. When doing leg exercises such as squats, cleans, or snatches, kids should
wear shorts that will not tear during the motion. Shoes should be closed toe and provide
good support when lifting dynamically. Sexually well-developed girls and young women
should wear sports bras that provide good breast support.

Youth FitnessMuscle Strength  |  157

Weight Lifting Supplies
Weight  lifting  belts  help  support  the  spine  and  help  an  individual  to  maintain
good posture during lifts. Young athletes should not wear belts because it prevents the
development of trunk muscles during weight lifting. However, belts will help the athlete
lift more weight. Serious weight trainers often wrap their knees and wrists for additional
support.  Weight  training  can  create  hand  calluses,  so  some  people  use  weight  lifting
gloves to prevent them. Weight lifting supplies such as belts, wraps, and shoes can be
purchased at sporting goods stores or through a variety of fitness magazines.

bASIC WEIghT TRAININg ExERCISES
There are literally hundreds of weight training exercises. The most popular exercises for
the  major  muscle  groups  are  listed  in  Table  11.1. This  unit  of  the  course  will  describe
some  of  the  most  popular  exercises  that  can  serve  as  the  basis  for  beginning  strength
training programs. They are appropriate for children interested in general fitness. Athletes
interested in developing power should do more whole body, functional training exercises.

cheST and Shoulder exercISeS
The major muscles include the pectoralis major (chest), deltoid (shoulders), and trapezius
(upper shoulder, upper back, and neck). Presses such as the bench press and the incline
press  are  best  for  developing  these  muscles.  Exercises  that  isolate  specific  muscles  are
also helpful. For example, fly exercises, which bring the arms across the chest, isolate the
pectoralis major muscles (large chest muscles, one on each side).

weight lifting belts: Belts
that stabilize the spine and
abdominal region during
weight lifting. Children should
avoid using them because they
hinder the development of core
stabilizing muscles.

Dumbbell Flys

International Sports Sciences Association158  |  unit 11

Bench Press
This  is  a  popular  exercise  that  works  the  muscles  of  the
chest,  shoulders,  and  arms  (pectoralis  major,  deltoid,  and
triceps  muscles).  It  can  be  done  with  barbells,  dumbbells,
kettlebells, or weight machines. If you are using a barbell, it
is best to employ a spotter and a bench with a built-in rack.

Upright Row
This  exercise  develops  the  deltoids,  biceps,  and  trapezius
muscles. It is particularly useful for athletes who need strong
neck muscles such as football players, wrestlers, and martial
artists. This exercise can be done with barbells or dumbbells
in either an upright or bent over position.

Directions:  Lie  on  a  bench  face-up,  with  feet  flat  on  the
floor.  Start  with  arms  extended  and  the  weight  over  the
chest,  and  grasp  the  bar  at  approximately  shoulder  width.
Lower the weight to the chest under control, and then push
the weight to the starting position.

Bench Press

Upright Row

Directions:  Stand  with  the  feet
shoulder  width  apart  and  grasp  the
bar  in  the  middle  with  the  hands
approximately four inches apart and
the  arms  fully  extended.  Pull  the
weight upward until the bar reaches
the collar bone. Return the bar to the
starting position.

Deltoid Raises
Deltoid raises develop your deltoids,
the round-like muscles that form the
shape  of  the  shoulders.  Because  of
the  shape  of  this  muscle,  one  must
do this exercise to the front (anterior
deltoid),  side  (lateral  deltoid),  and

Seated Press
This  exercise  develops  the  deltoids,  triceps,  and  trapezius
muscles. The standing or military press has been a popular
exercise  for  more  than  150  years.  However,  many  people
bend  their  low  back  excessively  when  doing  this  exercise,
which  increases  the  risk  of  injury  to  spinal  muscles  and
vertebral  disks.  Variations  of  the  seated  press  include  the
standing  barbell  or  dumbbell  press  (military  press),  the
push  press,  and  the  seated  dumbbell  press.  There  are  also
many  weight  machines  for  performing  seated,    standing
overhead, and behind the neck presses.

Directions: Sit on a bench,
preferably  one  with  back
support. Begin by grasping
the bar at shoulder width,
with  the  bar  resting  on
the chest. Push the weight
straight overhead and fully
extend the elbows. Return
the  weight  to  the  starting
position.

back  (posterior  deltoid)  to
develop all of its parts.

Front Raises
(anterior deltoid)
Directions:  Stand  with  your
arms  at  your  sides  and  your
elbows  extended  and  hold
a  dumbbell  in  each  hand.
With the palms down and the
arms  straight,  raise  the  right
arm  until  it  is  level  with  the
shoulder  in  front.  Lower  the
weight to the starting position
and repeat the exercise using
your left arm.

Deltoid Raises

Side Raises (lateral deltoid)
Directions: Stand with the arms at the sides and the elbows
extended, holding a dumbbell in each hand. With the palms
down and the arms straight, raise the right arm until it is
level with the shoulder to the side. Lower the weight to the
starting position and repeat the exercise using the left arm.

Back Raises (posterior deltoid)
Directions: From a standing position, bend at the waist and
stand with the arms at the sides and the elbows extended,

arm exercISeS
Arm  exercises  are  popular  with  weight  trainers.  The  two
major arm muscles include the biceps brachius, which flexes
or bends the elbow, and the triceps brachius, which extends
or straightens the elbow.

Biceps Curls
Kids can do biceps curls with barbells, dumbbells, or biceps
curl  machines.  Curl  bars,  which  position  the  forearms  at
a  45°  angle,  are  popular  because  they  place  less  stress  on
the  forearms  during  the  exercise.  One  can  also  isolate  the
upper arm during the exercise by using special curl benches
(i.e.,  preacher  stand).  Many  other  exercises  also  develop
the  biceps;  these  include  lat  pulls,  pull-ups,  upright  rows,
cleans, and snatches.

Directions:  Grasp a  barbell at  shoulder width with palms
facing  outward.  Stand  with  the  elbows  extended  and  the
arms  against  the  body.  Keep  the  elbows  close  to  the  body
and  flex  the  elbows,  bringing  the  bar  to  the  chest.  Return
to  the  starting  position.  Use  the  biceps  muscles  to  lift  the
weight, and do not “cheat” by swaying the body.

holding  a  dumbbell  in  each  hand.  With  palms  down  and
arms straight, raise the right arm to the rear as far as possible.
Lower  the  weight  to  the  starting  position  and  repeat  the
exercise using the left arm.

uPPer bacK exercISeS
The major muscles of the upper back include the trapezius
(“traps”),  the  latissimus  dorsi  (“lats”),  and  the  rhombiods.
The upright rowing exercise, already described, is excellent
for developing the traps. Pulling exercises, such as the clean
and  snatch,  kettlebell  snatches,  and  barbell  or  dumbbell
presses, are also excellent for developing the major muscles
of the upper back.

Lat Pulls
This  exercise  requires  a  lat  machine.  There  are  two  basic
types of lat machines: a free standing machine that uses the
person’s  body  weight  for  stabilization  during  the  exercise;
the other has a seat that restrains the body with a seat belt
or thigh support. If using heavy weights on a free-standing
machine, the lifter will always need a spotter. Variations of
this  exercise  include  pull-ups  and  pull-overs  (machine  or
free weights).

Directions: From a seated or kneeling position (depending
on  the  machine),  grasp  the  bar  overhead  with  the  hands
placed beyond shoulder width apart. Pull the bar down until
it reaches the chest, and then return to the starting position.

Biceps Curls

Triceps Pushdowns
This  exercise  uses  the  lat  machine  to  build  the  triceps
muscles (muscles on the back of each arm). Other exercises
that  isolate  the  triceps  using  barbells,  dumbbells,  and
exercise  machines  include  French  curls,  supine  bench
triceps extensions, and parallel bar dips. Pressing exercises
such as the bench press, the incline press, the military press,
and the jerk also develop the triceps muscles.

Directions: Stand facing the lat machine. Grasp the bar with
the hands approximately four to six inches apart and with
the palms facing the body. Fully extend the arms with the
elbows held closely at the side. From this starting position,
with  the  elbows  locked  to  the  side,  allow  the  hands  to  be

pulled  up  to  your  chest,  and  then  firmly  push  the  weight
back to the starting position. If the elbows move during this
exercise, the person has “cheated.”

across the chest, curl the trunk using the rectus abdominus
muscle,  while  minimizing  movement  of  the  head  and
shoulders. The back should remain stationary.

Triceps Pushdowns

Curl-ups

ThIgh and
gluTeal exercISeS
Leg and thigh muscles are much more important for sports
performance than arm, chest, and shoulder muscles. Yet visit
almost any gym and you will observe many people focusing
on bench presses and curls and very few people emphasizing
squats and power cleans. To improve performance in sports
where one runs, jumps, or transfers body weight from the
back  to  front  foot  (e.g.,  tennis,  golf,  baseball,  softball,  or
boxing),  perform  exercises  that  develop  the  large  muscles
of  the  legs  and  hips.  Exercises  for  these  muscles  include
squats, front squats, cleans, snatches, lunges, step-ups, knee
extensions, leg curls, jerks, push-presses, and calf raises.

The lower body major muscle groups include the quadriceps
(quads:  muscles  on  the  front  of  the  thighs),  the  gluteus
maximus  (the  large  buttocks  muscle),  the  hamstrings
(the back of the thighs), and the calf muscles (the back of
lower  legs).  The  quadriceps  and  hamstrings  move  the  hip
and  knee  joints.  The  quads  extend  or  straighten  the  knee
and flex or bend the hip. The hamstrings flex the knee and
extend the hip. Squats and step-ups use the knees and hips
to work the hamstrings and quadriceps during the pushing
or concentric phase of the lift.

Squats
This  exercise  requires  a  barbell  and  a  squat  rack.  These
racks might not fit some young athletes. Many people like
a squat rack with a safety platform to the side where they
can rest the weight if they fail to complete the lift. Use one
to  two  spotters  if  you  are  attempting  a  squat  with  heavier
weights.  During  this  lift,  it  is  crucial  to  use  collars  and  to
make sure to adjust the squat rack properly for the person’s

abdomInal exercISeS
Abdominal muscles are important for health, performance,
and  appearance.  These  muscles  help  stabilize  the  spine,
which  prevents  back  pain.  For  rotational  movements,
emphasize rotating from the hips while maintaining a stiff
and  neutral  spine.  Rotational  movements  are  critical  in
sports that require weight transfer such as tennis, baseball,
bowling, throwing (baseball, discus, javelin, and hammer),
karate, and boxing. Rotating with the spine without using
the  hips  produces  weak,  less  powerful  motions  and  puts
the spine at risk. Strong abdominal muscles are important
to  stabilize  the  trunk  in  almost  all  movements  that  use
large muscles (i.e., running and jumping). Muscles include
the  rectus  abdominis,  internal  and  external  obliques,  and
transversus abdominis. Curl-ups are the principle exercise
for  these  muscles.  However,  any  exercise  that  stabilizes
the  core  muscles—such  as  planks,  kettlebell  swings,  and
cleans—also build these muscles.

Curl-ups
Curl-ups  are  a  variation  of  the  sit-up  abdominal  exercise.
Full  sit-ups  are  not  necessary  to  develop  fully  trained
abdominals. The abdominal muscles receive a tremendous
workout  by  moving  through  a  restricted  range  of  motion.
Curl-ups are just as effective as sit-ups, and they place less
stress on the back.

Directions: Lie on the back on the floor with one leg straight
and  the  other  foot  flat  on  the  floor.  With  the  arms  folded

Calf Raises
Directions:  Using  a  calf  machine,  stand  with  the  toes  on
the  platform,  with  the  heels  extending  from  the  edge  of
the  board  and  weight  pads  resting  comfortably  on  each
shoulder. Rise up on the toes and then return to the starting
position. As children gain strength, they should allow their
heels  to  go  below  the  level  of  the  platform. This  increases
strength and calf-Achilles tendon flexibility.

height. Squats strengthen the quadriceps, gluteus maximus,
hamstrings, and calf muscles.

Directions:  Place  the  bar  so  that  it  rests  on  the  fleshy
part  of  the  upper  back.  Grasp  the  bar  with  the  hands
for  support.  Some  people  like  to  put  a  pad  on  the  bar  to
increase comfort. Stand with the feet shoulder width apart
with  toes  pointed  slightly  outward.  Keep  the  head  up  and
the back straight during the lift. Squat down until the thighs
are  approximately  parallel  with  the  floor.  Drive  upward
toward  the  starting  position,  maintaining  a  neutral  spine
throughout  the  lift.  Never  “bounce”  at  the  bottom  of  the
squat—this could damage knee ligaments.

Squats

Hamstring Curls
This exercise requires a curl machine. As discussed, squats
also develop the hamstrings. The standing hamstring curl is
also a good exercise for these muscles.

Directions:  Lie  face  down  on  the  bench  with  the  heels
under  the  pad.  Make  sure  the  knee-caps  are  not  touching
the  bench.  Keeping  the  knees  flat  on  the  bench,  flex  the
knees maximally, and then return to the starting position.
Hamstring curl machines are too large for most children—
even for many high school kids.

exercISeS For The calveS
The  gastrocnemius  and  soleus  are  the  two  major  calf
muscles. These muscles plantar flex the ankle, which means
they work when lifting the heels and going up on the toes.
These muscles are important for jumping and running, and
are developed by putting weights on the shoulders, using a
barbell or calf machine, and raising the heels off the ground.
Whole body exercises that can also bulid the calves include
the snatch, squat, and clean.

Calf Raises

TraInIng ProgramS
There are countless variations of weight training programs.
You  will  need  to  individualize  each  program  to  meet  the
goals  of  the  client.  Start  with  a  general  warm-up  such  as
easy-pace  exercise  on  a  treadmill  or  stationary  bicycle  for
one to two minutes. Do large muscle bench press and squat
exercises before smaller muscle exercises, such as biceps and
hamstring curls. Do all the sets for an exercise before moving
to the next sequence of exercises. Refer to Table 11.1 on the
following page for recommended sets and repetitions.

Power athletes can develop significant strength and muscle
fitness by performing three to four whole body functional
training exercises in a workout. The take home message is
to do the program regularly and progressively.

SuMMARY

Children can make substantial gains in strength, power, and muscle mass safely by lifting weights and performing
resistance exercises using their own body weight. Keep it fun and build strength gradually and consistently. Children
should develop good whole body movement skills as soon as they begin their training and exercise programs. Chil-
dren should train movements, not muscles. They should maintain a stiff spine during most movements so that the
major core muscles act as a spring for force transfer from the lower body to the upper body. All children should
learn to hinge at the hips rather than in the spine when doing squats, lifting from the floor, and performing
rotational exercises.

Poor lower body movement skills impair the ability to learn deadlifts, cleans, and snatches. Test the child’s capacity to
perform basic lower body movements before including weight-bearing squats or step-ups in the weight training pro-
gram. Kettlebells are excellent for introducing the concept of the hip hinge and spinal stiffness. Children also benefit
from more traditional strength training methods. A guiding principle for weight training or sports training in general
is that “good technique does not hurt.” Fatigue is a natural part of sports training, but pain— particularly if it persists
after exercise—indicates a training error. Young athletes interested in high power sports should center their programs
around whole body exercises that includes squats, lunges, step-ups, push-presses, cleans, snatches, kettlebell swings,
bench press, and deadlifts.

Key Terms

plyometrics

stretch-shortening cycle

plyometrics: Resistance
training technique that uses
muscle stretch followed
immediately by muscle
contraction; an example is box
jumping.

stretch-shortening cycle:
An active stretch (eccentric
contraction) of a muscle
followed by an immediate
shortening (concentric
contraction) of that same
muscle.

JuMPINg AND PLYOMETRICS
Kids do jumping and plyometric exercises naturally. Plyometric exercises are excellent
for building basic muscle strength, power, and speed. They help build bone mass in girls,
which protects them against fractures as they age. The exercises are fun and challenging
for children and should be included into every physical education program.

Jumping  exercises  and  plyometrics  enhance  performance  in  strength-speed  sports
because they increase leg power and train the nervous system to activate large muscle
groups quickly during movement. The exercises in this section of the course enhance the
capacity for single “explosive” movements such as jumping, throwing a discus, baseball
or softball, and hitting a golf or tennis ball.

Plyometric exercises involve rapid stretching then shortening of a muscle group during
highly  dynamic  movements  (i.e.,  stretch-shortening  cycle).  Stretching  causes  a
stretch  reflex  and  elastic  recoil  in  muscles—which  combined  with  a  vigorous  muscle
contraction—creates  great  force  that  overloads  the  muscles,  increases  strength  and
power, enhances the strength of connective tissues that promote muscle elasticity, and
improves tendon strength.

Plyometrics range in difficulty from calf jumps off the ground to multiple one-leg jumps
to and from boxes. Calf jumps are simple plyometric exercises involving jumping in place
repeatedly using mainly calf muscles. After landing on the ground after the first jump, the
calf muscles stretch as they help control the landing. The recoil from the stretch adds to
the force of the muscle contraction for the next jump.

The basic principle for all jumping and plyometric exercises involves absorbing the shock
with the arms or legs and then immediately contracting the muscles. For example, when
doing  a  series  of  squat  jumps,  jump  again  as  quickly  as  possible  after  landing.  More
muscle overload occurs when jumps are made in rapid succession. These exercises train
the nervous system to react quickly.

In untrained people, the nervous system reacts slowly when “turning on” the muscles
during repeated muscle contractions, such as those that occur during calf jumping. This
protective reflex is designed to protect the legs from injury. With conditioning, a trained
nervous system reacts more quickly and activates leg muscles rapidly. Stronger muscles
and joints no longer need the reflex protection.

Jumping and plyometric exercises can cause great stress to the muscles, bones, and joints.
All exercises in this section are considered moderate to high impact.

Do not do these exercises more than two to three days per week. If you feel pain in your
muscles and joints for hours or days after a workout, modify your program or stop doing
the exercises that give you trouble.

Youth FitnessJumping and Plyometrics  |  165

This  section  begins  with  simple,  relatively  low  impact
exercises. More difficult exercises are presented later in the
section. Do not attempt advanced exercises until you are in
excellent condition and can perform the exercises without
pain. Start by doing one to two sets of about three to four
exercises.  As  you  become  better  conditioned,  build  up  to
three sets of 6 to 10 exercises. Do these exercises with perfect
form and intensity. It is better to do only one set correctly
than many sets incorrectly and at a reduced speed.

STaTIonarY PlYomeTrIcS
Start  with  these  simple  exercises  before  progressing  to
movements  that  place  more  stress  on  your  muscles  and
joints. With these exercises, you jump to and from the same
place on the ground. More advanced exercises will progress
to repeated distance jumps and then to box jumps.

Calf Jumps
This basic exercise helps to develop jumping power in the
calf  muscles.  This  is  an  excellent  beginning  exercise  for
children of all skill levels.

Directions:  Stand  with  feet  shoulder  width  apart  with
hands on hips. Bend at the knees slightly. Using mainly calf
muscles, jump rapidly in place for 10 repetitions.

Variations:  Advanced  variations  include  calf  jump  spins
and  one-leg  calf  jumps.  With  calf  jump  spins,  attempt  to

spin as you jump, eventually going 360° between jumps. Do
one-leg calf jumps the same way as two-leg jumps, except
lift one leg off the ground when doing the exercise.

Rope Skipping
Rope  skipping  is  essentially  the  same  as  calf  jumping,
except that it is more vigorous. This is an excellent exercise
for  conditioning  the  non-oxidative  energy  system  and
developing jumping power, particularly in the calf muscles.
Do this exercise using either “boxer” or playground style. In
boxer style, you use a short rope and jump by yourself. In
playground style, two people swing the rope while a third
person jumps. The boxer style is the most practical of the
two types.

A  recent  television  program  describing  the  “new  physical
education” showed children skipping rope with an imaginary
rope. The idea was that rope skipping damaged self-esteem
because  of  its  difficulty.  While  the  personal  trainer  might
introduce the activity with an imaginary rope, encourage the
child to learn rope-skipping skills. Self-esteem is developed
best through accomplishment. If everyone is a winner, then
there is no winner and no competition.

Good jump ropes can be purchased at almost any sporting
goods store. The best ones are made of leather with wooden
handles and ball-bearing swivels. With these, the rope turns
easily  in  the  hand  without  tangling.  Buy  one  that  fits  the
athlete—it  should  not  be  so  short  that  the  athlete  cannot

so long that it is difficult to turn.

Directions:  Hold  one  handle  in  each  hand  with  the  rope
behind you. Swing the rope over your head and jump over
it  when  it  reaches  your  feet.  Continue  swinging  the  rope
and jumping over it. Speed up the tempo as skill improves.
Begin with 5 to 10, 15-second segments and progress to 5 to
20, 1 to 3 minute segments.

As  skill  improves,  teach  the  athlete  some  of  the  many
rope-skipping  variations.  These
include  crossing  the
hands  in  front  while  jumping  and  swinging  the  rope  for
two  revolutions  between  jumps.  Vary  foot  movements  so
they  resemble  running  or  dancing.  Using  a  heavy  rope  or
wearing a weighted vest increases the conditioning effect of
rope skipping.

Squat Jumps
These  are  similar  to  calf  jumps,  except  the  jumper  bends
the knees and squats between jumps. This basic exercise is
excellent for improving jumping power and is an important
part of any plyometric program.

Directions: Stand with feet shoulder width apart with knees
bent slightly. Jump up and drive the arms upward. As you
land, retract the arms and squat down and then jump again
as quickly and explosively as possible. Do 5 to 10 repetitions
per set.

Squat Jumps

Tuck Squat Jumps
These  are  similar  to  squat  jumps,  except  more  vigorous.
Jump higher off the ground to perform the knee tuck and
still achieve a balanced landing.

Directions:  Stand  with
feet shoulder width apart
with knees bent slightly.
Jump  up  and  drive  the
arms  upward.  Tuck  the
knees underneath when
reaching  the  height  of
the  jump.  On  landing,
extend
legs  and
arms  and  prepare  to
jump  again.  Do  5  to  10
taking  as
repetitions,
little  time  as  possible
between jumps.

Tuck Squat Jumps

Mule Kick Squat Jumps

This  is  another  variation  of
squat jumps.

Directions:  Stand  with  feet
shoulder  width  apart  with
knees  bent  slightly.  Jump  up
and  drive  the  arms  upward.
At  the  height  of  the  jump,
the  heels  backwards
kick
and  touch  the  back  of  the
thighs.  On  landing,  extend
the  legs  and  retract  the  arms
and  prepare  to  jump  again.
Perform  5  to  10  repetitions,
taking as little time as possible
between jumps.

Mule Kick Squat Jumps

360° Squat Jumps
This  exercise  is  another  variation  of  squat  jumps  similar
to  the  360°  calf  jumps  described  earlier.  It  requires  more
fitness  than  most  squat  jumps.  Start  with  45  to  90°  turns
and progress to 360° turns.

Youth FitnessDirections:  Stand  with  feet  shoulder  width  apart  with
knees  bent  slightly.  Jump  up  and  drive  the  arms  upward,
spinning in the air as much as possible. On landing, retract
the  arms  and  prepare  to  jump  again.  Begin  by  rotating  in
only  one  direction.  For  the  progression,  rotate  to  the  left
on one repetition and to the right on the next. Do 5 to 10
repetitions, taking as little time as possible between jumps.
Advanced  variations  of  this  exercise  include  tuck  and
mule-kick 360s.

Jumping and Plyometrics  |  167

One-Leg Squat Jumps
Do not attempt this exercise until the person has conditioned
their legs with two-leg squat jumps. Progress slowly; if any
ankle, knee, or hip pain occurs following this exercise, cut
down on the volume or eliminate it from the program.

Directions:  Stand  on  one  leg  with  the  knee  bent  slightly.
Jump up and drive the arms upward. On landing, retract the
arms and immediately jump again. Do 5 to 10 repetitions,
taking as little time as possible between jumps.

Variations  (all  advanced):  1-leg  tuck  squat  jumps,  1-leg
mule kick squat jumps, 1-leg 360° squat jumps.

360° Squat Jumps

Pike Jumps
This  is  another  advanced  exercise  that  requires  superior
jumping and power output capacity.

Directions:  Stand  with  feet  shoulder  width  apart  with
knees bent slightly. Jump up and drive the arms upward. At
the  height  of  the  jump,  extend  the  legs  outward  in  a  split
position. On landing, retract the legs and arms and prepare
to jump again. Do 3 to 10 repetitions, taking as little time as
possible between jumps.

One-Leg Squat Jumps

Ice Skaters
This exercise is excellent for developing the thigh muscles
for  lateral  movements  and  for  stabilizing  spinal  muscles
for  dynamic  movements.  Make  sure  shoes  provide  good
traction and choose an area that provides good footing.

PIke Jumps

Ice Skaters

International Sports Sciences Association168  |  unit 12

Directions:  Stand  with  weight  on  the  inside  part  of  the
feet. Using a speed skating motion, drive off the left leg and
swing both arms to the right, then immediately drive with
the right leg to the left. Move as quickly as possible when
going from one leg to the other.

Variations: Sand Ice Skaters. Do the ice skater exercise in the
sand. This is a good way to begin doing this exercise because
the knee, hip, and ankle joints receive less stress. This method
can  also  strengthen  stabilizer  muscles.  Another  variation
uses angled boxes. Wedge shaped boxes allow better footing
during  the  push-off  phase  and  are  popular  with  skaters
and  skiers.  A  slideboard  also  can  be  used.  Slideboards  are
available  commercially  or  can  be  manufactured  cheaply
using a piece of Formica and 2 x 4 lumber.

Lunge Jumps
The  lunge  or  split  jump  builds  thigh,  gluteal,  and  back
muscles. It is an excellent exercise to develop striding power
for sprinting and lower body flexibility.

Directions:  From  a  standing  position,  jump  up  and  then
land in a split position with the right leg bent and left leg
extended behind. After landing, immediately jump up and
again  land  in  a  split  position  with  the  legs  reversed.  One
repetition  occurs  when  each  leg  has  been  in  the  forward
position. During this exercise, try to keep the body straight
and jump up as high as possible.

Lunge Jumps

horIzonTal
jumPS and hoPS
These  more  advanced  exercises  involve  jumping  and
hopping  horizontally,  which  are  excellent  for  developing
basic leg power.

Standing Long Jumps
In  addition  to  increasing  basic  leg  power,  this  is  a  good
exercise for gauging progress. Measure the athlete’s standing
long jump every two weeks. Progress is rapid and rewarding
as the athlete improves.

Directions: Stand with feet shoulder width apart and toes
just  behind  the  starting  (scratch)  line.  Bend  the  knees,
bringing  the  hands  below  waist  level,  then  jump  as  far
forward  as  you  can  by  extending  ankles,  knees,  hips,  and
arms fully.

Standing Long Jumps

Multiple Standing Long Jump
This  is  similar  to  the  last  exercise,  except  that  the  athlete
takes three jumps in succession.

Directions: Stand with feet shoulder width apart and toes
just  behind  the  starting  (scratch)  line.  Bend  the  knees,
bringing the hands below waist level, and then jump as far
forward  as  you  can  by  extending  the  ankles,  knees,  hips,
and  arms  fully.  On  landing,  try  to  jump  again  as  soon  as
possible. Repeat for three total jumps.

Standing Triple Jump
The triple jump is contested in track and field competitions.
It used to be called the “hop, step, and jump,” which describes
its basic movements.

Directions: Stand with feet shoulder width apart and toes
just  behind  the  starting  (scratch)  line.  Bend  the  knees,

Youth FitnessStanding Triple Jump

Jumping and Plyometrics  |  169

bringing the hands below waist level, and then jump as far
forward  as  you  can  by  extending  the  ankles,  knees,  hips,
and arms fully. Land on the same leg as the starting leg of
takeoff, then step vigorously with the other leg. On landing,
immediately jump with that leg and complete the exercise.
A sequence might be to hop with the right leg, extend and
land on the left leg (step), then complete the jump with the
left leg.

Cone Hops
This exercise is similar to the multiple standing long jumps,
except try to jump for height over the cones and for distance.

Directions:  Space  three  to  six  large,  two-foot  cones  (or
similar  objects)  approximately  three  feet  apart.  Stand  in
front of the first cone with feet shoulder width apart. Jump
over the cones as quickly as possible.

Skiers
Skiers is a good exercise for alpine and cross-country skiers,
skaters, and for people who must change direction rapidly
when running.

Directions:  Stand  with  feet  together.  Jump  with  both  feet
together  forward  and  to  the  left  side;  land;  then  jump
forward and to the right. Jump as quickly as possible for 5
to 10 repetitions. One repetition includes a jump to the left
and right sides.

Skiers

Four Squares
This exercise helps build leg power for lateral movements.

Directions: Stand with feet together on the inside of four
markers  (small  cones,  shirts,  shoes)  placed  approximately
five  feet  apart.  Keeping  the  feet  together,  jump  in  various
patterns  in  the  direction  of  the  markers.  For  example,  if
the  markers  are  numbered  1,  2,  3,  4,  a  jumping  sequence
might  be:  1,  center,  2,  center,  3,  center,  4,  center.  Another
combination  might  be:  center,  1,  2,  4,  3,  center.  Many
combinations are possible.

Cone Hops

Hurdle Hops
This is an advanced form of cone hopping using hurdles. Do
not  attempt  this  exercise  unless  you  are  well–conditioned
and have good jumping ability and technique. If the hurdles
have adjustable stabilization weights, make sure they are set
so that the hurdle falls down easily if hit. Construct mini-
hurdles from PVC pipe, as these are safer for the beginner.

Directions: Place three to five hurdles approximately three
feet  apart.  Start  with  the  hurdle  at  its  lowest  height.  Keep
feet shoulder width apart, and hop over the hurdles quickly
with both legs.

bounce PuSh-uPS
Perform  bounce  push-ups  against  a  wall,  steeplechase
hurdle,  or  on  the  floor. These  are  excellent  for  developing
upper body pushing power.

Wall Bounce Push-ups
These  are  the  simplest,  least  stressful  push-ups.  Start  with
these  until  the  muscles  and  joints  become  accustomed  to
the stress of upper body plyometrics.

Directions:  Lean  against  a  wall  or  steeplechase  hurdle
at  a  45  to  60-degree  angle.  Push  up  forcefully,  then  allow
yourself to go back against with the arms absorbing the fall.

Floor Bounce Push-ups

off in a modified push-up position and graduate to the full
push-up position when you gain the necessary strength and
power to complete the exercise.

box jumPIng
Box jumping involves jumping to and from boxes, benches,
or steps. Landing imparts much more stress to the muscles
and joints, so these exercises should only be attempted after
doing  exercises  where  you  jump  to  and  from  the  ground.
Box height varies from approximately six inches to five feet.
Start off with smaller boxes and progress slowly to higher
ones.  As  with  other  plyometric  exercises,  the  object  is  to
jump as soon as possible after landing.

Step Downs
This is the simplest, least stressful box jump. Begin with a
low box approximately one to two feet high. This exercise
progresses  from  simply  stepping  down  from  the  box  and
absorbing the shock with the legs to jumping down, landing,
then vigorously jumping into the air. Finally, jump between
a series of boxes.

Directions: Phase 1: Step down. Stand on a box or bench
with feet shoulder width apart, knees bent, and spine erect.
Step off the box and land with knees bent.

Phase 2: Step down, jump up: Stand on a box or bench with
feet at shoulder width, knees bent, and spine erect. Step off
the bench and land with bent knees, then immediately jump
up using both legs and arms.

Wall Bounce Push-ups

Floor Bounce Push-ups
These are much more stressful and difficult than wall push-
ups. Do not attempt these until you can do at least 10 to 15
push-ups. Perform these from a regular or modified push-
up  position.  In  the  modified  push-up  position,  rest  your
weight on the knees instead of toes.

Directions: From a standard or modified push-up position,
push  up  forcefully,  extending  the  elbows  fully  until  your
hands leave the ground. Bounce back to your hands, then
repeat the exercise.

Variation: “Clap” bounce push-ups (Marine push-ups). Do
this exercise as described above, except clap your hands after
your hands leave the ground. In this sequence, you push up
and leave the ground, clap your hands, bounce back to the
push-up position, and repeat.

Variation: “Rocky Balboa” one-arm push-ups. This difficult
one arm exercise was popularized in the movie Rocky. Do
it the same way as bounce push-ups described above. Start

Youth FitnessJumping and Plyometrics  |  171

Ski Box Jumps
This exercise, similar to “skiers” described earlier and occurs
when you jump to and from a box as you jump side-to-side.

Directions:  Stand  sideways  to  a  box  or  bench.  With  feet
together, jump up vigorously onto the box, then immediately
jump to the ground on the other side, then jump back to the
box, then jump back to the starting position, and so on.

Step Downs

Phase 3: Repeat the step down, jump up: Place three to six
boxes or benches approximately three feet apart. Jump from
the first box to the ground, then up to the next box, then
to  the  ground,  and  so  forth.  Jump  as  quickly  as  possible
between boxes.

Standing Long Jumps from a Box
This is similar to the standing long jumps described earlier,
except that it stresses your legs much more when you land.
This exercise is sometimes called “depth jumping.”

Directions:  Stand  on  a  box  or  bench  with  feet  placed
shoulder  width  apart.  Jump  as  far  forward  as  possible,
extending  fully  at  the  ankles,  knees,  hips,  and  arms.  Land
with  bent  knees.  Increase  box  height  as  fitness  improves.
A variation of this exercise is to land on the ground, then
standing long jump again immediately.

Ski Box Jumps

Single Leg Jump-ups
This  exercise  isolates  the  powerful  thigh  muscles  and
develops jumping power for activities that require a single
leg take-off (i.e., a lay-up in basketball or jumping for a ball
when running).

Directions: Stand on one leg with knee bent slightly. Drive
hard with the leg and extend fully at the ankle, knee, and hip
and jump into the air, land, and then repeat immediately for
a set number of repetitions. Repeat with the other leg.

medIcIne ball exercISeS
A medicine ball resembles a basketball in size but is heavier
and softer and is usually made of leather. Newer medicine
balls  are  sometimes  made  of  rubber,  and  some  even  have
handles.  Medicine  balls  weigh  between  2  to  20  pounds.
Because  of  their  weight,  medicine  balls  are  excellent  for
plyometrics.  When  you  catch  medicine  balls,  the  muscles
stretch  and  contract  eccentrically  as  you  slow  down  and
control the ball. You can perform medicine ball exercises by
yourself or with a partner.

Play Catch with Yourself
Do  this  exercise  with  the  ball  starting  from  your  chest,
behind the neck, or at the waist. These are excellent whole
body exercises because you must engage the legs, arms, and
trunk to perform them properly.

Directions:  Chest-high  catch:  Stand,  feet  shoulder  width
apart,  holding  the  ball  with  both  hands  at  chest  level.
Vigorously press the ball overhead with both hands until it
flies  into  the  air  straight  above  you.  Use  your  legs  to  help
push the ball overhead. Catch the ball with both hands, then
immediately throw the ball into the air again. Repeat.

Directions:  Behind-the-neck  catch:  Stand  with
feet
shoulder  width  apart  and  hold  the  ball  with  both  hands
behind your head. Vigorously press the ball overhead with
both hands until it flies into the air straight above you. Use
your  legs  to  help  push  the  ball  overhead.  Catch  the  ball
behind your head with both hands, then immediately throw
the ball into the air again. Repeat. Do not do this exercise
if you have existing shoulder problems. Instead, start with
a two to five-pound medicine ball before
progressing to a heavier one.

Directions:  Waist-high  catch:  Stand
with  feet  shoulder  width  apart  and  place
your  hands  under  the  ball  at  waist  level.
Vigorously  pull  the  ball  overhead  with
both hands until it flies into the air straight
above you. Use your legs to help push the
ball  overhead.  Catch  the  ball  with  both
hands,  then  immediately  throw  the  ball
into the air again. Repeat. As you become
accustomed to this exercise, jump into the
air  as  you  throw  the  ball,  land,  catch  the
ball, and repeat.

Play Catch with Yourself

Medicine Ball or Shot Put Throws
You  also  can  develop  power  by  throwing  a  medicine  ball
or  shot  put  in  various  ways.  Exercises  include  overhead,
underhand, and side-rotation throws.

Directions: Overhead throw: The exercise motion is similar
to  the  underhand  catch  described  previously,  except  that
you throw a medicine ball or shotput over your head behind
you. Throw  the  object  as  far  overhead  as  possible.  Extend
fully with the ankles, knees, hips, and arms, and jump from
the ground while releasing the ball.

Directions: Front-waist throw: This is also an underhand
throw initiated at the waist, except that you throw the ball or
shot put it in front of you. You can also throw the ball from
your waist in front of you or rotating to the side.

Directions: Waist throw to the side: Hold the ball or shot
in both hands. Rotate to the right then to the left and throw
the object as far as possible. Transfer your weight from the
rear to the front foot during the throw. Repeat the exercise
on the other side of the body.

These exercises, excellent for developing power in the upper
and lower body, have many variations limited only by your
imagination.  Try  changing  up  your  routines  to  keep  it
interesting and keep kids motivated.

Chest Passes
This  exercise  is  excellent  for  developing  the  upper  body
pushing  muscles,  including  the  muscles  of  the  trunk  and
lower body.

Directions: Stand with one foot in front of the other, with
knees bent slightly, approximately 6 to 10 feet from a partner.
Hold  the  ball  in  both  hands  at  chest  level  and  throw  it  to
your  partner  using  a  motion  similar  to  a  basketball  chest
pass.  Your  partner  should  catch  the  ball  and  immediately
throw  the  ball  back  to  you.  The  catching  motion  should
blend  continuously  with  the  throwing  motion  in  a  semi-
circular pattern. You also can perform this exercise from a
kneeling position to isolate upper body muscles.

Youth FitnessJumping and Plyometrics  |  173

Medicine Ball Sit-ups
Two athletes can do this together, or one person can do it
alone with a spotter. Do not attempt this exercise until you
have  conditioned  your  abdominal  and  back  muscles  with
standard sit-ups, crunches, and back extensions.

Directions: Two-person sit-ups: Sit facing each other with
knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and one person holding the
medicine ball. Both people should go backward with hands
overhead until their backs touch the ground, then both sit
up  at  the  same  time.  As  the  person  with  the  ball  reaches
the top of the sit-up, toss the ball to the other person who
then catches it. Repeat the exercise by tossing the ball to the
other person at the top of each sit-up. The sequence for each
person is as follows: Sit-up with the ball, throw the ball to
partner, sit-up without the ball, and catch the ball from the
partner, then repeat.

Directions: One person with spotter: This is similar to the
two-person sit-ups, except a spotter or coach stands three
to  five  feet  from  the  person  doing  the  sit-ups.  At  the  top
of  the  sit-up,  the  person  tosses  the  ball  to  the  spotter  and
then completes a sit-up without the medicine ball. He or she
returns to the top of the sit-up and catches the ball thrown
by  the  spotter. The  sequence  is  as  follows:  Sit-up  with  the
ball, throw the ball to spotter, sit-up without the ball, catch
the ball from spotter, then repeat.

Chest Passes

Overhead Passes
This  excellent  exercise  develops  power  in  the  triceps  and
shoulder muscles. Do not perform this exercise if you have
any type of shoulder injury.

Directions: Kneel facing your partner, approximately 6 to
10 feet away. Hold the ball in both hands behind your head.
Throw  the  ball  forward  over  your  head  so  your  partner
catches it with arms extended overhead. Your partner then
retracts the ball overhead and throws it back to you.

SuMMARY

Jumping exercises and plyometrics enhance performance in strength-speed
sports because they increase leg power and train the nervous system to activate
large muscle groups quickly during movement. Plyometric exercises involve
rapid stretching then shortening of a muscle group during highly dynamic
movements (i.e., stretch-shortening cycles). Stretching causes a stretch reflex
and elastic recoil in the muscles, which combined with a vigorous muscle
contraction, creates great force that overloads the muscles, increases strength
and power, enhances the strength of connective tissues that promote muscle
elasticity, and improves tendon strength. The basic principle for all jumping and
plyometric exercises involves absorbing the shock with the arms or legs and
then immediately contracting the muscles. Jumping and plyometric exercises
can cause great stress to the muscles, bones, and joints. Start with simple exer-
cises before progressing to movements that place more stress on the muscles
and joints. More advanced exercises progress to repeated distance jumps and
then to box jumps using two legs and then one leg.

power: Work per unit of time.
From a practical standpoint,
defined as ability to exert force
rapidly.

Children develop less power in sports and have a lower capacity for power development
than  adults  because  they  have  less  muscle  mass  and  are  neurologically  immature.
Nevertheless, research studies have shown that children as young as six can build strength
and power through training, which will help them perform better in sports. Also, they
can learn techniques to help them throughout their athletic careers.

In sports, power is the ability to produce force rapidly. It is the most important fitness
component in high intensity sports such as tennis, football, soccer, basketball, most track
and field events, field hockey, ice hockey, downhill skiing, golf, lacrosse, volleyball, and
baseball. People move quickly and forcefully in these sports. How hard you strike a ball,
how fast you move on the court or field, or how rapidly and precisely you apply force to
the edge of the ski dictates the quality of performance.

Power  is  also  important  for  distance  running,  cycling,  swimming,  and  cross-country
skiing.  Endurance  refers  to  the  capacity  to  sustain  a  given  exercise  intensity.  Except
perhaps for marathon dancing (an event popular during the 1930s where you danced “till
you dropped”), there are no purely endurance events. Endurance sports are contested
over  finite  distances. The  winner  simply  completes  the  distance  in  the  fastest  time.  In
other words, the winner represents the most powerful person over the contested distance.
While endurance is obviously important in these events, athletes require power—even in
endurance sports.

This section describes exercises to develop speed and power for gross movements such
as sprinting and changing directions on the court or field. These exercises compliment
plyometric exercises that also help to develop speed and power in large lower and upper
body muscle groups.

# Elements Of Power
Power in sports depends on five main factors:

1.  genetics

2.  metabolic capacity

3.  muscle size

4.

skill

5.  nervous system capacity

With the exception of genetics, the athlete or client’s training program must address each
factor to maximize power for sport.

Youth FitnessPower and Speed  |  177

geneTIcS
Great  athletes  such  as  Alex  Rodriguez  (baseball),  Michael
Jordan and LeBron James (basketball), Tiger Woods (golf),
Usain Bolt (sprinting), and Mohammed Ali (boxing), were
born with the capacity to produce great power when they
moved. They are the “geniuses” of the sports world. Just as
giants in other disciplines, such as Einstein, Beethoven, and
Newton,  were  born  with  great  intellect,  superstar  athletes
are  born  with  a  gift  for  generating  power  on  the  playing
field.  They  had  to  train  hard  to  become  stars,  but  they
started from a much higher level than the rest of us. Average
people cannot expect to equal the physical prowess of these
superstars, no matter how hard they train. However, almost
everyone can improve performance in strength-speed sports
by systematically developing the components of power.

meTabolIc caPacITY
We  have  already  discussed  the  metabolic  basis  of  exercise
in  Unit  2  of  this  course.  To  summarize,  each  sport  relies
primarily on one of the three energy systems—immediate,
non-oxidative,  or  oxidative.  While  these  energy  systems
are  important  to  sustain  life,  specific  sports  tend  to  rely
on one system more than the others. For example, weight
lifters  rely  primarily  on  the  immediate  system;  400-meter
sprinters  rely  primarily  on  the  non-oxidative  system;  and
marathon  runners  rely  primarily  on  the  oxidative  system.
To  maximize  power,  one  must  develop  the  energy  system
that sustains movement in a particular sport. This is one of
the  major  tenants  of  the  specificity  of  metabolic  capacity
related to specific sports.

muScle SIze
For  more  than  150  years,  athletes  have  practiced  strength
training  to  make  them  more  powerful.  Today’s  athletes
are much bigger and stronger than those of 40 to 50 years
ago, largely because of weight training. In the 1950s, it was
common  to  see  200-pound  linemen  in  football.  Compare
that  with  average  weights  of  over  320  pounds  on  today’s
teams. Many of today’s baseball players have forearms like
Popeye,  while  pre-1960  players  usually  had  very  ordinary
looking muscular builds.

In women’s popular sports such as swimming, track and field,
softball, field hockey, softball, volleyball, alpine skiing, and
basketball, extensive weight training has produced athletes
with  well-developed  muscles.  Performance  differences
between men and women are due largely to differences in
power output capacity. Weight training has helped women
to narrow the gender gap in many sports. Children cannot
develop  power  as  well  as  adults  can,  but  they  can  make
significant progress. They can develop proper sports skills,
which are vital for powerful performance.

A  muscle’s  size  largely  determines  how  much  force  it  can
develop.  Larger  muscles  have  more  tissue  to  contract,  so
they exert more force. In sports, the rate at which muscles
exert force remains more important than the absolute force
in determining sports performance. While weight training
is  important  for  developing  power  for  sports,  it  will  not
be  effective  unless  one  learns  to  use  the  newly  acquired
strength  effectively  in  the  sport.  Effective  strength  (i.e.,
usable strength in the sport) is determined by how well the
nervous  system  controls  the  muscles  and  by  the  skill  and
efficiency of movement.

skill: Ability to perform a
discrete motor task.

SKIll
Skilled performers make it look easy. They exhibit an economy of effort with little wasted
motion. They concentrate all their forces into their movements and perform seemingly
flawless actions. The power produced by an NBA superstar dunking the ball, an Olympic
discus thrower throwing over 70 meters, or a world-class ballet dancer soaring through
the air seems beyond human capacity. These feats are possible because these athletes can
precisely channel their incredible power into skilled movements.

Skill is the capacity to perform a specific movement. Skilled movements are orchestrated
by the nervous system so that body positions and muscle contractions occur in precise
sequences  and  speeds.  Practice  and  training  reinforce  correct  movements  to  produce
better, more skillful performances. At the same time, the object is to eliminate inefficient
or incorrect movements.

Skill is a prerequisite to successful performance in sports regardless of physical condition.
An individual cannot become effective in a sport without a certain amount of skill. A
highly skilled Olympic gymnast, for example, would do poorly on the golf course unless
they developed a mechanically sound and efficient golf swing. Gymnasts would need to
learn how to coordinate their upper and lower body movements during the golf swing
in  the  same  way  they  did  when  mastering  movements  on  the  balance  beam  or  rings.
Athletes in any skilled sport must direct most of their energies toward developing skill.
A basic premise of this course is that practicing the skill must never take a back seat to
general physical conditioning.

Many athletes mistakenly emphasize weight training at the expense of skill development.
Strength gained in the weight room transfers slowly to the playing field. In fact, one can
increase strength by 20 to 30 percent in the weight room without improvement in power
in a sports movement. Only if one carefully practices the desired skill will movements
become more powerful. Powerful, skilled movements depend on purposeful skill practice
and conditioning.

Skill can overcome physical and conditioning deficiencies. Proper body positions, use of
leverage, and timing can produce great force. Athletes are less likely to become injured
when  they  move  skillfully.  Skilled  movements  depend  on  good  movement  postures,
which place less stress on the bones, muscles, and joints.

Technology and Skill
We live in a marvelous age for honing sports skills. Even the
average person can use videotape and computers to improve
technique in any motion, even without a coach.

The procedure is simple. All one needs is a home computer
with  video  capture  and  a  video  camera.  Video  transfer
capability  is  now  standard  on  home  computers  (e.g.,
iMovie).  Download  a  computer  video  clip  of  a  sports
movement from the Internet. These are widely available for
any sport in both Macintosh and Windows formats. Take a
video of the client or athlete performing a skilled movement
(examples include hitting a tennis forehand, hitting a driver
in golf, sprinting, or crushing a softball). Transfer the video
into the computer. Compare your technique with that of the
expert.  A  knowledgeable  coach  can  detect  and  emphasize
important points.

nervouS SYSTem caPacITY
The  nervous  system’s  ability  to  recruit  or  activate  motor
units  (muscle  fibers  plus  a  motor  nerve)  is  critical  for
generating  power.  Scientists  have  discovered  that  motor
units are trained only if they are recruited during practice.
The large, powerful motor units are only recruited during

maximum,  powerful  movements.  To  train  those  motor
units, one must perform maximum, explosive movements
during the exercise sessions.

High  resistance  weight  training  helps  to  recruit  these
difficult-to-train  motor  units.  Doing  high  speed  training
exercises  and  plyometrics  overloads  the  motor  units  that
make  individuals  run  fast,  jump  high,  and  throw  far.  Not
only are these “performance” motor units turned on, they
are  also  activated  longer  to  be  able  to  sustain  powerful
movements in sports.

As  with  strength  training,  plyometric  and  speed  exercises
are only effective for improving sports performance if they
are accompanied by a mimicking of the skill during practice.
Research studies show that simultaneously practicing speed
and  plyometric  exercises  and  the  skill  produces  rapid
improvement  in  sports  performance.  Strength  training
takes  much  longer  to  transfer  to  skilled  movement.  In
contrast,  weight  training  and  speed-plyometric  training
both  eventually  produce  more  powerful  movements  if
integrated into a long-term, systematic program.

This  section  of  the  course  describes  basic  speed  and
power  exercises.  Combined  with  weight  training,  general
conditioning, and skill development, these exercises almost
assure improvement in sports performance.

International Sports Sciences Association180  |  unit 13

SPRINTINg
In  sprinting,  peak  power  occurs  during  the  first  20  to  30
meters.  One  can  only  sustain  peak  power  for  about  3
seconds before it drops off. In a sprint 100 or 200-meter run,
the winner is the person with the highest peak power output
and the least slow-down at the end of the race (power and
speed-endurance).

In  most  power  sports,  critical  movements  last  only  a  few
seconds but require great power. For example, in football,
plays  seldom  last  more  than  three  seconds.  In  tennis,  you
move from a “ready” position, set up for the shot, and then
execute  the  stroke.  Again,  these  critical  movements  take
only  a  few  seconds.  In  skiing,  power  applications  occur
when setting the edge. The remainder of the turn involves
unweighting  and  setting  up  for  the  next  turn.  Highly
skilled baseball and softball players exert great force when
hitting  the  ball,  base  running,  or  making  a  play  in  the
field. Movements in these sports are maximum and highly
explosive for a few seconds. The rest of the time, the players
are largely inactive.

When developing power for sports, one needs to enhance
the capacity to accelerate from a stationary position to full
speed in a short time while changing directions rapidly. The
athlete can build these capacities with a proper training and
conditioning program.

Technique  is  critical  for  powerful  movement.  When
sprinting,  either  laterally  or  in  a  straight  line,  powerful

movements  depend  on  getting  your  power  leg  under  you
(i.e., cut or claw foot) and on full extension of your legs and
hips. The large muscles in the front and back of the thighs
and hips are the strongest in the body. The athlete must use
these muscles to their full capacity for sprinting, moving to
hit a tennis ball, or jumping for a basketball.

If  you  train  your  athletes  to  move  efficiently  and  extend
fully during powerful movements, they will run faster and
jump  higher.  Be  systematic—analyze  their  motions  and
change them systematically using videotape and computer
analysis. These insights are no longer limited to the research
lab. Computerized performance systems can turn you into a
space-age sports scientist.

Sprint Starts, Running
Sprint  starts  are  excellent  for  developing  power  and
acceleration capacity in the legs. The photo sequence shows
proper sprint starting technique. The athlete in this sequence
is a world-class sprinter. Notice the incredible extension he
gets as he bursts from the blocks. Training to develop this
kind of “explosive” strength may carry over to other sports
that require power and speed.

Use starting blocks when working on sprint starts, although
they  are  not  absolutely  necessary.  Football  players  should
do sprint starts from the football stance. Tennis, soccer, or

Sprint Starts, Running

Youth FitnessPower and Speed  |  181

baseball players should do starts from the ready position in
their sport. The ready position is the waiting position before
initiating a powerful first movement.

Directions:  “On  your  marks  position”:  Your  feet  are
staggered 10 to 14 inches apart, with your front foot placed
approximately 20 inches from the starting line. Try to relax
in this position.

“Set  position”:  Raise  your  back  and  hips.  Your  front  leg
bends  about  90°  and  your  rear  leg  120°.  Right-handed
people generally start with their left foot forward. Your back
is flat, and your hips are slightly higher than your shoulders.
You contact the ground with your fingertips so you can raise
your  shoulders  as  high  as  possible.  Do  not  put  too  much
weight on the fingertips.

“Go”: Raise your shoulder so you can direct force with your
front driving leg through the length of your body. Drive the
front leg fully so the body forms a straight line from your hip
to your heal. Push your rear foot hard against the block or
ground as you powerfully drive your knee forward. As you
drive forward, the arm on the side of the front foot drives
straight  forward,  while  the  rear  foot  arm  drives  straight
backward. Both arms are bent approximately 90 to 110°. Try
to extend fully with your hips and knees and use your arms
dynamically  during  the  driving  phases  of  the  movement.
After the start, run as fast as possible for three to five strides.

Start  off  with  three  sprints  starts  and  progress  to  10  to  20
starts  as  fitness  increases.  After  two  weeks,  have  someone
time your starts to gauge your progress. Also, videotape your
starts to insure you are extending fully at the hips and knees.

Sprint Starts, Swimming
Swimmers can develop acceleration capacity by working on
starts.  Starts  are  beneficial  for  those  who  want  to  develop
basic  leg  power  but  also  want  to  increase  variety  in  their
training program.

Modern  starting  technique  uses  an  arc  dive  to  enter  the
water.  The  swimmer  extends  the  body  up  and  out.  At  the
top of the arc, swimmers bend at the waist so they enter the
water at relatively steep trajectories. This technique allows
the swimmer to travel further over the water and enter the
pool more cleanly than using a flat dive technique. Serious
swimmers use the arc dive technique. However, it does not
matter which technique is used when swimming for general
fitness conditioning.

Directions:  Start  from  the  side  of  the  pool  or  from  a
swimming  starting  block.  Grasp  the  front  of  the  block  or
side  of  the  pool  with  head  down  and  knees  bent  slightly.
Pull against the block or poolside as you lift your head and

Sprint Starts, Swimming

flex  your  knees.  Drive  your  body  and  arms  upward  and
outward, fully extending the hips, knees, ankles. If doing an
arc dive, pike at the waist as you reach the peak of the dive.
In the flat dive, continue to extend fully with the hips, knees,
ankles, and shoulders. Enter the water as cleanly as possible
by  attempting  to  make  the  body  enter  the  same  “hole”  in
the water.

As with sprinting, do no more than three to five strokes after
hitting the water. Start with three to five starts and progress
to 15 to 20 as fitness improves.

Short Sprints (running)
Shorts  sprints,  ranging  from  20  to  50  meters  help  to
develop  lower  body  power  and  acceleration  for  improved
performance in most strength-speed sports. As with sprint
starts, emphasize full extension of the knee and hip during
the  driving  phase  of  the  sprint  movement.  Powerful  arm
movement  is  critical  to  fast  sprinting.  Drive  the  arms
forcefully  in  the  direction  of  movement.  Do  not  flail  the
arms to the side.

International Sports Sciences Association182  |  unit 13

Short Sprints

Directions:  Start  with  longer
distances of 50 to 100 meters at
less  than  top  speed.  As  fitness
improves, increase speed until
you  can  sprint  at  100  percent
effort. Discontinue the exercise
if  you  feel  any  pain  or  muscle
cramping. Begin with three to
five  repetitions  with  30  to  60
seconds  rest  between  sprints;
gradually  increase  to  10  to  20
repetitions.

Proper  technique  helps  the
person  run  faster  and  with
more power. Try to extend the
hips  fully  during  the  push-off
phase  of  the  sprint.  Vigorous
arm action also helps one move
faster and more powerfully.

Lateral  sprinting:  Lateral  sprint  movements  are  excellent
for preparation for field sports such as football, soccer, and
field  hockey.  They  also  improve  power  in  sports  such  as
tennis, racquetball, basketball, and volleyball.

Using cones, shoes, or shirts, set up a zigzag course where
you run straight for five yards, run left at a 45° angle for five
yards, then run right at a 45° angle. Another variation is to
place two cone or shoe markers 10 yards apart. Sprint from
the first marker to the second, touch it, and then sprint back
to the first marker.

Backward sprinting: This is an excellent exercise for those
who  must  occasionally  sprint  backward  in  their  sport,
athletes such as defensive backs in football, basketball, and
soccer. Backward sprinting develops hamstring and gluteal
power.  Run  distances  of  10  to  50  yards  and  progress  in  a
manner similar to that of the short sprint exercises.

Downhill Sprinting
(2 to 3 percent grade)
Sprinting  downhill,  using  a  mild  downgrade,  allows  you
to  increase  your  running  speed  and  thus  overload  your
fast-twitch  motor  units.  This  technique  can  improve  your
sprint speed rapidly. The Dallas Cowboy football team has
a downhill track made of Tartan (expensive material used
in  all-weather  tracks)  for  developing  sprint  speed  in  their
athletes.

Directions:  Find  a  small  hill  that  declines  about  2  to  3
degrees. A football field with a steep crown (higher in the
middle than on the sides) is a good choice. Sprint 3 to 10

repetitions  at  distances  ranging  from  20  to  40  yards.  Do
not sprint down a steep hill (> 5°) because you risk injury
and much of your energy will be devoted to keeping your
balance rather than running fast.

Speed Parachute
Speed  parachutes  also  overload  fast-twitch  motor  units
during  high-speed  sprinting.  Russian  sprint  coaches
developed  this  device.  You  can  purchase  power-training
parachutes at track and field supply companies and at some
sporting goods stores.

Directions:  Attach  one  to  three  parachutes  to  the  waist
belt. Start with one and add chutes as condition improves.
As  with  the  short  sprints,  run  20  to  50  yards  for  3  to  15
repetitions.  Do  not  try  parachute  exercises  until  you  have
first run short sprints for two to three weeks.

A useful technique is to run 10 to 20 yards with the chutes,
then release the chutes. This causes you to suddenly surge
forward, which overloads the larger fast-twitch motor units.

Harness Sprinting
A variation to the parachute, this involves wearing a harness
around  the  waist  and  pulling  a  weight  sled,  truck  tire,  or
another person who provides resistance. Vary the speed and
resistance—the  more  resistance,  the  slower  the  speed  and
vice versa.

Harness Sprinting

Low Hurdles
Low, 32-inch hurdles are useful for developing sprint speed
and jumping power. Most high schools and colleges leave
their hurdles on or near the track, at least during the winter
and  spring  track  season.  If  hurdles  are  unavailable,  use
large cones or picnic benches. One can even use imaginary
hurdles. If using hurdle substitutes, make sure they topple
over when hit.

Directions:  Set  up  three  to  four  hurdles,  preferably  on
grass, 9.3 yards (8.5 meters) apart. The starting point is 15

Youth Fitnessyards  (13.72  meters)  from  the  first  hurdle.  Make  sure  the
hurdle supports face you; you want the hurdle to fall over if
you hit it. In hurdling, you want to stride rather than jump
over the hurdle. The take-off distance should be far enough
away  from  the  hurdle  so  the  leading  leg  sweeps  forward
and  upward  in  a  straight  line.  Jumping  too  close  to  the
hurdle causes you to jump over the hurdle. You will strike
the hurdle if the distance is too long. The stride across the
hurdle  must  follow  the  normal  sprinting  stride  smoothly.
This takes confidence, which only comes from practice.

The  hurdling  movement  starts  with  a  quick  forward  and
upward thrust of the leading leg toward the hurdle. As you
clear the hurdle, actively press your leg toward the ground.
The trailing leg extends fully as you stride toward the hurdle.
Once  you  clear  the  hurdle,  bend  your  knee  and  stretch  it
away  from  your  body.  Extend  your  opposite  arm  forward
for balance as you go over the hurdle. Try to take only three
strides between hurdles.

Start  off  with  only  one  hurdle.  When  you  hurdle  it  with
confidence, add more hurdles. When you can run the entire
three  to  four  hurdle  course,  move  to  three  to  four  sets  of
hurdles,  gradually  increasing  your  speed.  As  you  become
more proficient, run 6 to 10 sets of hurdles. Time your runs
to gauge progress.

Stadium Stairs
Running stairs is a “tried-and-true” technique for developing
leg power. The local football stadium is a great place to do
this  exercise  because  it  overloads  your  body  during  the
sprinting motion.

Directions:  Find  unobstructed  stairs  to  support  your
weight. Beware of old wooden football stadiums seats that
could  collapse  when  you  run  on  them.  The  number  of
repetitions will vary with the size of the stadium. Running
up the stadium stairs at a major university’s football stadium
will be much more difficult than at the local high school. As
with other kinds of sprint exercises, start conservatively and
build up the intensity and duration as fitness improves.

Variations  of  stadium  stair  running  include  running  two
steps  at  a  time,  hopping  up  the  stairs  on  one  or  two  legs,
and hopping up the stairs using a side-to-side motion. The
latter is a good exercise for alpine skiers. Advanced athletes
can increase the resistance by doing stadium stair exercises
while wearing a weighted vest. These are available at sporting
goods stores and through track and field supply catalogs.

Be  careful  when  running  or  hopping  up  stadium  stairs,
particularly  when  going  down  the  stairs.  You  can  easily
lose your balance and get seriously injured. Have the client

Power and Speed  |  183

stop if they lose their balance or equilibrium. In addition,
this  exercise  may  not  be  a  good  idea  for  individuals  with
kneecap  pain.  Stair  climbing,  particularly  going  down
stairs, produces considerable pressure on kneecaps. When
experiencing  kneecap  pain  the  next  day  or  several  hours
after  running  stadium  stairs,  the  athlete  should  cut  down
on  training  volume  or  eliminate  the  exercises  from  the
prescribed program.

Stair  climbing  machines,  while  excellent  for  developing
cardiovascular  endurance,  are  less  effective  than  running
stadium  stairs  for  developing  lower  body  power.  Doing
stadium  stairs  forces  the  legs  to  extend  vigorously  during
the push-off phase of the running stride and absorb shock
when landing. This develops dynamic strength in the legs,
which is not possible using stair climbing machines, because
it requires minimal stride length and little or no impact.

Stadium Stairs

High-knees, Fast Arms
This  exercise  is  excellent  for  developing  sprint  power.
It  helps  to  increase  stride  frequency,  one  of  two  factors
determining  sprint  speed  (the  other  being  stride  length).
Minimize impact by doing this exercise on a grass field or
wooden gym floor. This is a maximum intensity exercise. It
is better to do one set of 10 seconds at maximum effort than
10  sets  of  20  seconds  at  50  percent  effort.  This  exercise  is
effective only when performed at maximum intensity.

International Sports Sciences Associationpower  in  sports  provided  skill  practice  also  occurs.  This
type of training is extremely high intensity and has a higher
risk of injury. Also, it is easy to overtrain. Overtraining is an
imbalance between training and recovery. Athletes become
overtrained  when  they  do  not  get  enough  rest  between
workouts or the workouts are too hard.

Start gradually and progress slowly. Choose one or two of
these  exercises  and  add  more  as  the  athlete  gets  in  better
shape. Gauge the appropriateness of workouts by how clients
feel the next day. If they are extremely sore for one or two
days after a power workout, then they have done too much.
In other words, teach children to listen to their bodies.

Peak Power Training on the
Stationary Bicycle (Cycle Ergometer)
The stationary bicycle is excellent for developing leg power.
By training at peak power output, one develops “explosive”
leg strength that will transfer to other sports. Also, it builds
the energy systems important in power sports.

Power  on  a  stationary  bicycle  combines  pedal  revolutions
(rpm) and resistance (i.e., frictional resistance measured in
kiloponds  or  kps).  Achieving  peak  power  output  requires
an optimum combination of resistance (kps) and leg speed
(rpms).  Too  high  a  resistance  decreases  power  output
because the rpms will be low. Likewise, if the resistance is
too low, power will also be low because of limited capacity
to increase pedaling speed.

Determining  Optimal  Frictional  Resistance
for
Stationary  Bicycling  Power  Training  Find  a  bicycle
ergometer  that  allows  you  to  adjust  the  frictional
resistance (examples include Monark and Tunturi cycle
ergometers). Set the frictional resistance at 1 kp. Warm-up
by  pedaling  at  an  easy  pace  for  approximately  2  minutes.

184  |  unit 13

Directions: Simulate a sprint motion in a nearly stationary
position,  and  pump  the  arms  and  lift  the  knees  as  fast  as
possible. Try to complete 20 strides in only 10 yards. Begin
with three repetitions (3 sets of 10 yards). Gradually progress
to 10 to 20 repetitions.

High Knees and Fast Arms

Bounding Strides
This exercise helps build stride length for sprinting. Rather
than take many strides in a short distance (as in the high-
knee, fast arms exercise), attempt to take as few strides as
possible over a longer distance.

Directions:  Do  this  exercise  on  a  grass  field  or  running
track over a distance of 50 to 100 yards. Stride as long as
possible, moving the arms vigorously in synchrony with the
legs. Strides should resemble bounding jumps. Begin with
two to three repetitions and progress to 10 repetitions.

POWER TRAININg
Power training requires the athlete to exercise at maximum
intensity.  This  is  the  only  way  to  overload  the  large,  fast
motor  units.  This  training  is  very  effective  and  improves

Youth FitnessPower and Speed  |  185

Then, ride as fast as possible for 30 seconds and count the
total  number  of  pedal  revolutions.  Every  time  the  right
leg  extends,  count  as  one  pedal  revolution.  Multiply  the
pedal revolutions by 1; the result is the power index. Rest
for 5 minutes, and then repeat the procedure using 2 kps.
Multiply the pedal revolutions by 2. Rest for five minutes,
and  repeat  using  3  kps.  Repeat  the  procedure  until  the

Table 13.1
Sample Procedure - Determining Peak Power

KP Setting

Max Revolution
in 30 sec.

Power Rating

product  of  pedal  revolutions  and  kps  begins  to  decline.
Select the kp setting that produces the highest power rating.
In this example, power output decreased when going from a
frictional resistance of 3 kps to 4 kps. Choose 3 or 3.5 kps as
the friction for “power rides.”

Set the kps at the max power setting, sprint as fast as possible
for  30  seconds.  Begin  with  three  to  five  sets  of  30-second
sprints.  As  fitness  improves,  increase  to  10  to  15  sets  of
30-second sprints. Rest three to five minutes between sets.

Use  this  technique  to  develop  power  for  time  intervals
ranging  from  10  seconds  to  10  minutes.  The  principle
remains the same. Count pedal revolutions for the desired

exercise time. The longer the time interval, the lower the kp
setting. For longer time intervals, the goal is to maintain a
given power output (Table 13.1).

Peak Power Weight Training
One can use the peak power training technique with weight
training,  as  well.  The  principle  remains  the  same  as  for
stationary  cycling.  Calculate  your  peak  power  output  for
five repetitions of an exercise. In general, use a weight that
is 50 to 60 percent of the maximum weight you can lift for
one repetition. Time how long it takes you to complete five
repetitions  with  good  form.  Perform  the  lift  as  rapidly  as
possible.  It  is  essential  to  employ  good  lifting  technique
when using this method.

Directions:  Calculate  the  peak  power  workout  weight  for
your lift. Table 13.2 displays training weight for the bench
press. In this example, the lifter bench presses 300 pounds
for one repetition. Begin with a weight approximately 40 to
45 percent of the best one-rep lift. It is a good idea to use
a  rubber  bounce  pad  on  the  bar  to  protect  against  injury.
Time how long it takes to bench press five reps, lifting the
weight as rapidly as possible with good form. Do not cheat
on the lift; go all the way down and all the way up. Repeat this
procedure for weights that represent 50, 60, and 70 percent
of the one-rep-maximum bench press. Your workout weight
will be the one that renders the highest pounds per second.

In this example, peak power output occurred at 50 percent
of  maximum.  The  workout  weight  should  be  150  to  170
pounds. Perform three to five sets of five repetitions at that
weight, pushing the weight as quickly as possible. Increase

Speed Ladder

weight when the client or athlete can perform sets in less than five to six seconds. This
is a highly effective training technique that produces rapid gains in strength and power.

Bench Throws
The bench throw is a highly dynamic bench press that involves pushing the weight rapidly,
letting  go  of  the  bar  momentarily,  and  catching  it  again.  While  the  lift  is  effective  for
building power, it is potentially dangerous. Children should not do this exercise without
an experienced spotter (single spotter standing in back of the lifter). A safer alternative is
to do bench throws on a Smith machine—a weight machine with a bar attached to a track
allowing for vertical movment and little or no forward/backward movement.

AgILITY TRAININg
Agility  is  the  capacity  to  rapidly  change  speed  or  direction  during  whole  body
movements. Children’s games such as hopscotch build agility. Other common types of
exercises for building agility include speed ladders, dot drills, and cone drills. Trainers
and coaches can improvise to create agility drills appropriate for specific sports.

Speed Ladder
The main objective of agility ladder programs is to promote a wide range of different foot
and movement patterns. Through practice, these movements will become second nature
and the body will be able to respond quickly to various sport specific movement patterns.
With the use of an agility ladder, we can improve our agility by practicing movement
patterns in training. The standard ladder is 10 yards long with 18 inch squares. But you
can construct your own ladder using sticks, lino strips, or tape.

When beginning an agility ladder program, start with two to four drills. And once you
master these, then introduce new drills.

Forward Running, High-Knee Drill: This drill is great for improving foot
speed and coordination for all field sport athletes. Run with high knees
forward  through  the  ladder,  touching  every  ladder  space.  Land  on  the
balls of the feet and drive forward with your arms.

Lateral  Running,  Side-to-Side  Drill:  The  lateral  movement  of  this  drill
is great for court-sports and improves knee and ankle stability, as well.
Keep a low center of gravity and step side-to-side through the ladder one
foot at a time. Touch in each rung of the ladder with both feet. Land on
the balls of the feet and repeat right to left and left to right.

Dot Drills
Dot  Drills  develop  dynamic  leg  strength  and  increase  knee  and  ankle
strength and stability. This is a great agility drill for anyone who plays field
or racket sports or those who need to make quick changes of direction
and landings, such as skiers and basketball players.

Use a Dot Drill Mat or place small “X” marks with tape in a on the ground
in a pattern of a five on a Dice.

Youth FitnessPower and Speed  |  187

Begin with a warm up and jump from dot to dot with both
feet  at  a  time.  Progress  to  one  foot  hopping  and  follow  a
specific jump pattern.

Cone Drills (weave in/out)
This  is  an  excellent  drill  for  developing  and  maintaining
lateral (sideways) agility.

1.  Place four cones in a straight line about 3 yards/

meters apart.

2.

In between each pair of cones, place another cone
about 3 yards/meters to the left.

3.  Sprint from one cone to the next, touching each

one with your hand.

4.  Try to take quick side steps, rather than turning to

face the marker and running forward.

FuNCTIONAL TRAININg
All the exercises that follow are functional training exercises.
Trainers can design clever training programs using common
everyday  items  such  as  heavy  stones,  heavy  bars  (farmer’s
bars),  sledge  hammers,  throwing  implements  (e.g.,  shot,
hammer,  weight,  javelin,  discus),  sleds,  backpacks,  pulley
machines,  and  parachute  cord.  Trainers  can  also  design
whole body exercises using barbells, dumbbells, resistance
bands, and kettlebells.

Stone Training
These  stones  ranging  in
weight from 2 pounds to
more than 200 pounds are
excellent training aids for
children  and  adults.  The
best thing about stones is
that they are free. You can
find  smooth,  well-worn
stones  in  any  streambed.
You  can  also  purchase
Atlas  stones  in  a  variety
of  weights  that  are  made
from  small  stones  and

chests and do front squats, lunges, or sprints; they can hold
them  above  their  heads  and  do  overhead  squats;  or  they
can  throw  them  overhead  or  underhand  with  two  hands.
Children  can  also  use  them  to  add  resistance  to  common
movements  such  as  hopping  or  jumping.  Make  sure  the
child uses good posture when doing these exercises to avoid
injury.

Carry Exercises
Carrying  heavy  objects  is  an  effective,  low-cost  way  of
building  whole  body  strength  and  power.  Carry  exercises
build  grip,  core,  leg,  and  upper  body  strength  that  can
transfer to almost any sport. These exercises are simple: hold
a  kettlebell,  dumbbell,  farmers  bar,  or  weighted  suitcase
in either one or both hands and walk with them for 20 to
100 yards. Add variety by simultaneously pulling a sled or
wearing a backpack.

Sledgehammer Training
Hitting a sledgehammer against a tire or log is a great way
to  build  whole  body  strength  and  power.  The  handle  of  a
sledgehammer  is  made  of  wood  or  fiberglass  and  ranges
in  length  from  10  to  36  inches.  Sledgehammers  weight

between 2 and 20 pounds and can be purchased at hardware
and  garden  supply  stores.  Chopping  wood  is  a  similar
training method that has been used to condition athletes for
hundreds of years.

Functional Training Machines
These  machines  are  made  by  manufacturers,  such  as  Life
Fitness  and  Cybex  amongst  many  others.  They  allow  a
variety  of  overloaded  functional  movements  that  build
strength and power for sports.

OLYMPIC WEIghT LIFTINg
Olympic  weight  lifting—more  correctly  called  weight
lifting—is  a  competitive  sport  and  includes  the  clean  and

jerk  and  the  snatch.  These  are  extremely  dynamic  lifts  that  work  the  large  muscles
of  the  upper  and  lower  body.  While  the  power  gained  in  these  lifts  does  not  transfer
immediately to sports skills, they provide a strength and power base that will eventually
help you improve in many power sports.

Posture and technique are critical for preventing injury and making satisfactory progress.
A good coach will help students avoid common mistakes and help them progress rapidly
in these exciting and beneficial exercises.

The Clean and Jerk
This  exercise  is  excellent  for  developing  power  in  the  muscles  used  for  jumping  and
pulling objects from the floor. It is a core exercise for power athletes such as throwers,
football players, volleyball players, and basketball players.

Brief Description
Clean: Place the bar on the floor in front of your shins. Keep your feet approximately two
feet apart. Grasp the bar with palms facing you and hands at shoulder width, and squat,
keeping  your  arms  and  back  straight  and  your  head  up.  Pull  the  weight  up  past  your
knees to your chest while throwing your hips forward and shoulders back. After pulling
the weight as high as you can, squat down suddenly and catch the bar on your chest at a
level just above your collarbones. Stand up straight with the bar at chest level, with feet
shoulder width apart. The main power for this exercise should come from your hips and
legs. Think of the middle phase of the lift as a vertical jump —this makes you drive up the
weight with your legs, rather than your arms.

Jerk: Holding the bar high on your chest, bend your knees and then extend fully, driving
the  bar  upward.  Drop  underneath  the  bar,  while  driving  your  bent  right  leg  forward
and  your  straight  left  leg  backwards.  Holding  the  bar  overhead  with  arms  extended,
stand with feet shoulder width apart. Return the bar to the floor. See the Clean and Jerk
Evaluation Checklist on page 189.

Youth FitnessPower and Speed  |  189

 ❑ At this point, your toes should be fully extended
and your shoulders fully shrugged. Keep your
arms straight and the barbell close to your body.

 ❑ Rack and Recovery

 ❑ With your body fully extended (ankles, knees,

hips with spine straight and shoulder shrugged),
bend your arms (upright row posture) and begin
to drop under the rising barbell by rotating the
elbows out in front and dropping to a full squat.
Your feet may have to widen slightly at this point
so that you assume a secure, balanced position.

 ❑ As the hips go below the knees, the barbell should

come to rest on your deltoids and clavicles.

 ❑ As you ride the weight down to a front squat
position, you have reached the clean catch
position.

 ❑ Stand up, keeping the elbows up, the torso rigid,

and the chest high, and hold the barbell tightly
across the deltoids.

 ❑ From this position, bring the feet back to the

starting stance.

 ❑ Bend your knees, lowering your body about three
to five inches. Straighten your legs explosively,
driving the barbell up from the shoulders with
your arms, while pushing upward on your toes.

 ❑ As the barbell passes above your head, push

your toes forcefully off of the floor and drive one
leg forward about one foot and the other foot
backward in the opposite direction about two to
three feet (in a “lunge” position).

 ❑ As your feet land, lockout the barbell overhead

with your arms. This is the split jerk catch position.

 ❑ Return to the standing erect position by pushing
back with the front foot and stepping up with
the rear foot, pushing up hard to keep the barbell
overhead.

 ❑ The finish position of the clean and jerk is when

the barbell is locked out overhead with the feet in
line, and the body held in an erect position.

 ❑ Lower the bar under control back to the floor.

Clean and Jerk Evaluation Check List

The Starting Position

 ❑ Load the barbell correctly with the appropriate
weight and with the safety collars in place to
secure the plates.

 ❑ Stand with feet spaced hip to shoulders width
apart, with toes directly under the bar slightly
pointed out, with no stagger, feet flat on floor,
knees straight, and the barbell two inches from
the shins.

 ❑ Reach down for the barbell using a hook grip.

Grip the barbell as tightly as possible when using
heavier weights. Once you have the proper grip,
bend the knees so the bar is close to the shins.

 ❑ Keep your back flat, head up, chest out, shoulder
blades pulled together, trapezius muscles relaxed,
and arms straight with forearms pronated. Keep
your hips higher than the knees but lower than
your shoulders, with the barbell now touching
the shins.

The First Pull

 ❑ Tighten the torso muscles, and pull the bar off of

the floor with a smooth, slow, easy pull.

 ❑ Keep the hips higher than the knees but lower

than the shoulders, maintaining a flat back with
the shoulders still over the barbell.

 ❑ Keep elbows locked with arms extended and

forearms pronated.

 ❑ Keep your head in a neutral position with your

eyes focusing straight ahead (do not look at the
ceiling) and maintain a flat back.

 ❑ Keep your feet flat on the floor, balancing at

mid-foot.

The Second Pull

 ❑ You have reached the major power position of
the lift—the starting point for the second pull—
when you have raised the bar to the level of your
kneecaps or slightly higher. At this point, pull the
bar upward quickly, keeping your arms straight
and the barbell close to your body.

 ❑ When the barbell reaches mid-thigh level, explode
upward using as much force as possible. Extend
up on your toes, shrug your shoulders upward,
and pull the barbell above your belly button—
keeping the barbell as close to the body as
possible.

The Squat Snatch
The snatch is more complex and difficult than the clean and
jerk. The object of the lift is to pull the bar over your head
in one movement and catch it overhead from a squat with
your arms straight. Good coaching is essential to mastering
this lift.

Brief Description
Place the bar on the floor in front of your shins, with your
feet approximately shoulder width apart. Grasp the bar with
palms  facing  you,  hands  placed  as  wide  apart  as  possible,
and  squat,  keeping  your  arms  and  back  straight  and  your
head up. Pull the weight up past your knees to your chest
while  throwing  your  hips  upward  and  shrugging  your
shoulders. After pulling the weight as high as you can, go
into  a  squat  and  catch  the  bar  overhead  with  your  arms
straight. Stand up straight with the bar overhead. Return the
bar to the starting position. See the Squat Snatch Evaluation
Checklist on page 191.

modIFIed olYmPIc lIFTS
This section describes the power clean, jerk, and the power
snatch—modifications of the exercises done by competitive
weight lifters. The squat clean and squat snatch take years
to  perfect.  For  most  young  athletes,  the  goal  of  explosive
whole body training is to increase strength and power for
their  sport.  Performing  modifications  of  the  complete  lift
requires  less  precise  technique  and  builds  high  levels  of
strength more quickly.

Squat Snatch

The Split Snatch
The  split  and  squat  snatches  are  similar  except  that  you
catch the bar in a lunge position in the split snatch. As with
the squat snatch, the object of the lift is to pull the bar over
your head in one movement and catch it overhead from a
squat  with  your  arms  straight.  While  the  split  technique
is  rarely  used  in  weight  lifting  competitions,  it  is  a  good
training  exercise  for  athletes  who  require  vigorous  weight
transfers,  such  as  baseball  or  softball  players,  discus  or
javelin throwers, or shot putters.

Power Clean

Power Clean
This  excellent  exercise  develops  power  in  the  muscles

Power and Speed  |  193

Directions: Place the bar on the floor in front of your shins.
Keep your feet approximately two feet apart. Grasp the bar
with palms facing you, hands at shoulder width, and squat,
keeping your arms and back straight and head up. Pull the
weight up past your knees to your chest while throwing your
hips forward and shoulders back. After pulling the weight as
high as you can, bend the knees suddenly and catch the bar
on your chest at a level just above your collarbones. Stand
up straight with the bar at chest level. Return the bar to the
starting position. The main power for this exercise should
come from your hips and legs. Think of the middle phase of
the lift as a vertical jump—this makes you propel the weight
up with your legs rather than your arms.

Variations: Variations include the high pull and squat clean.
The high pull is identical to the power clean except you do
not turn the bar over at the top of the lift and catch it at your
chest. This permits handling more weight with less stress on
wrists and forearms.

The squat clean is a technically more difficult lift than the
power clean. At the top of the pulling phase of the clean, bend
your knees fully and catch the weight at your chest while in
a full squat position. When you master this movement, you
will be able to clean more weight than you can power clean
because you do not have to pull the weight as high.

Power Snatch
The  power  snatch  is  more  complex  and  difficult  than  the
power clean. The objective is to pull the bar over your head
in one movement and catch it overhead with arms straight.
Good coaching is essential to mastering this lift.

Directions: Place the bar on the floor in front of your shins.
Keep  your  feet  approximately  two  feet  apart.  Grasp  the
bar  with  palms  facing  you,  hands  placed  as  wide  apart  as
possible,  and  squat,  keeping  your  arms  and  back  straight
and  your  head  up.  Pull  the  weight  up  past  your  knees  to
your chest while throwing your hips forward and shoulders
back.  After  pulling  the  weight  as  high  as  you  can,  bend
the  knees  suddenly  and  catch  it  overhead  with  your  arms
straight. Stand up straight with the bar overhead. Return the
bar to the starting position.

Jerk

Directions:  Begin  the  exercise  with  the  bar  at  the  top  of
the  clean  position,  resting  on  your  chest  approximately  at
the level of your collarbones. Take the bar to this position
by doing a clean or taking the bar from a rack and placing
it  at  a  chest-high  level  (performed  this  way,  the  exercise
is  called  “jerks  off  the  rack”).  Bend  your  knees,  and  then
thrust the bar up vigorously using your legs and arms. Drop
underneath the bar with a split movement, one leg forward
with bent knee, and the other leg extended straight to the
back. Then, bring your feet together so you are in a standing
position with the bar overhead and in control.

Other Exercises to Develop
Speed and Power
Variations  of  plyometric  exercises  are  limited  only  by
imagination. Obviously you cannot include all the exercises
presented here in your exercise program. Choose the ones
whose  movements  most  closely  resemble  your  favorite
sports.  In  general,  choose  about  6  to  12  speed  and  power
exercises, and integrate them into a program that includes
cardiovascular,  strength,  and  flexibility  exercises.  Sample
exercise routines and exercise programming are discussed
in a later section of the course.

Jerk
To the novice, the jerk looks very much like a shoulder or
military  press  described  in  the  weight  training  section  of
the  course.  Actually,  the  jerk  is  mainly  a  leg  exercise.  You
hoist the bar overhead by driving with your legs and then
dropping underneath the bar.

Remember,  the  power  the  athlete  develops  from  these
exercises does not transfer automatically to increased power
in  the  sport.  One  has  to  practice  the  skill  and  gradually
integrate the increased power into purposeful movements.
If  athletes  work  consistently  on  sports  skills  and  perform
exercises to increase strength and power, they will eventually
become more powerful in their sport.

International Sports Sciences Association194  |  unit 13

SuMMARY

Young children can build strength and power through training to help them
perform better in sport. Power in sports depends on genetics, metabolic capacity,
muscle size, skill, and nervous system capacity. Effective strength (usable strength
in the sport) is determined by how well the nervous system controls the muscles
and by the skill and efficiency of movement. Athletes in any skilled sport must direct
most of their energies toward developing skill. Practicing the skill must never take a
back seat to general physical conditioning.

Weight training, speed, and plyometric training eventually produce more powerful
movements if integrated into a long-term, systematic program that includes skill
training and physical conditioning.

Exercises to develop power and speed include sprint starts, sprinting, harness sprint-
ing, hurdles, stair running, high knee-fast arms, speed ladders, speed lifting, peak
power training on a stationary bike, whole body functional training, and Olympic
weight lifting.

# Assessing Fitness In Children

196  |  unit 14

Personal  trainers  should  assess  their  young  clients’  fitness
for  comparison  to  established  norms  to  assess  readiness
for  competition,  identify  weaknesses,  and  assess  progress.
Literally hundreds of fitness tests exist to assess endurance,
strength, flexibility, power, speed, agility, and skill. Select the
most  appropriate  tests  that  provide  information  about  the
athlete’s current status and progress. This section discusses
basic  fitness  tests  for  children.  Advanced  athletes  may
require more sophisticated testing.

A major theme throughout this course is that motor skills
(and  tests)  are  highly  specific.  This  means  that  a  young
football, soccer, or field hockey player who performs well on
endurance, sprint, and strength tests will not necessarily be
the best athlete in the sport. Choose tests that have validity—

the tasks in the test should closely reflect the requirements
of  the  sport.  For  example,  a  15-minute  endurance  test  on
the  track  does  not  measure  the  physical  requirements  to
successfully  throw  a  discus,  shoot  free  throws,  spike  a
volleyball,  perform  a  handstand,  or  swing  a  golf  club.  Be
sport or skill specific as much as possible.

Consider  safety  and  injury  prevention  when  testing.
Maximum strength or speed tests may increase the risk of
injury.  Make  sure  children  are  warmed  up  and  physically
prepared to take the tests.

This unit describes simple tests for measuring fitness. You
don’t need expensive equipment to do these tests. Most of
them are valid and have been used by coaches for decades.

ThE PRESIDENT’S ChALLENgE:
PhYSICAL ACTIvITY AND FITNESS PROgRAM
The President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports has a
series of fitness tests that can serve as a great starting point
for  measuring  strength,  power,  endurance,  and  flexibility.
These  tests  are  valuable  for  assessing  fitness  in  children
because they include extensive norms for boys and girls ages
6  to  18  years. The  tests  involve  five  parts:  (1)  curl-ups  or
partial  curl-ups,  (2)  the  shuttle  run,  (3)  an  endurance
run/walk, (4) pull-ups, right-angle push-ups, or bent
arm hang, and (5) the v-sit reach or sit and reach. The
norms  are  included  within  this  chapter.  The  President’s
Counsel  offers  awards  for  achieving  minimal  fitness
standards. The Council describes the tests as follows:

or

to the chest. Keeping this arm position, the athlete raises the
trunk curling up to touch elbows to thighs and then lowers
the back to the floor so that the scapulas (shoulder blades)
touch  the  floor  for  one  curl-up.  To  start,  a  timer  calls  out
the signal “Ready? Go!” and begins timing athlete for one
minute. The athlete stops on the word “stop.”

Curl-ups  Scoring:  “Bouncing”  off  the  floor  is  not
permitted. Keep the arms and elbows held close to the chest.
The curl-up should be counted only if performed correctly.

knees, then back down until the head touches the partner’s
hands.  The  curl-ups  are  done  to  a  metronome  (or  audio
tape,  clapping,  drums)  with  one  complete  curl-up  every
three seconds, and are continued until the athlete can do no
more in rhythm (has not done the last three in rhythm) or
has reached the target number for the Presidential Physical
Fitness Award (50th or 85th percentile for the fitness tests).

Partial  Curl-ups  Scoring:  Record  only  those  curl-ups
done with proper form and in rhythm.

Partial  Curl-ups  Rationale:  Partial  (abdominal)  curl-
ups, done slowly with knees bent and feet not held, replace
the timed curl-ups because they are a better indicator of the
strength and endurance of the abdominal muscles.

(2) Shuttle Run

(3) Mile Run/Walk Test

Objective: To measure heart/lung endurance by the fastest
time to cover a one-mile distance.

Procedure:  On  a  safe,  one-mile  distance,  athletes  begin
running  on  the  count  “Ready?  Go!”  Walking  may  be
interspersed  with  running.  However,  the  athletes  should
be  encouraged  to  cover  the  distance  in  as  short  a  time  as
possible.

Scoring:  Before  administering  this  test,  athletes’  health
status  should  be  reviewed.  Also,  athletes  should  be  given
ample instruction on proper pacing and should be allowed
to  practice  running  this  distance  against  time.  Sufficient
time  should  be  used  for  warming  up  and  cooling  down
before  and  after  the  test.  Times  are  recorded  in  minutes
and seconds.

Objective: To perform the shuttle run as fast as possible.

Options:

Procedure: Mark two parallel lines 30 feet apart and place
two blocks of wood or similar object behind one of the lines.
Athletes start behind opposite line. On the signal “Ready?
Go!” the athlete runs to the blocks, picks one up, runs back
to  the  starting  line,  places  the  block  behind  the  line,  runs
back  and  picks  up  the  second  block  and  runs  back  across
starting line.

Scoring:  Blocks  should  not  be  thrown  across  the  lines.
Scores are recorded to the nearest tenth of a second.

•  Option for 6 to 7 years old: 400-meter run

•  Option for 8 to 9 years old: 800-meter run

The same objective and testing procedures are used as with
the mile run.

Rationale:  Shorter  distance  runs  are  included  as  options
for younger children. Younger children can be prepared to
run the mile; however, it is sometimes easier to administer

Meter-Yard Conversions: If you are not using a track that
is measured in miles, then convert the distance from metric
measurements.  Use  the  following  chart  for  converting  to
miles when using a 400-meter or 440-yard track.

(4) Upper body strength: pull-ups,
push-ups, or bent arm hangs
choose one for this test area

Pull-ups  Objective:  To  measure  upper  body  strength/
endurance by the maximum number of pull-ups completed.

extended and feet free from floor, using either an overhand
grasp  (palms  facing  away  from  the  body)  or  underhand
grip  (palms  facing  toward  the  body).  Small  athletes  may
be lifted to starting position. Athlete raises  the body  until
the  chin  clears  the  bar  and  then  lowers  body  to  full-hang
starting position. Athlete performs as many correct pull-ups
as possible.

Pull-ups  Scoring:  Pull-ups  should  be  done  in  a  smooth,
fluid motion rather than a jerky motion. Kicking or bending
the  legs  is  not  permitted  and  the  body  must  not  swing
during the movement.

or
Push-ups  Objective:  To  measure  upper  body  strength/
endurance according to the maximum number of push-ups
completed.

Push-ups  Procedure:  The  athlete  lies  face  down  on  the
mat  in  push-up  position  with  hands  under  shoulders,
fingers straight, and legs straight, parallel, and slightly apart,
with  the  toes  supporting  the  feet.  The  athlete  straightens
the arms, keeping the back and knees straight, then lowers
the body until there is a 90-degree angle at the elbows, with
the upper arms parallel to the floor. A partner holds her/his
hand at the point of the 90-degree angle so that the athlete
tested  goes  down  only  until  her/his  shoulder  touches  the
partner’s  hand,  then  back  up.  The  push-ups  are  done  to
a  metronome  (or  audio  tape,  clapping,  drums)  with  one
complete  push-up every  three seconds, and are  continued
until the athlete can do no more in rhythm (has not done
the last three in rhythm).

Push-ups Scoring: Record only those push-ups done with
proper form and in rhythm.

angle  push-ups

Push-ups  Rationale:  Right
are
recommended  for  upper  body  strength  and  endurance
testing  because  the  athletes’  body  weight  has  less  effect
than  it  does  on  pull-ups.  Right  angle  push-ups  provide  a
better  indicator  of  the  range  of  strength/endurance  found
in children and youth, whereas many are unable to do any
pull-ups.  Pull-ups  remain  an  option  for  those  athletes  at
higher levels of strength/endurance.

or
Flexed-Arm hang

Athletes  who  cannot  do  one  pull-up  may  do  the  flexed-
arm hang to qualify for the National or Participant Physical
Fitness  Awards.  To  qualify  for  the  Presidential  Award,
athletes are required to do pull-ups or right angle push-ups.

Pull-ups  Procedure:  Athlete  hangs  from  a  horizontal
bar  at  a  height  the  athlete  can  hang  from  with  arms  fully

Flexed-Arm  hang  Objective:  To  maintain  the  flexed-
arm hang position as long as possible.

Flexed-Arm hang Procedure:

Use  either  an  overhand  grip  (palms  facing  away  from  the
body)  or  underhand  grip  (palms  facing  toward  body),
the  athlete  assumes  a  flexed-arm  hang  position  with  chin
clearing the bar. Athletes may be lifted to this position. The
athlete holds this position as long as possible.

Flexed-Arm hang Scoring:

Chest should be held close to bar with legs hanging straight.
Timing  is  stopped  when  the  athlete’s  chin  touches  or  falls
below the bar.

(5) Flexibility test:
V-Sit Reach or Sit and Reach

on floor with measuring line between legs and soles of feet
placed  immediately  behind  baseline,  heels  8  to  12  inches
apart. The athlete clasps his/her thumbs so that the hands
are  together,  palms  down  and  then  places  them  on  the
measuring line. With the legs held flat by a partner, athlete
slowly reaches forward as far as possible, keeping fingers on
baseline and feet flexed. After three practice tries, the athlete
holds the fourth reach for three seconds while that distance
is recorded.

v-Sit  Reach  Rules:  Legs  must  remain  straight  with  the
soles of the feet held perpendicular to the floor (feet flexed).
Athletes should be encouraged to reach slowly rather than
“bounce”  while  stretching.  Scores,  recorded  to  the  nearest
half inch, are read as plus scores for reaches beyond baseline
and minus scores for reaches behind baseline.

v-Sit Reach Objective: To measure flexibility of the lower
back and hamstrings by reaching forward in the V position.

or

v-Sit  Reach  Procedure:  A  straight  line  two  feet  long
is  marked  on  the  floor  as  the  baseline.  A  measuring  line
is  drawn  perpendicular  to  the  midpoint  of  the  baseline
extending  two  feet  on  each  side  and  marked  off  in  half-
inches.  The  point  where  the  baseline  and  measuring  line
intersect  is  the  “0”  point.  Athlete  removes  shoes  and  sits

Sit and Reach Objective: Farthest distance reached.

Sit and Reach Procedure: A specially constructed box is
placed,  with  a  measuring  scale  marked  in  centimeters  (23
centimeters  at  the  level  of  the  feet).  Athletes  remove  their
shoes and sit on floor with knees extended fully, feet shoulder
width apart and soles of the feet held flat against the end of

the box. With hands on top of each other, palms down, and
legs held flat, the athletes reach along the measuring line as
far as possible. After three practice reaches, the fourth reach
is held while the distance is recorded.

Sit  and  Reach  Rules:  The  legs  must  remain  straight,
with  the  soles  of  feet  against  box  and  fingertips  of  both
hands reaching evenly along the measuring line. Scores are
recorded to the nearest centimeter.

MEASuRINg
ENDuRANCE FITNESS
For most people, it is unnecessary to administer complicated,
expensive laboratory exercise tests. You can assess endurance
fitness  using  simple  field  tests.  These  include  the  1-mile
walking test, the Cooper 12-minute run, the 6-mile bicycle
test, and the Cooper 12-minute swim test. Use these tests to
assess starting fitness and measure progress in the program.
Choose  a  test  that  reflects  the  nature  of  the  athlete’s  sport
or  exercise  program.  For  example,  swimmers  should  take
the  swimming  test  rather  than  the  running  or  walking
test. Runners should take the running test rather than the
swimming test.

Maximal  oxygen  consumption  (called

VO2max  measures  the  ability  to  deliver  and  use  oxygen.  It
also  measures  the  capacity  to  exercise  at  high  intensities.
in  sophisticated  exercise
Scientists  measure
science labs using expensive treadmills, gas analyzers, and
computers.  The  exercise  intensity  increases  periodically
during the test until the test subject fatigues and continues
no  further.  Each  minute,  the  test  administrator  measures
and records oxygen uptake, heart rate, blood pressure, the
electrocardiogram,  and  breathing  rate  and  volume.  The
highest level of oxygen consumption during the test is called
maximal oxygen consumption.

VO2max

During  the  test,  the  electrical  activity  of  the  heart  is  also
measured  (with  the  electrocardiogram).  This  helps  the
physician assess heart function during exercise. Physicians
will  sometimes  perform  an  exercise  electrocardiogram  to
assess the health of the heart or to determine if a patient can
safely participate in an exercise program. Such assessments
are not common in children unless the physician suspects
underlying cardiovascular disease.

Youth Fitness
Assessing Fitness in Children  |  205

FIeld TeSTS For meaSurIng endurance
You  can  estimate  fitness  for  walking,  running,  swimming,
and biking with simple field tests. If your client is starting
an  exercise  program,  use  the  walking  test.  Experienced,
fit  athletes  should  take  one  of  the  other,  more  rigorous
field tests. Choose the test that most closely fits the client’s
favorite  type  of  exercise.  This  is  important;  performance
on the running field test will tell you little about fitness for
swimming.

Most children do not need medical clearance before taking
maximum fitness tests. A physician should be consulted if
children:

•  have heart trouble

•

suffer from chest pain

•  have dizzy spells

•  have high blood pressure

•  have bone or joint problems

1-Mile Rockport Walking Test
The  Rockport  walking  test  estimates  maximal  oxygen
consumption. Take this test on a 400-meter track (440-yards).
Walk 1-mile (4 laps) as quickly as possible without running.
This  test  does  not  require  special  equipment  and  can  be
performed with large groups; it is only marginally accurate
in  children  but  still  a  good  starting  place  for  assessing
endurance  fitness.  Five  variables  are  needed  to  estimate
.
VO2max:
Record the following and enter it into the equation below:

1.  Age in years

2.  Sex (females are coded as 0 and males as 1)

3.  Time to complete the one-mile walk (in minutes

including a decimal), and weight (lb)

4.  Heart rate (in beats per minute) measured for 10

seconds immediately after completing the walk

5.  Multiply the answer by 6 to obtain the one-

minute heart rate.

This is a good fitness test for a person beginning an exercise
program. The best place to take this test is on a 400-meter
track (440 yards). If you do not have access to one, use a car
odometer to mark off a course on smooth, flat ground.

Begin with warm-up exercises, such as simple stretches and
walking  in  place.  Walk  the  mile  as  fast  as  possible.  Use  a
stopwatch  to  time  the  walk  to  the  nearest  second.  This  is
a walking test, so the walker always must have one foot in
contact with the ground. If both feet leave the ground at any
time during the movement, the child is running and must
return to a walk.

exercise  program,  and  do  exercise  that  involves  running
(e.g., jogging, tennis, basketball, or volleyball).

Take this test on a 400-meter running track (use Table 14.5
to convert to and from meters.) You will need a stopwatch
or  clock  with  a  second  hand.  Warm  up  with  easy  jogging
and stretching exercises. The object of the test is to run as
far  as  possible  in  12  minutes.  Record  distance  traveled  in
meters  using  a  decimal  figure.  For  example,  if  the  person
ran  exactly  six  laps  on  a  440-yard  track,  he  or  she  would
have covered 2414 meters. Check the young athlete’s fitness
rating in Table 14.12.

Cooper 12-Minute Run
This is one of the most popular field tests for assessing fitness
and is used by millions of people of all ages. Youth should
take this test if they are healthy, already participating in an

Six-Mile Bicycle Test
The six-mile bicycle test is appropriate if the person has been
riding a bike regularly for at least three to four weeks. Take
this test on the same bicycle in the exercise program. Bicycle

test performance. However, regardless of the bicycle used,
the test is good for approximating cycling fitness and useful
for identifying the starting point of the program.

Use  a  flat,  six-mile  course  void  of  interference  from
automobiles or other bicycles. A bike track is preferred. A
road with a bike lane or a park that does not allow cars is
excellent  for  taking  the  test.  Before  the  test,  warm  up  by
riding at a relatively slow pace for 4 to 10 minutes. Ride the
six-mile course as fast as possible (and safely). Assess fitness
by comparison to the norms in Table 14.13.

The 12-minute Swim Test
Use this test if swimming is a planned part of the exercise
program.  You  will  need  a  swimming  pool  and  stopwatch.
Before  taking  the  test,  have  the  athlete  warm-up  by
swimming two laps. The object is to swim as far as possible
in 12 minutes at a steady pace. Check rating in Table 14.14.

Step Test
This  test  requires  little  equipment.  You  will  need  a  12-
inch  bench  step  (with  at  least  a  24”  x  16”  stepping  area),
a  clock  with  a  sweep  hand  (seconds)  or  a  stopwatch,  and
a metronome. Set the metronome to 96 beats per minute.
Stepping cadence (96 bpm) is 24 steps per minute.

The  rhythm  of  the  steps  will  be  a  4  count:  up,  up,  down,
down.  Step  up  with  the  right  foot,  then  left  ,  followed  by
right  foot  down  then  left  foot  down.  Demonstrate  the
pattern to your client.

Allow 15 seconds of practice with
the  metronome.  Begin  the  test;
time  client  for  three  minutes.
After  three  minutes,  terminate
the  test  and  have  the  client  sit
down.  Five  seconds  after  the
3-minute  termination  mark,  take
the client’s pulse for one complete
minute.  Record  this  one-minute
post  exercise  rate.  Compare  to

the  norms  on  Table  14.15.  Please  note:  these  rates  are  for
adults. You will want to establish your own norms based on
a sampling of youth athletes from both sexes.

MEASuRINg FOR POWER

Power Quadrathlon
The quadrathlon was originally developed by British track
and field coach Max Jones to measure power in throwers.
However,  the  test  is  great  for  any  power  athlete.  Use  it  to
assess  fitness  and  gauge  progress  in  the  training  program.
The quadrathlon includes standing long jump, three jumps,
30-meter sprint, and overhead shot throw. (Table 14.17)

Standing Long Jump
Place  both  feet  over  the  edge  of  the  long-jump  pit  or  use
a  gym  floor.  The  athlete  starts  in  a  static  position,  with
feet  together,  shoulder  width  apart.  He  or  she  crouches,
leans  forward,  swings  the  arms  backwards,  then  jumps
horizontally  forward  as  far  as  possible,  landing  with  both
feet  into  the  jumping  area.  Measure  from  the  edge  of  the
take-off point to the nearest point of contact.

Three Jumps (Bunny Hops)
Do  this  test  on  a  track,  football  field,  or  gym  floor.  Start
with both feet comfortably apart with the toes just behind
the  take-off  mark.  The  athlete  takes  three  continuous  two
footed jumps. Measure the distance covered. The start must
be from a static position and both feet must be parallel on
each jump phase. Athletes may wear spikes.

30-Meter Sprint
The athlete begins in a crouched position on the track. Give
the command “on your marks, set, go.” On “go”, the athlete
sprints from a stationary set position as fast as possible to
the finish line. Stand at the finish line and time the run from
the  moment  the  runner  contacts  the  ground  on  the  first
stride  to  the  moment  when  the  runner’s  torso  crosses  the
line. Spikes are allowed.

Overhead Shot Throw
Use  the  appropriate  weight  for  the  age  and  gender  of  the
athlete—girls and women use an 8 lb shot, high school boys
use a 12 lb shot, and college men use a 16 lb shot. The athlete
stands on top of the shot toe-board, facing away from the
landing  area,  with  feet  a  comfortable  distance  apart.  The
shot  is  held  cupped  in  both  hands.  The  athlete  crouches,
lowering the shot between the legs, then drives upwards to
propel the shot back over the head. The athlete must land
feet-first and remain upright or the throw counts as a foul.

Measurement is taken from the inside of the toe-board to
the nearest point of contact.

Scoring:  Use  the  quadrathlon  scoring  table  (Table  14.17)
to  compare  athletes  or  gauge  progress  in  a  single  athlete.
This  test  is  a  good  measure  of  general  power  and  should
be  administered  monthly  during  the  off-season.  The
athlete should take the test during the season if there is any
question concerning training status. Calculate points using
Table 14.16.

Vertical Jump Test

Vertical Jump Test
The vertical jump test is a favorite for measuring explosive
leg power. Ideally, use a vertical jump device, such as a Vertec
or Vertical Jump Mat. If none is available, tack a tape on the
wall—high and low enough to assess the athletes’ standing
reach and jump reach. The athlete applies chalk to the end of
the fingertips and stands sideways to the wall. Keeping both
feet on the ground, he or she reaches as high as possible with
one hand and makes a mark on the wall. This is the baseline

measurement. With feet still in a static position, he or she
flexes the knees and then jumps as high as possible, making
a mark at the highest point in the jump. The athlete’s score is
the highest of three trials. (Table 14.18).

The results of this test relate to performance in many power
sports. Repeat this test often.

Chest Throws
Chest Throws (Medicind Ball Chest Pass) is a good measure
of  upper  body  explosiveness.  The  test  is  moderately
correlated to bench press strength. No norms are available,
so  measure  performance  over  time  to  assess  changes
in  upper  body  power.  This  test  requires  a  medicine  ball
weighing approximately 2 percent of body weight.

Directions:  For  standing  chest  throws,  stand  with  legs
spread  approximately  shoulder  width  apart.  Hold  the
medicine ball with both hands at chest level as if performing
a  basketball  chest  pass.  Throw  the  medicine  ball  as  far  as
possible  straight  forward  using  a  two-handed  chest  pass.
Measure the distance between a starting line and the landing
site (closest to the starting line).

Overhead Medicine
Ball throw
This test uses a movement similar to that used during weight
lifting exercise such as the snatch and clean. No norms are
available,  so  measure  performance  changes  over  time  to
assess  changes  in  upper  body  power.  This  test  requires  a
medicine ball weighing approximately 5 percent of the users
body weight.

Directions:  Stand  behind  a  line  with  the  back  facing  the
direction  of  the  throw.  Hold  the  ball  with  both  hands
below  the  waist  with  arms  straight,  and  knees  and  hips
flexed slightly. Pull the ball quickly overhead using power
generated  from  the  lower  body  and  do  not  cross  the  foul
line. Measure the distance between a starting line and the
landing site (closest to the starting line).

Sprint tests

10- and 40-yard (or meter) dashes
Short  sprint  tests  are  important  evaluation  tools  for  high-
power sports such as football, basketball, soccer, volleyball,
and track and field. These tests are so important that some
coaches  use  them  as  screening  tools  to  weed  out  athletes
who do not achieve minimums for basic power. Administer
these  tests  regularly  to  conditioned  athletes  to  avoid
injury. Norms are available for the 40-yard dash (hand and
electronic timing), but reliable norms are not available for
the  10-yard  dash  for  high  school,  junior  high  school,  or
elementary school athletes. If you use the 10-yard dash test,
track progress with repeated tests.

Directions:  Use  a  standing,  crouch,  or  block  start.  The
starting cadence is “on your marks; set; go.” Athletes should
complete the distance as quickly as possible. Use either hand
or electronic timing.

20-Meter Start from Blocks
Sprinting from starting blocks is a great way to develop and
measure  explosive  power.  Sprinting  from  blocks  is  a  skill
that  requires  instruction  and  practice.  Reliable  norms  are
not available for the 20-meter start from blocks for young
athletes. If you want to use the 20-meter start from blocks
test, measure changes in speed with repeated tests.

Directions: The test involves a sequence of “on your marks,
set, and go.”

“On your marks position”: The feet are staggered 10 to 14
inches  apart,  with  the  front  foot  placed  approximately  20
inches from the starting line. Try to relax in this position.

“Set position”: Raise the back and hips. The front leg bends
about  90°  and  the  rear  leg  120°.  Right-handed  people
generally start with their left foot forward. The back is flat,
and  the  hips  are  slightly  higher  than  the  shoulders.  The
athletes  contact  the  ground  with  their  fingertips,  which
raises the shoulders as high as possible. They should not put
too much weight on the fingertips.

“Go”: Raise the shoulders so that they can direct force with
the front driving leg through the length of the body. Drive
the front leg fully so that the body forms a straight line from
the hip to the heels. Push the rear foot hard against the block
or ground as they drive their knee forward. As they drive
forward, the arm on the side of the front foot drives straight
forward, while the rear foot arm drives straight backward.
Both arms are bent approximately 90 to 110°. Try to extend
fully with the hips and knees and use the arms dynamically
during the driving phases of the movement. After the start,
run as fast as possible toward the 20-meter line.

100-, 200-, and 400-Meter Dashes
These  are  reliable  tests  of  fitness  and  power  output  for
young  athletes.  Reliable  norms  are  not  available  for  these
tests  for  high  school,  junior  high  school,  or  elementary
school  athletes.  If  you  use  these  tests,  track  progress  with
repeated tests.

Directions:  Use  a  standing,  crouch,  or  block  start.  The
starting cadence is “on your marks; set; go.” Run the distance
as quickly as possible.

MEASuRINg FOR
STRENgTh

Hand Grip Dynamometer
The handgrip dynamometer test is a measure of static grip
strength.  While  it  has  limited  applicability  to  athletics,  it
does provide a rough estimate of upper body strength. The
test is easy to administer, so norms are available for children
and adolescents. (See Tables 14.20 and 14.21)

Directions: Use a commercially available grip dynamometer
calibrated  in  kilograms  and  perform  the  test  using  the
dominant and non-dominant hand. Grasp the dynamometer
and hold it to the side with the arm extended fully and elbow
straight.  Athletes  should  grip  as  hard  as  you  can.  Perform
three  trials  and  use  the  middle  score.  The  grip  strength
norms show reflect data gathered on youth baseball players
and recreationally active younger children.

Bench Press
The bench press is a good measure of upper body strength.
The exercise is a favorite of high school and college athletes.
Do this test with free weights or a weight machine.

Directions: Warm-up by bench-pressing light weights. Lie
on the bench with your feet flat on the floor. Grasp the bar
slightly  more  than  shoulder  width  apart.  Have  the  spotter
help you move the bar from the rack to a point over your
chest.  Lower  the  bar  in  a  straight  line  slightly  below  your
nipples (end of the breast bone). Push the weight straight up
to the starting position. (See Table 14.22)

Youth FitnessPREDICTINg ONE-REPETITION MAxIMuM
(1-RM) FROM MuLTIPLE REPETITIONS
Many  personal  trainers  prefer  predicting  1-RM  from  multiple  repetitions  at  a  specific  weight. The  Brzycki  equation  has  been
validated  on  the  bench  press.  It  is  accurate  when  the  maximum  repetitions  are  10  or  fewer.  Some  high  school  programs  use
modifications of the NFL Combine bench press test that might involve performing 20 or more repetitions at a specific weight. The
NFL Combine uses 225 pounds, while high school programs typically use 135 pounds or less. High repetition strength tests are
better measures of muscle endurance than strength. The chart makes calculations unnecessary.

The Brzycki equation:  1-RM= Weight / ( 1.0278 - ( 0.0278 * Number of repetitions ) )  Weights are in kg. 1 kg=2.2 lb.

Squat
Do not do a maximum squat test until you have pre-screened
your  client  using  the  lower  body  assessment  skills  test  in
section 2.4. Before taking the maximum squat test, children
should demonstrate good form on the chair squat, step-up,
unloaded  squat,  and  one-leg  squat.  When  squatting,  they
should hinge at the hips and maintain a neutral spine during
the  exercise.  Norms  (percentile  ranks)  for  the  squat  test
were obtained from a sample of high school football players.

Directions: Warm-up for this test by performing squats at
submaximal  weights.  Use  experienced  spotters  during  the
test.  Position  one  spotter  behind  the  lifter  if  the  weight  is
light  and  use  three  spotters—one  behind  and  two  on  the
sides—if the weight is heavy or the lifter is doing a maximum
lift. The athlete may wear wraps and a belt. Place the bar on
the rack so that the athlete has to lift it a few inches to begin
the  lift.  The  athlete  should  stand  with  feet  approximately
shoulder width apart. They should squat until their hips are
lower then their knees (thighs below parallel).

Athletes should push out of the bottom position following
the same path that they used during the descent phase. They
should keep their torso and back erect and maintain their
hips under the bar throughout the pushing phase of the lift.
The spinal muscles should contract statically to maintain a
stable spine. After the lift, spotters should assist the athlete

in placing the bar on the rack. They should make sure that
the  lifter’s  hands  are  clear  of  the  supports  when  reracking
the weight. Spotters should be vigilant when assisting with
this exercise.

Overhead Press
The  overhead  press  (military  press)  is  a  good  exercise  if
athletes  use  good  form  and  do  not  overload  the  spine  or
shoulders. Reliable norms are not available for high school
athletes. If you want to use the overhead press test, measure
changes in strength with repeated tests.

Directions:  Grasp  barbell  from  rack  or  clean  the  barbell
from  floor.  Use  a  pronated  (overhand)  grip,  with  hands
placed  slightly  wider  than  shoulder  width  apart.  Position
the bar just above the collarbones. Press bar upward until
the  arms  are  extended  overhead.  Lower  to  the  bar  to  the
chest and then to the floor.

Dead Lift
The deadlift is an excellent measure of whole body strength.
It is highly related to the ability to sprint, jump, and throw.
However,  it  can  be  a  dangerous  test  for  untrained  young
athletes  who  do  the  lift  incorrectly.  The  exercise  involves
lifting a ‘dead’ weight from the floor to waist high. Athletes
should grip the barbell with a deadlift grip (one palm in, one
palm out), then lift the weight until they can stand upright
with the shoulders back, and then return the weight to the
starting position. This lift requires only a barbell and loaders.
A  leverage  bar  is  helpful  for  loading  and  unloading  large
plates. Reliable norms are not available for young athletes.
If  you  want  to  use  the  deadlift  test,  measure  changes  in
strength with repeated tests.

Leg Press
The  leg  press  is  the  most  common  and  perhaps  the  safest
way to measure leg strength in young athletes. Some experts
disagree.  The  exercise  requires  athletes  to  exert  maximal
force with the trunk in flexion, which puts excessive stress
on  the  spine.  In  addition,  the  available  norms  are  not
applicable to all leg press machines. The test is valuable for
gauging progress, particularly if leg presses are part of the
athlete’s training routine.

Directions:  Sit  or  lie  on  the  seat  or  bench,  depending  on
the  type  of  machine  and  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.
The  head,  back,  hips,  and  buttocks  should  be  pressed
against the machine pads. Loosely grasp the handles at the
side  of  the  machine.  Begin  with  your  feet  flat  on  the  foot
platform  about  shoulder  width  apart.  Extend  the  legs  but
do  not  forcefully  lock  the  knees.  Slowly  lower  the  weight
by  bending  the  knees  and  flexing  the  hips  until  the  knees
are  bent  at  about  a  90-degree  angle  or  the  heels  start  to
lift  off  the  foot  platform.  Keep  the  lower  back  flat  against
the support pad. Then extend the knees and return to the
starting position.

Power Clean
The power clean is a popular strength test for high-power
athletes,  such  as  American  football  players  and  throwers.
The lift requires considerable skill, and athletes should not
attempt it without proper instruction or experience. Norms
(percentile  ranks)  for  the  power  clean  test  were  obtained
from a sample of high school football players.

Directions:  Athletes  should  place  the  bar  on  the  floor  in
front  of  their  shins,  with  feet  spaced  approximately  two-
feet  apart. They  should  use  a  pronated  grip  and  grasp  the
bar  with  their  hands  spaced  shoulder  width  apart.  They
should  squat,  keeping  the  arms  and  back  straight  and  the
head neutral. From the starting position, they should pull
the weight up past the knees to the chest while the hips and
shoulders move upward. After pulling the weight as high as
they  can,  they  should  bend  the  knees  suddenly  and  catch
the  bar  on  the  upper  chest.  Then,  they  should  stand  up
straight with the bar at chest level. After completing the lift,
they should return the bar to the starting position. The main
power for this exercise should come from the hips and legs.

MAINTAININg A gOOD
MEASuREMENT
PROgRAM
Measurement  is  central  for  gauging  progress  in  young
athletes. All athletes should keep a daily training diary, where
they record their weight, resting heart rate, and workouts.
The  personal  trainer  should  also  maintain  a  log  of  test
performances. Tests will vary by sport and age. They might
include  anthropometric  measures  (weight,  height,  girths),
endurance  (running,  swimming,  or  cycling  field  tests),
anaerobic  tests  (200-400  meter  run),  body  composition
(skinfolds or girths), flexibility (range of motion of specific
joints),  power  (power  quadrathlon,  Olympic  lifts,  vertical
jump, standing long jump), muscular strength (1-RM, grip
strength), muscular endurance (push-ups, pull-ups, lifting
endurance), speed (sprints), and agility (shuttle run).

Measure anthropometric measures frequently—at least once
a week. Perform more dynamic and exhausting tests every
four  to  six  weeks.  Make  measurement  an  important  part
of your program. It gives athletes and parents an objective
measure of progress and helps you gauge the effectiveness
of the workouts.

about five or six tests and administer them often. Remember
the principle of specificity of training. Performance on the
squat, vertical jump, 12-minute run, or bench press is not
the same as playing the sport. However, performance tests
provide information on fitness and the effectiveness of the
conditioning program.

Measurement Frequency
Measuring  fitness  in  athletes  is  as  much  art  as  science.
Excessive  measurement  can  lead  to  burnout  and  injury.
Infrequent  measurement  can  result  in  lack  of  progress
and ignorance about the effectiveness of the program. This

gENETIC TESTINg IN ChILDREN
Gene variants called polymorphisms can give children a genetic advantage in physical
traits such as body composition, temperature regulation, speed, power, endurance, and
cardiorespiratory capacity and regulation. Several companies offer genetic screening to
identify traits that might provide an advantage in specific sports.

Are these tests valuable? While they are interesting, there are no genetic tests that will
identify a future Olympic champion in any sport. Excellence requires genetic advantage,
but personal ambition and drive, practice, good coaching, economics, and opportunity
are even more important. Children naturally gravitate toward activities that they enjoy
and  in  which  they  excel.  The  best  approach  is  to  give  kids  a  chance  to  play  a  variety
of  sports  and  see  which  they  like  best.  Parents  and  trainers  can  push  kids  in  specific
directions, but kids will never achieve elite levels without intrinsic motivation.

SuMMARY

Personal trainers should assess their young clients’ fitness for comparison to estab-
lished norms to assess readiness for competition, to identify weaknesses, and to
assess progress. Literally hundreds of fitness tests exist to assess endurance, strength,
flexibility, power, speed, agility, and skill. Motor skills (and tests) are highly specific.
Young football, soccer, and field hockey players who perform well on endurance,
sprint, and strength tests will not necessarily be the best athletes in the sport. Sur-
prisingly, few physical fitness test norms exist for young athletes. However, national
norms established as part of the President’s Challenge provided information about
the relative fitness of a child. Also, strength, power, speed, and endurance tests for
specific athletic populations can help identify athletic talent and changes in physical
condition as a result of training. Laboratory tests, such as maximal oxygen con-
sumption, BodPod, and isokinetic dynamometry can provide precise evaluations of
fitness. However, more simple tests—such as sprints, pull-ups, the vertical jump, the
1.5 mile run, the standing long jump, and medicine ball throws for distance—pro-
vide just as much information as more sophisticated tests.

# Structuring The Program

220  |  unit 15

Planning an effective exercise training program is as much
art  as  science.  Consider  the  athlete’s  age,  goals,  skills,
strengths  and  weaknesses,  likes  and  dislikes,  and  motiva-
tion.  Equipment  and  facilities  are  important—clients  will
not be able to swim if they do not have access to a pool or do
Olympic weight lifts if they cannot use free weights. When
designing a program, consider what is possible and what ex-
ercises the athlete will actually do. A scientifically sophisti-
cated training program is worthless if the athlete never goes
to the gym or will not cooperate.

Young  people  can  make  gains  on  almost  any  training
program.  At  least  in  boys,  physical  capacity,  strength,  and
power improve during growth without training. The impor-
tant thing is to stick with it. Plan a realistic, fun program,
and do it consistently. There is no single “correct” training
program. Young athletes can gain considerable strength and
power  with  minimal  equipment.  Children  can  use  body
weight  as  resistance  or  gain  strength  doing  exercises  with
rocks, ropes, and elastic bands. Encourage athletes to learn
all they can about training from magazines, coaches, clinics,
and the personal trainer (you). Plan a program, try it, evalu-
ate it and then modify it. Soon, you will have a program that
works for your client. (Table 15.1)

DEvELOPMENTALLY
APPROPRIATE TRAININg
PROgRAMS
Children  are  not  miniature  adults,  so  their  training  pro-
grams  should  be  appropriate  for  their  age  and  maturity
levels.  Ideally,  physical  development  should  begin  during
early  childhood.  Children  should  have  the  opportunity  to
move, run, jump, throw, lift, and pull.

Many  gyms  have  movement  exploration  programs,  such
as  Kindergym,  that  provide  semi-structured  movement
experiences.  Children  can  climb  ladders  and  ropes,  carry
objects,  walk  in  sand,  run  up  and  down  hills,  jump  into
foam  boxes,  hang  from  bars,  and  tumble  on  mats.  These
programs allow children to learn movement skills and a love
for physical activity.

Parents  should  promote  physical  activity  and  discourage
sedentary activities from a young age. Hours spent in front
of  the  television  or  Internet  are  directly  related  to  excess
weight. Bad habits developed in pre-school can easily con-
tinue throughout childhood and adolescence.

It is best to begin conservatively. When your athlete can do
a minimal program, add exercises or train more intensely.
Consistency is the key. Follow the principles of training dis-
cussed in prior chapters and your athletes will likely achieve
their goals with a minimal risk of injury.

Developing training discipline takes years. Sports excellence
is  based  on  skill  development.  Emphasize  fundamentals
over competition in younger children. Competitive success
depends on competence in the sport. The age of specializa-
tion depends on the sport. Early training is critical in sports

such as gymnastics, figure skating, and swimming. This has
as much to do with the culture of these sports as it does with
physical  readiness.  In  swimming,  for  example,  older  ath-
letes—such as Dara Torres (who won three Olympic med-
als at age 41)—have shown that elite athletes do not have to
retire at age 20. Training intensity can increase as children
develop  competence  in  the  sport  and  intrinsic  motivation
that makes them want to improve and win.

to  be  continuous.  Combine  walking  to  and  from  school
with walking up stairs (instead of taking the elevator) and
structured exercise at school with physically active house-
hold chores, like mowing the lawn. Ideally, the young per-
son  should  supplement  these  exercises  with  resistive  and
flexibility  exercises.  Combine  the  activity  program  with  a
well-balance  diet  high  in  fruits,  vegetables,  low-fat  dairy
foods, whole grains, and lean meats.

DESIgNINg ThE
TRAININg PROgRAM
First,  determine  the  young  person’s  goals.  If  the  goal  is
simply  to  improve  health,  then  the  program  will  be  quite
simple. If he or she wants to become a better skier, tennis
player, golfer, body builder, or discus thrower, then the pro-
gram becomes more complicated. Balance skill and fitness
development to improve sports performance.

hIgher levelS oF FITneSS
Children interested in higher levels of general fitness should
do some type of moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise
three to five times per week, resistive exercise two to three
times  a  week,  and  flexibility  exercises  five  to  seven  times
per  week.  If  your  client  wants  to  become  faster  and  more
powerful, incorporate interval training and power and plyo-
metric exercises in the program. The child can do the exercise
program at home, in a health club, or at the local track, park,
or pool.

general FITneSS For healTh
Fitness  for  health  was  described  earlier  in  this  section  of
the course. To summarize, try to do a total of  60 minutes
a day of some kind of exercise. The exercise does not have

Choose  aerobic  exercises  clients  enjoy.  Choices  include
walking, running, swimming, aerobic, cross-country skiing,
cycling, and sports such as tennis or basketball. Do aerobic
exercise for at least 20 minutes. If the client cannot perform
20 minutes at first, have him build up to it gradually.

International Sports Sciences Association222  |  unit 15

Children can do resistance exercises on the same day as they
do aerobic exercises. However, serious weight trainers often
do resistance and aerobic exercises on separate days. For ex-
ample,  an  athlete  might  run  on  Monday,  Wednesday,  and
Friday; lift weights on Tuesdays and Thursdays; and rest on
Saturday and Sunday.

Do  flexibility  exercises  at  the  end  of  the  workout.
Muscles are warm and will be much less susceptible to in-
jury. Be consistent with the stretching program. People de-
velop considerable improvements in flexibility by stretching
for as little as 10 minutes a day.

FITneSS ProgramS and
Power SPorTS
No  single  fitness  training  program  is  appropriate  for  all
sports.  This  section  presents  two  examples  that  serve  as
templates. Examples in Tables 15.2 and 15.3 show programs
for a recreational athlete (a skier) and a competitive athlete
(a football player). In general, during the off-season, devel-
op skill as well as general strength, endurance, and flexibility
fitness.  As  the  season  nears,  place  increasing  emphasis  on
skill, power, and speed.

The central goal is to develop movement skills for the sport.
A tennis player who can’t serve or hit a good forehand or
backhand will not do very well in a match, no matter how

good  his  or  her  physical  fitness  components  are.  Athletes
achieve the best results by systematically integrating fitness
and skill.

Skill Development
Young athletes should work on specific skills all year long.
This is important for competitive and recreational athletes.
If the sport is seasonal, try to work on skills at least two days
per week during the off-season. Make sure to practice the
correct movements. Repeating mistakes reinforces mistakes
and  poor  movement  patterns.  Remember  this  important
principle of sports training: “Perfect practice makes perfect.”

Do not let athletes use bad weather as an excuse. When it’s
raining, the tennis player can hit balls against a wall in the
gym, the golfer can work on the swing in an indoor range,
and the discus thrower can work on turns in the garage. If
all else fails, they can watch instructional videos on skiing,
golf, shot putting, tennis, football, volleyball, and softball.

During the season, increase the amount of time devoted to
practicing  skills.  During  the  golf,  softball,  tennis,  or  track
seasons, devote at least four days a week to skills practice.
Never  substitute  fitness  for  skill  development.  The  golfer
with a poor swing will shoot poorly even if he or she can
run fast or has a great bench press.

When combining sports and fitness, develop strength and
endurance during the off-season. As the season nears, place

more  emphasis  on  power,  speed,  and  plyometric  training.
During the season, the goal is to maintain strength and en-
durance fitness and master sports skills at full speed.

bodY buIldIng
Many  young  people—particularly  high  school  students—
exercise so they can build and maintain healthy, attractive
looking  bodies.  The  basic  principle  behind  a  successful
bodybuilding  program  is  simple:  build  muscle  tissue  and
minimize body fat. This principle is the same for boys and
girls, men and women.

Bodybuilders generally do a high number of sets and rep-
etitions (5 to 10 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions) in a wide vari-
ety of exercises (10 to 25 exercises). Many successful body
builders also employ low repetition, high  weight exercises
for large muscle exercises such as squats and bench presses.
Many athletes will benefit from doing a single set of 8 to 12
repetition in 5 to 10 exercises.

Endurance training is important for young people who are
trying  to  improve  their  body  composition.  In  addition  to
promoting  health,  it  affords  an  effective  means  to  control
body  fat.  They  should  do  endurance  exercises  in  the  gym
on a stair climbing machine, treadmill, or stationary bicycle.
Many people enjoy outdoor activities such as jogging in the
park or cycling on the roads. (Table 15.4)

endurance FITneSS
Endurance  sports  are  extremely  popular  throughout  the
world. Endurance races, such as the Bay-to-Breakers in San
Francisco, the New York marathon, the Iron Man triathlon,
and  the  Western  States  100,  attract  thousands  of  contest-
ants.  Lesser-known  races  in  running,  cycling,  swimming,
triathlon,  snowshoeing,  cross-country  skiing,  and  roller-
blading are held in almost every community of any size in
America.  Most  of  the  contestants  are  not  Olympic  hope-
fuls. Rather, they are ordinary people who love endurance
competitions and high levels of fitness. Children and young
adults  have  also  been  attracted  to  endurance  sports.  They
often get their start in local fun runs before competing seri-
ously in the sport.

Endurance  athletes  should  practice  over-distance  training
to develop endurance capacity, interval training to develop
speed and pace, and weight training to develop strength and
power. During the off-season (the time of year when there
are few competitions), emphasize over-distance training. As
the season nears, include more interval training workouts.
Lift  weights  year  round.  During  the  competitive  season,
strive  only  to  maintain  strength  by  lifting  weights  one  to
two times weekly.

There is no one best training program for everyone. Children are not miniature adults, so their training programs
should be appropriate to their age and maturity levels. Consider the athlete’s age, goals, skills, strengths and
weaknesses, likes and dislikes, and motivation when designing a training program. Plan realistic, fun programs for
children that they will do it consistently. Begin conservatively and then gradually increase the intensity and com-
plexity of the program. No single fitness training program is appropriate for all sports. Athletes achieve the best
results by systematically integrating fitness and skill.

# Helping The Child Enjoy
# Sports And Physical Activity

230  |  unit 16

Athletics  and  physical  activity  can  be  among  the  most
valuable and cherished experiences in life, whether the child
becomes  an  Olympic  gold-medallist,  plays  third  string  on
the  high  school  football  team,  or  enjoys  a  run  or  walk  in
the  park.  Parents  and  personal  trainers  can  help  to  make
sports and exercise a positive experience by providing help
and  understanding  to  the  young  person.  Adult  guidance
is  the  same  for  both  serious  and  casual  participation  in
sports:  helping  the  child  to  achieve  his  or  her  goals  in  an
emotionally  healthy  environment.  To  the  national-class
athlete,  this  may  mean  coping  with  the  stress  of  intense
training and competition. To the average child, it may mean
developing skills in an atmosphere of fun.

Personal  trainers  who  work  with  young  people  must  be
applied  sports  psychologists.  They  should  strive  to  make
sports and physical activity enjoyable experiences that build
fitness and character. They must help children to cope with
emotional problems associated with training and try to keep
sports in their proper perspective. Children’s self–esteem is
vitally  important,  but  personal  trainers  and  coaches  must
instill in children that esteem comes from accomplishment
and that not everyone wins. Selecting the right sport is an
important part of insuring enjoyment and success.

hOW TO SELECT ThE
RIghT SPORT
It  is  crucial  that  children  select  a  sport  they  enjoy.  If  the
athletic  experience  is  enjoyable,  tremendous  achievement
will  not  be  a  necessity.  Participation  itself  produces  both
physical and psychological benefits.

It  seems  reasonable  that  a  certain  measure  of  success  is
usually  required  for  full  enjoyment  in  sport.  Athletics
usually caters to the physically gifted, and social pressures
exerted  on  the  less–skilled  and  uncoordinated  child  can
prove  overwhelming  (and  devastating  to  the  child).  The
parents,  personal  trainer,  and  child  should  consider  the
available options and the physical and emotional realities.

Determine the sport in which the child has potential. The
gym  class  serves  as  a  wonderful  proving  ground.  Can  the
child run fast? Is he bigger or stronger than the other kids?
Is she an early or late maturer? Is she good at any one sport
in  particular?  If  the  child  shows  good  performance  in
skills like catching, throwing, and running, he may wish to
consider  softball,  baseball,  basketball,  soccer,  field  hockey
(girls),  or  football  (boys).  In  contrast,  if  the  child  does
not  seem  as  coordinated  as  the  other  kids,  then  perhaps
an  alternative  such  as  weight  lifting,  distance  running,  or
swimming might be more appropriate.

Sports can be placed into one of three general types: team
and complex movement-oriented sports (basketball, soccer,
tennis,  and  football);  fitness-oriented  sports  (distance
running, weight lifting, and body building); and technique-
oriented sports (discus throwing, gymnastics, diving, golf,
and  figure  skating).  Some  overlap  exists,  but  the  general
categories can help you and the child select the right sports.

Complex movement sports are generally the most popular
and  most  highly  regarded  in  schools,  and  thus  the  most
competitive. A less–skilled child may be better off choosing
a  sport  from  one  of  the  other  categories.  However,  this
depends on the child’s desires. If a boy has always wanted
to be a football player, or a girl a basketball or tennis player,
do not discourage them. Often, there are junior varsity or
intramural teams that allow for participation of younger or
less–skilled children.

Success  in  sports  is  often  a  matter  of  sustained  focus.
A  popular  book  called  Outliers:  The  Story  of  Success  by
Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown and Company) contends
that  successful  people  must  devote  at  least  10,000  hours
of  focused  practice  to  achieve  success  in  sports.  Contrary
to  popular  belief,  they  do  not  have  to  possess  unusual
talent; they just have to be talented enough. Success comes
when  athletes  have  the  drive  to  achieve,  are  placed  in  an
environment  that  fosters  success,  and  devote  the  time
required to develop high skill levels.

Fitness-oriented sports offer the less–skilled child a chance
for  some  degree  of  athletic  success.  High  levels  of  success
at the national and international levels have certain genetic
prerequisites, yet any child can become proficient in sports
by  diligent,  hard  work.  Most  young  athletes  do  not  know
the meaning of the term hard work, and thus barely scratch
the surface of their potential. A child cannot rely on high
school  track  practice  or  the  weight  training  gym  class  to
attain  great  improvements;  they  must  practice  during  the
summer,  during  vacations,  and  on  weekends.  The  key  to
success in the less–skilled youngster is to work even harder
than the other kids. This requires self-discipline on the part
of the child and continued support from parents, coaches,
and the personal trainer.

Technique  sports  offer  unique  opportunities  for  athletic
success.  High  achievement  on  the  competitive  level  in
complex  technique  sports—hammer  throwing,  equestrian
games, diving, gymnastics, and fly casting—requires years
of  practice.  But  many  of  these  activities  can  provide  the
smaller  girl  or  boy  with  a  chance  for  athletic  success  that
might  not  be  possible  in  football,  basketball,  track,  or
baseball.  It  is  sometimes  better  to  be  a  big  fish  in  a  small
pond than to be overwhelmed by the currents in the ocean.
Willie Sutton, the famous holdup man, was once asked why

Youth Fitnesshelping the Child Enjoy Sports and Physical Activity  |  231

he  robbed  banks.  He  answered,  “Because  that’s  where  the
money is.” Technique sports can be where the success is. I
believe  participation  is  the  real  essence  of  sport,  and  that
participation is extremely satisfying if the child is successful
and good at the sport.

The PerSonal TraIner

Professional performance analysis can help the child assess
potential for various sports and pinpoint deficiencies. This
course includes test batteries that can help to assess power,
speed,  strength,  endurance,  and  body  composition.  They
are useful but not foolproof. Science can help to determine
sports  tendencies,  but  cannot  predict  absolute  success
or  failure.  Sports  medicine  can  distinguish  a  child  with
potential  for  endurance  or  speed  sports,  but  does  little  to
predict ability in technique sports. Technique requires years
of focused practice.

Years  ago,  an  all-star  professional  basketball  player  was
tested  in  an  exercise  physiology  laboratory  as  part  of  a
publicity  campaign.  The  local  newspaper  was  planning  to
print a story that compared the pro-basketball player with
the  average  weekend  jock.  This  was  the  question:  How  is

this  all-star  professional  different  from  the  average  guy?
The scientists tested both men using common physiological
measurements:  work  capacity  and  oxygen  uptake  on  the
treadmill, body fat and muscle mass, muscle strength and
power, flexibility, and muscle fiber type. Each of these tests
measured capacity rather than skill.

The findings were startling—the weekend jock performed at
almost the same level on most of the tests as the pro player,
even though the basketball star was one of the top athletes of
his kind in the world. The truth is that the basketball skills of
the professional athlete were highly developed for basketball,
but lab tests could only measure fitness. The point is that lab
tests can be important for determining athletic capacity, but
should not be the only consideration in selecting a sport or
predicting success in the sport.

how Young Should
a chIld begIn
comPeTITIon?
The age at which a child should begin to compete depends
on the nature of the sport. Some sports require specialization
at a young age. For example, girls as young as 11 or 12 are
world-class competitors in gymnastics (they must be 14 to
compete in the Olympics). These girls begin their training

International Sports Sciences Association232  |  unit 16

at four to six years of age because early participation may
be essential for high-level performance in this sport. Older
teenage girls tend to have more fat and wider hips, factors
that can be a disadvantage in gymnastics. Football and track
and field events (discus, shot put, and hammer and javelin
throwing) require physical maturity for success.

Consider the following when helping a child choose a sport:

1.

Is early participation in sports in the interest of the
child’s emotional and physical health?

2.  Will early participation provide the child with
an advantage in skill development over other
children?

3.  Will early athletic participation compromise the
child’s development in other areas (other sports,
social development, music and art appreciation,
intellectual pursuits)?

Competition can compromise emotional health if begun too
early.  Early  childhood  sports  programs  should  emphasize
skill  and  fundamentals.  Winning  comes  naturally  when
athletes  have  developed  a  solid  foundation.  Preparation
and planning are the keys to winning and success in sports.
Children’s sports often seem to be conducted for the benefit
and gratification of adults. Young children are usually not
emotionally prepared for the adult standards they might be
exposed to in highly structured competitive athletics.

Competitive  athletics  are  not  necessarily  bad  for  children
under  age  10.  There  are  outstanding  programs  in  most
sports  for  young  children  that  stress  skill  development,
maximum participation, and fun.

Parents and personal trainers should scrutinize the prospective
team or athletic club and assess the organizational structure
in view of the following five factors:

1.  What is the nature of practices? Are they conduct-

ed with intelligence, knowledge, and humanity?

2.  How is the competitive structure organized? Is too
much emphasis placed on winning? At lower
levels, do all the kids get to play, or do better-
skilled children dominate games? Is too much
emphasis placed on awards, all-star games, and
championship participation at an early age?

3.  Does the structure of the program promote

development and excellence? Participation and
skill development are critical during the early
years of participation. Later, the program should
promote excellence through progressive develop-
ment for children who want to excel. This might
include competitions at the regional, national, and
international levels.

4.  Does the program consider maturational differ-

ences among children? Studies of athlete burnout
show that kids born later in the year (i.e., less
mature children) are less likely to achieve success
and more likely to suffer burnout in the sport.

5.  Who are the coaches? Are they professionals well

trained in skills, teaching, and child development?
Or are they parents who seem to be most inter-
ested in getting their own kids into the game?

Where  skill  is  concerned,  it  is  doubtful  that  participation
in  competitive  athletics  before  the  age  of  eight  or  ten  will
give the child the jump on other kids. For boys especially,
the rapid development of physical capacity and skill occurs
during puberty and adolescence. Children between the ages
of  five  and  ten  should  only  belong  to  organized  teams  if
those teams provide an atmosphere for learning a variety of
movement fundamentals and developing a love of the sport.

Some  sports  are  clearly  better  than  others  for  young
children. For example, gymnastics and soccer provide many
opportunities to develop fitness and movement skills, while
tennis  and  baseball  require  skills  that  five-  to  eight-year-
olds  do  not  have  the  maturity  to  develop.  Of  course,  you
want  the  child  to  learn  complex  ball-handling  skills.  But
these  are  developed  best  by  practicing  specific  basic  skills
and  not  necessarily  by  mere  participation  in  competitive
athletics. To become skilled, a child must specialize at some
point, but the specialization for most sports need not take
place before puberty.

Youth Fitnesshelping the Child Enjoy Sports and Physical Activity  |  233

Puberty  is  the  ideal  time  for  specialization.  Children  who
began  sports  like  skiing,  tennis,  or  golf  at  age  twenty  or
twenty-five are at a decided disadvantage compared to those
who  began  at  age  six.  Usually  the  gap  cannot  be  closed,
regardless  of  how  much  the  older  person  practices.  There
simply is no way a man of 60 who takes up golf, no matter
how skilled he may have been during his younger years, can
ever “catch-up” with the skills and proficiency gained by a
youngster who develops golf skills at age eight or nine and
plays regularly for the next 50 years! The child has the clear
advantage, and therein is the proof. Children who develop
basic skills at an early age and continue in their sport can
enjoy a lifetime of pleasure from regular participation.

are aThleTIcS SaFe?
Organized  sports  for  children,  particularly  junior-level
football  and  baseball,  often  receive  bad  press.  Much  of
this  criticism  is  unjustified.  Though  many  injuries  occur
in  high  school  and  college  football,  some  sports  critics
attempt to extrapolate the dangers of college football to little
league football. The argument goes like this: if football is a
dangerous sport for high school and college players, then it
must be even worse for young children with growing bones.
The truth is that the injury rate in young football players is
much lower than among high school, college, or professional
players.  Young  children  are  smaller,  slower,  and  generally
less  aggressive  than  older  athletes.  The  power  to  generate
the tremendous forces that can cause serious injuries in the
older players does not exist in junior-level players.

ProvIdIng a good SPorTS
exPerIence
Children sometimes specialize in a sport as early as ages 10
to 14. In general, kids should try a variety of sports for as
long as possible. No one can force a child to like and enjoy
sports.  Once  a  child  has  shown  an  interest,  though,  there
are  many  things  adults  can  do  to  help  make  the  athletic
experience positive.

The emoTIonal elemenTS
Remember that the child is the one involved in the sports
program, not you or the parent. Parents should not try to
relive  their  dreams  through  their  sons  or  daughters.  The
child should be central in the decision making process about
the degree of involvement in the sport. Some mistakes are
inevitable, but so is some measure of success. The bottom
line is—let the child do it!

Consider  the  child’s  motivation.  Not  everyone  wants  to
be  an  Olympic  champion.  Some  kids  just  want  to  be  part
of  a  group  or  to  be  with  their  friends.  For  these  children,
participation in athletics is valuable even though they may
achieve little success.

Do not overreact to the situation. If the child expresses an
interest in being a ski racer, do not run out the next day to
buy $1500 worth of equipment and clothing. Children often
are  not  sure  what  they  really  want.  Provide  opportunities
for participation; if the child is genuinely serious about the
sport,  then  spend  the  money  on  equipment.  Once  a  child
is seriously involved in sports, buy the best equipment the
family  can  afford.  Competitive  sports  are  difficult  enough
without  the  athlete’s  being  hampered  by  poor  equipment.
A good pair of ice hockey skates can cost several hundred
dollars. Buying skates on special at a large department store
will  save  some  money,  but  it  might  also  be  the  cause  of
injury and discomfort for the child.

Perhaps  the  most  important  responsibility  a  parent  or
personal trainer has toward an athletic child is to provide
emotional support. It is difficult for a kid to sit on the bench
or perform poorly. Let the child know that you understand
the  problem.  Provide  guidance—sometimes  a  child  may
want  to  quit  the  team  when  things  get  tough.  Children
should learn to stick it out and overcome adversity. A little
understanding  and  direction  from  parents  can  keep  the
athletic experience in its proper perspective for the child.

International Sports Sciences Association234  |  unit 16

gIrlS and aThleTIcS
Although women and girls have many more opportunities
in sports today than in the past, there still is a great deal of
discrimination  and  stigma  attached  to  their  participation.
Athletics are a critical part of the education of all children,
not  just  boys.  For  example,  parents  should  insist  that  a
daughter (or, for that matter, anyone’s daughter) receive an
equal opportunity for athletic participation.

Girls should have the same quality of coaching as boys, but
forcing boys and girls to play on the same team is probably
not a good idea. Teenage boys are usually physically superior
to teenage girls. If there is only one team and it is coed, most
girls will not get a chance to play. If a girl is good enough
to  play  on  a  boys’  team,  she  should  have  the  opportunity
to do so; otherwise, she should play for a girls’ team. Girls’
teams should not be forced to play on second-rate fields or
treated  differently  in  any  other  way,  and  this  includes  the
opportunities they are afforded at fitness and health clubs. If
disparities exist, become a vocal advocate for kids’ equality
in sports participation.

TeachIng KIdS To
wIn and loSe

Athletics can be the most positive and enjoyable experience
of  a  lifetime.  Young  athletes  develop  friendships  and
psychological  benefits  that  carry  over  into  adulthood.
Competition  is  an  unavoidable  part  of  sports,  and  an
unavoidable  part  of  life.  Children  must  learn  to  enjoy
winning and cope with losing. Many athletes sacrifice almost
everything to win, only to have their hopes shattered. Defeat
can discourage and break some athletes. You must teach the
child to shake it off and move on to something else, or try
again. Fortunately, in sports, there always is another day for
another competition.

There is a price to pay for both success and failure in athletics.
But with the proper preparation and mental attitude a child
can  cope  with  both.  The  parent  and  the  personal  trainer
can  help  to  keep  things  in  their  proper  perspective  by
encouraging a healthy attitude.

Youth Fitnesshelping the Child Enjoy Sports and Physical Activity  |  235

Keeping things in perspective with the encouragement of a
healthy attitude:

1.  Teach children that winning or losing has little to

do with their worth as people. If they lose, they
are not bad people, and if they win, they are not
better than anyone else.

2.  Success requires sacrifice and hard work. Top

performance in any sport requires long hours of
training. Everybody who makes it to the Olympics
or a professional sports team has worked extreme-
ly hard. The secret of success in athletics is to work
hard, train intelligently, get good coaching, and
make the most of natural ability and luck.

3.  Tell kids to always do their best. As Bear Bryant,

the great football coach said, “My 90-percent
player playing 100 percent will beat your 100-per-
cent ball player playing 90 percent every time.”
Concentrate on what you are doing. Leave noth-
ing to chance; if there is a weakness, correct it.

4.  Be in the best possible condition. Out-of-shape

athletes are in trouble, no matter how skilled they
are. Getting in top shape takes work. The divi-
dends are a reduced risk of injury and an
increased ability to learn basic movement skills.

5.  Teach kids to learn from their mistakes. Analyze
their technique and teach them to become as

The  National  Association  of  Sports  and  Physical  Education
has outlined ten basic rights of children involved in athletics:

1.  Right of the opportunity for participation in sports

regardless of ability level

2.  Right to participate at a level commensurate with

each child’s development level

3.  Right to have qualified adult leadership

4.  Right to participate in safe and healthy environ-

ments

5.  Right of each child to share in the leadership and
decision-making of their sports participation

6.  Right to play as a child and not as an adult

7.  Right to proper preparation for participation in

the sport

8.  Right to an equal opportunity to strive for success

9.  Right to be treated with dignity by all involved

10.  Right to have fun through sport

SuMMARY

Personal trainers are in a unique and important position to help children enjoy
and benefit from sports. They can help them to choose the right sport and
maximize their chances for success. They can also help them to handle winning
and losing and teach them how to learn from their mistakes.

Seven key points in this section include:

1.  Hard work and dedication are the great equalizers in athletics. The
child who consistently works hard will eventually realize success.

2.  Success and enjoyment in athletics require selecting the right sport.

Selection should be based on preference, talent, body size, family
finances, and availability and practicality of the sport.

3.  Early competition is not usually in a child’s best interest. Sports

participation before age twelve should stress the development of basic
movement skills and fundamentals, rather than competition.

4.  Parents and personal trainers should encourage and help children get

fit and maintain fitness all year long.

5.  Personal trainers and parents should help children to keep athletics
in proper perspective. Shortsighted decisions may be detrimental.
Encourage children to develop intellectually, socially, and athletically.

6.

Insights from sports medicine and science can help children to im-
prove. Modern developments in equipment and training methods
enhance performance and future enjoyment in sport and physical
activity experiences.

7.  Girls should have the same opportunities for athletic participation

as boys.

# Psychology Of The Champion

238  |  unit 17

Part  of  long  term  athletic  development  of  children  in-
volves  teaching  them  training  discipline,  competitiveness,
and sportsmanship. Discipline includes the ability to train
systematically, work on mistakes, and become a student of
the  sport.  Competitiveness  includes  building  high  levels
of skill, learning to overcome adversity, setting short-term
and  long-term  goals,  learning  to  win  and  lose  with  grace,
learning from defeats, and striving for success. Becoming a
student of the sport involves learning training methods and
technique and understanding the process.

ThE WINNINg EDgE
Competitive  sports  serve  as  one  of  the  ultimate  proving
grounds  of  human  beings.  Competition  brings  together
exquisitely  prepared  men  and  women  in  a  pressure-cook-
er  atmosphere.  All  of  them  are  trying  to  achieve  the  same
thing:  victory.  The  winners  are  those  best  prepared  both
physically  and  mentally.  The  line  between  success  and
failure  is  sometimes  no  more  than  a  hundredth  of  a  sec-
ond or a few millimeters. The great champion always seems
to give that little extra that achieves the margin of victory,
no  matter  how  small  it  may  be.  Sports  immortals  such  as
Michael  Jordan,  Michael  Phelps,  Bruce  Jenner,  Al  Oerter,
Tiger Woods, and Jesse Owens have that special “something”
that sets them apart and makes them great. What are these
mysterious psychological ingredients that come together to
constitute a winner? Why is it that a person who may hold
the world record and completely dominate an event or sport
will sometimes fold in the Olympics or Super Bowl, while an-
other person—perhaps injured and less physically skilled—
will rise up in major competitions for a great victory?

In  a  major  competition  like  the  Olympics,  about  six  or  so
athletes at the Olympic starting line have good chances; but
out of those six, one knows he or she is going to win. And
there is a big difference between wanting to win and knowing

you will win. Merely making a high school, college, Olym-
pic,  or  professional  team  requires  tremendous  drive  and
single-minded  dedication  to  one’s  sport.  Champions  must
exhibit exceptional mettle in the company of so many tough-
minded, highly skilled competitors. The personal trainer can
help children  begin  to develop the  mental attitude it takes
to succeed in sport. Every child cannot make the Olympic
team, but every child can learn to think like a winner.

Successful American athletes are criticized in some circles
because of their lifestyles: total devotion to their sport often
signals an expense to their careers, their family and, in some
instances, their health. Yet this lifestyle is the inevitable con-
sequence of the requirements of world-class performance.
Olympic competition is so severe that to become compla-
cent will mean the loss of the chance to compete.

Much of the appeal of sports stems from the fact that ath-
letes are forced to face the Moment of Truth. Sports places
success and failure directly before the public eye. Few en-
deavors of life hold achievement—or lack of it—so blatantly
visible. Such an environment demands a realistic perspec-
tive and eventually will weed out aspiring athletes who may
be unable to face the truth about their limited abilities.

ThE PSYChOLOgY OF ThE
ChAMPION AThLETE
Top-caliber  sports  have  been  called  the  “PTA  Club”—for
Pain,  Tears,  and  Agony.  Sports  psychologists  have  studied
successful  athletes  in  great  detail  and  have  found—with
few  remarkable  exceptions—that  champion  level  athletes
are  extremely  stabile  emotionally.  The  survival-of-the-
fittest atmosphere of elite sport, coupled with the physically
exhausting  training  and  the  requisite  psychological  per-
spective  of  sports  at  this  level,  demands  a  great  degree  of
mental and emotional toughness even to participate.

Dr. Bruce Ogilvie (1920-2003), the grandfather of North American sports psychology who taught at California State Uni-
versity at San Jose, described the mental and emotional character of the champion caliber athlete: “Successful athletes
are achievement-oriented people who derive personal satisfaction from striving. High achievement needs are based upon
personal attitudes about the probability of success or failure associated with each investment of self or ego. All things
considered, the outstanding athlete is at his very best when the odds are slightly against him. Ambitious people derive
slight joy, if any, when their ability remains uncontested. The great athletes I have interviewed do not dwell upon their
losses but concentrate on that part of their performance that limits their excellence.

Great athletes have a great need to be on top, and show as a group an exceedingly high need to be successful.” Dr.
Ogilvie continued, “They have a greater need for freedom and self-direction, preferring to make their own judgments as
to what’s good for them. They have a greater need for the spotlight than the average person and enjoy receiving more
attention and acclaim. Champion athletes seem to have an easier time expressing aggressive tendencies and standing
up for what they believe—they have a greater tendency to fight for their point of view. Their ability to engage in abstract
thinking placed them in the upper 15 percent of the population. Champion athletes have a greater awareness of reality;
they “tell it like it is.”

PSYchologIcal dIFFerenceS among aThleTeS
Sports  scientists  have  noted  few  psychological  differences
between  male  and  female  athletes.  Women  in  sports  tend
to  be  less  dominant  than  men,  but  more  impulsive,  more
aware of danger, more apt to punish themselves when they
lose, and more concerned with other people. These differ-
ences may stem from pressures on women athletes, however
subtle,  to  conform  to  traditional  ideas  of  femininity.  The
typical male “winning-at-all-cost” philosophy is considered
unfeminine by many segments of our society. Women are
not  supposed  to  sweat  and  get  strong.  Although  women
have more opportunities than ever in sports, culturally de-
fined role models of masculinity and femininity are slow to
change. Any pressures that are rooted in these traditionalist
roles can exert many negative effects on female athletes by
increasing the odds against success in top-level competition.

Most  sports  psychology  studies  show  little  difference  in
character  profile  among  athletes  in  various  sports.  There
are  exceptions,  however.  Runners  and  race  walkers  tend
to be more introverted and more insecure than other ath-
letes. There are also differences in character between medal
winners  and  non-medal  winners.  Probably  the  greatest
quality unique to medalists is their almost complete absence
of physical fear. This trait has obvious benefits for the cham-
pion. Breaking the pain threshold is usually associated with
top  performance—the  winner  has  the  ability  to  maximize
his or her ability by teetering on the brink of disaster.

The  character  traits  of  typical  female  athletes  set  them
apart from most average women: they need and seek high
goals  and  high  achievement.  They  have  strong  desires  to
accomplish something of significance. They thrive on being
in the spotlight, and enjoy being at the center of attention.
They  have  a  strongly  developed  sense  of  independence
and autonomy and an ability to express aggression without
feeling  guilt.  Such  women  tend  to  be  tough-minded,  self-
assured,  self-confident,  very  trusting,  and  self-assertive.
They measure slightly above average in emotional maturity
and  rarely  experience  feelings  of  depression.  In  general,
the  character  profiles  of  successful  female  athletes  are
remarkably similar to their male counterparts.

Olympic  medal  winners  are  different  in  other  ways:
medalists  tend  to  be  more  independent,  less  inclined  to
want  to  be  members  of  a  group,  more  self-reliant  and
self-disciplined,  and  more  ambitious.  Many  medalists  are
stimulus addicts—they have a much greater need to bring
change into their lives with new and different experiences.
This  trait  is  particularly  important  for  younger,  less
experienced athletes because it enables them to achieve one
goal and immediately set a new, higher one. Making a team
(high school, college, pro, or Olympic) can be a great shock
in  itself.  It  can  be  difficult  to  quickly  shift  goals  to  win  a
medal or produce at championship play levels.

Other  athletes  showing  deviations  from  the  norm  are
those in high-risk sports. This includes Alpine skiers, who
plummet  down  icy  mountainsides  at  speeds  exceeding  75
miles per hour, and athletes in X-Games. These performers

International Sports Sciences Association240  |  unit 17

excel in tests of abstract reasoning. They can derive a form
of  psychic  ecstasy  by  tempting  fate  during  sports  and  are
very  aware  of  the  risks  they  take.  Often  these  athletes  are
loners, but they also are leaders and expect to be treated as
such. In general, they are very together people.

There is little evidence to suggest that participation in high-
level athletic competition can actually benefit mental health.
Most  athletes  are  emotionally  stable  because  they  entered
sports that way in the first place. Four-time Olympic discus
gold medal winner Al Oerter showed his tough, competent
mental approach to sport when he said, “I don’t play men-
tal games. I prepare myself for competition as best I can. I
never make any excuses. If I have any weak points, I correct
them. Once I’m in a big competition, I just concentrate on
doing the best I can—I don’t worry about anything else.”

Athletes  have  to  be  psychologically  sound  to  survive  the
pressures of high-level sports, but the stress of competition
can sometimes be overpowering. About 40 to 50 percent of
Olympic athletes feel excessive stress concerned with their
performance. The psychologist can sometimes help athletes
deal with stress and anxiety and enable them to reach full
potential. People in sports are individuals first and athletes
second. The quest for athletic excellence must never be at the
expense of emotional health. People should not let accom-
plishment in sport become a disguise for personal growth.

ThE ELEMENTS OF SuCCESS
One  of  the  best  descriptions  of  the  psychological  factors
necessary  for  Olympic  success  was  made  by  John  Powell,
four-time Olympian, two-time bronze medal winner in the
discus throw, and former world record holder. He threw the
discus more than 236 feet when he was 40 years old. Powell
is an inspiration to aspiring young athletes because he has
gone a long way on much less natural physical ability than
his competitors. He continues to help young people through
his throwing clinics held every year at Dennison University
in Ohio (www.johnpowellassociates.com).

Through hard work and self-confidence, Powell developed
almost  flawless  technique  and  a  reputation  for  coming  up
with  a  crucial  performance  when  it  was  needed.  He  said,
“The psychological tenacity necessary for success in sports
can be broken down into three simple factors: belief, vision,
and method. Belief is self-confidence knowing your worth
as an athlete and knowing you can do well. Vision is your
goal.  You  have  to  know  what  you  want  in  order  to  get  it.
Method  is  the  process  you  use  to  fulfill  your  vision—how
you train and how you handle yourself in the pressure and
excitement of competition.”

belIeF
Belief  means  having  confidence  in  your  abilities.  Self-
confidence  is  perhaps  the  athlete’s  most  important  mental
attribute.  You  must  have  it  for  success.  Self-confidence
takes  a  long  time  to  develop;  it  is  something  you  must
learn.  Self-confidence  is  based  on  accomplishment,  and
succeeding  in  a  series  of  short-term  goals  develops  it.  As
your  trainees  experience  a  number  of  small  victories  and
accomplishments, they will begin to realize that everything
is possible. Then, the only thing that can stop from getting
what  they  want  is  themselves.  If  they  do  not  believe  they
can  achieve  something,  there  is  no  way  they  will  do  it.
Confidence or belief is the cornerstone of athletic success—
or success in almost any endeavor.

Belief is critical in sports where athletes are constantly up
against  unexpected  situations  and  each  person  is  out  for
himself. Athletes must have confidence. The competition is
out  to  win  any  way  they  can.  Athletes  must  feel  they  can
take  care  of  themselves—whatever  happens—and  must
have  confidence  in  their  own  judgments.  They  must  have
the  courage  to  choose  a  strategy  and  stick  to  it.  Without
that  kind  of  self-confidence,  they  are  vulnerable  and  their
competitor will psyche them out.

The psychology of athletic competition is often overt. Many
athletic  champions  use  intricate  psychological  tactics  to
thwart  the  self-confidence  of  opponents.  The  psych-out

Youth FitnessPsychology of the Champion  |  241

can be complex or simple. It can be applied a minute before
competition  or  it  can  be  continued  carefully  over  several
days, months, or even years. It can be directed against a single
rival or against the entire field. The techniques vary, but the
object is always the same: convince the competition that you
are certain to win the competition and they are going to lose.
In a psych-out, you always make a show of confidence while
you work to undermine the confidence of your competition.
In one of the great team “psych-outs,” two Nordic ski teams
were going head to head in a final competition. One team
with  Olympic  medalists  was  a  heavy  favorite  against  an
excellent but less experienced neighboring team. Four days
before the competition, the coach of the underdogs planted
a tube in the snow with a mysterious looking black and silver
canister  attached  to  it  at  the  site  of  the  training  runs.  His
athletes took turns “breathing” from the canister just before
their training workouts, easily viewed by the competitors (the
coach  planned  it  that  way). This  practice  with  the  “secret”
device continued during the last two days of practice. A local
sports scribe, in interviewing the coach, asked him what it
was.  The  coach  replied,  “I  really  can’t  tell  you  the  details,
but it boosts athletic performance by 20 percent. Every time
the athletes breathe from the tube, it supercharges their red
blood cells, boosting their skiing power.” This made the local
papers and heightened interest in the competition. Everyone
was talking  about the “secret training weapon.” Years after
the  competition,  won  by  the  slimmest  of  margins  by  the
underdogs,  the  coach  at  his  retirement  party,  revealed  he
had concocted the story about the device giving his athletes
a competitive edge: it had been a total fabrication. The key
points  were  first,  the  underdog  athletes  believed  to  their
core that it gave them an edge against the world champions;
and  second,  the  former  champions  came  to  believe  they
were  at  a  distinct  performance  disadvantage  when  in  fact
they  were  not.  The  ploy  had  worked—a  classic  example
of  enhancing  self-confidence  to  achieve  excellence  (with
negative self-confidence and just a hint of doubt instilled in
the opponents, even in athletes who were used to competing
at the Olympic level).

Few  athletes  are  born  with  strong  self-confidence  and  an
ironclad  belief  system.  Rather,  belief  is  part  of  a  develop-
ing process that takes many years to mature. Athletes must
learn to overcome mental barriers. They must learn to be-
lieve their goals are possible. The personal trainer or coach
is absolutely essential for instilling a strong belief system in
the young athlete. The coach or personal trainer can be in-
strumental  in  the  athlete’s  development  of  self-confidence
and vision. You have to help the athlete develop short-term,
easily achieved goals. A strong belief system develops with a
series of small successes.

You must strive to make each athlete feel like you are there
for them and no one else. Tell them they are going to be suc-

cessful and make them believe you. Give them enough con-
fidence, and they will not worry about winning. They will
realize that if they train properly, they will achieve success.
This way, success becomes a natural extension of thorough
preparation and hard work.

Experience is the key to genuine self-confidence: experienced
athletes can put athletics in their proper perspective. They
know their capabilities better, and they are much better able
to deal with pain. They become students of their sport and
learn quite a bit about the theory behind training methods
and about the physiology and psychology of athletics. Newly
acquired  information  and  knowledge  combines  to  instill
confidence. Younger or less experienced athletes are usually
not very confident because they have not had enough time
to learn the sport.

Experienced  athletes,  almost  without  exception,  know
themselves  extremely  well.  Those  who  have  been  around
for  a  while  are  certainly  more  philosophical  about  their
sport; they have had more time to think and learn about it.
Almost  all  the  great  athletes  have  positive  attitudes.  Most
of them believe they are capable of anything in almost any
aspect of their life—not only in sports, but also in whatever
they  might  attempt.  They  are  extreme  optimists.  Great
athletes extend their belief and positive self-image into their
performance—and they win because of it.

International Sports Sciences Association242  |  unit 17

vISIon
Vision  is  knowing  what  you  want  to  achieve.  Many
potentially great athletes never make it because their vision
was not strong enough. Vision, like self-confidence, takes a
long time to develop; in fact, the two things go hand in hand.
John  Powell  related  a  recent  experience  of  a  young  long-
jumper  who  told  him  he  was  going  to  make  the  Olympic
team and break the world record. He was jumping only 23
feet at the time. Powell asked him, “Why don’t you shoot for
23 feet-6 inches before dreaming about winning an Olympic
gold  medal?”  He  was  not  being  realistic—pie-in-the-sky
beliefs lead many athletes into early retirement. The young
man did not realize that vision is built upon a series of small
steps. As you learn your capabilities, you adjust your goals
accordingly. I think it is important to enjoy the process of
development. Reaching the Olympics is a hollow victory if
you did not enjoy the trip “up.”

Vision involves not only identifying goals, but also accepting
what  is  necessary  to  achieve  them.  Champions  are  often
described as having a “killer instinct.” That instinct may be
the  special  something  that  provides  that  extra  margin  for
victory. Whether this inner drive is inborn or inbred is not
known; however, it is an important ingredient in vision.

In his autobiography First Four Minutes, first sub-4-minute
miler  Roger  Bannister  described  the  mental  attributes
of  John  Landy,  the  great  miler  from  Australia;  “Landy
demonstrated a character capable of the greatest kindness,
gentleness  and  thoughtfulness,  and  on  the  other  side—as
there always must be—a ruthless lack of feeling for others
and a ferocity and antagonism, although it is mostly vented
on himself, that makes it possible on occasions for John to
rise to sublime heights of physical endeavor.”

During  the  early  stages  of  an  athlete’s  career,  vision  can
come from a variety of places—parents, coaches, personal

Youth FitnessPsychology of the Champion  |  243

trainers, and other athletes. However, the time must come
when  an  athlete’s  goals  are  inner-motivated.  The  training
is  too  hard,  the  competition  too  stiff,  and  the  stress  too
great for anything but intrinsic incentive. A world-class or
professional athlete will seldom make it to the top because
of trying to win for parents, coaches, or even her country.
These things may be factors in motivation, but in the end
each athlete must want more than anything to succeed for
himself or herself.

meThod
Method is the process of achieving vision. Most people are
familiar  with  the  physical  methods  of  athletics:  obviously,
consistent dedication to hard work is necessary to achieve
elite-level  success.  Mental  agility  also  is  necessary  for
that  kind  of  achievement.  Efficient  training  programs,
competitive  tactics,  an  athlete’s  coachability,  and  the
ability  to  employ  psyching  techniques  are  all  part  of  the
psychological aspect of athletics.

John  Powell  discussed  his  method:  “Self-confidence  and
vision mean nothing if you can’t deliver the goods. Athletics
are so competitive that to be successful, you have to use your
practice time effectively. You can’t leave anything to chance.
I analyze every aspect of my technique and physical capacity.
I try to maximize all the strengths I have. There are a lot of
athletes who are much stronger than I, and the only way I
can beat them is by having better technique and by being
as  fast  as  possible  in  the  circle.  Changing  your  technique,
even by nuances, takes years; I will work on something until
I’ve mastered it. I feel that I have the best technique of the
world  class  throwers—I  have  to  because  they’re  all  bigger
and stronger than I am.”

Powell went on to say, “A lot of athletes aren’t as successful
as they could be because they don’t think. They tend to work
on their strong points rather than develop their weaknesses.
I  see  some  discus  throwers  who  can  bench  press  almost
600 pounds concentrating on gaining upper body strength
when they should be working on their throwing. They have
plenty of strength—what they need to do is work on their
poor technique.”

The  successful  champion  must  be  able  to  adjust  to  many
conditions  and  employ  many  different  strategies  and
methods  of  achieving  the  same  end—victory.  This  ability
was aptly described by distance running great Ron Clarke
who  said:  “The  distance  running  champion  who  sets  a
world record has to have a tough psychological approach to
his running. The Olympic, European, and Commonwealth
meets are harder to win than other meets because there are
more  people  with  similar  ability  who  may  just  happen  to
click under the tactics you use. When you can concentrate

on  dropping off just three or  four people in  a race,  you’re
almost  certainly  going  to  beat  them.  But  when  there  are
maybe a dozen people all around the same standard, your
tactics to defeat three or four may not fit so many. This is
what often happens in the big ones nowadays.”

Method relates to belief and vision: the ability and daring
to try certain strategies and tactics depends on an athlete’s
self-confidence  and  goals.  In  First  Four  Minutes,  Roger
Bannister shows this relationship as he describes a runner’s
decision to break from the pack and sprint to victory: “The
decision to break away results from a mixture of confidence
and  lack  of  it.  The  breaker  is  confident  to  the  extent  that
he suddenly decides the speed has become slower than he
can  himself  sustain  to  the  finish.  Hence  he  can  accelerate
suddenly  and  maintain  his  new  speed  to  the  tape.  But  he
also lacks confidence, feeling that unless he makes a move
now, everyone else will do so and he will be left standing.”

Bryan  Clay,  decathlon  gold  medalist  in  the  Beijing  Olym-
pics, had all of the psychological prerequisites for success.
Bryan is a master technician who approaches the decathlon
meticulously. He weight trains from 7 to 9 A.M., visits with
his wife and children from 9 to 10 A.M., and then trains for
his events from 11 A.M to 3 P.M. He spends hours watching
videos of great athletes in each of the ten events and com-
pares them with his own technique. He makes changes and
then watches more videos. His strongest events are the 100
meters, long jump, 110-meter hurdles, shot-put, and discus,
but his technique is excellent in all the events. His basic ap-
proach to sports training is a good blueprint for any athlete:

Stay  healthy.  Sports  requires  fitness  and  specific  skills.
Pushing  too  hard  before  the  body  is  ready  will  cause  in-
jury. Young athletes should use good body mechanics and
try to maintain good posture and a neutral spine when they

International Sports Sciences Association244  |  unit 17

lift,  run,  throw,  jump,  and  sprint.  Good  technique  doesn’t
hurt. Also, they should not train intensely before the body is
ready. The easiest way to get injured is to train too hard, too
fast. Most sports injuries are training errors.

keep a training diary, which includes a structured program
for the next six to eight weeks, details of the training pro-
gram,  and  specific  goals  and  objectives.  A  training  diary
might consist of little more than a spiral-bound notebook.

Get in shape gradually. Peak performance in sports takes
years. Children should give their bodies a chance to adapt
to  the  rigors  of  training  when  attempting  to  build  general
fitness.  This  takes  time;  children  do  not  increase  strength,
power, endurance, and speed overnight. The body adapts at
its own rate and changes occur naturally as individuals grow.

Plan  the  program  meticulously.  The  trainer  should  help
the child develop a maturationally appropriate, structured,
scientifically based training program that improves perfor-
mance  progressively.  The  same  is  true  for  children  trying
to  develop  well-rounded  fitness.  Structure  the  program  to
emphasize specific types of fitness on different days. In high
skill sports such as tennis or volleyball, schedule activities
so that the fitness program compliments skill development
rather than inerferes with it.

All  serious  athletes  keep  a  training  diary—a  detailed
account of their training program, diet, and performances.
Young  athletes  who  are  serious  about  their  sport  should

Try  to  make  greater  gains  with  less  work.  Great  athletes
have economical training programs. Children can develop
well-rounded fitness using one to two-hour workouts if the
program is structured intelligently.

Work out consistently. Ninety percent of success in life is
showing up. That certainly applies for improving fitness and
sports performance. Young athletes should try not to miss
workouts and should include planned rest days.

Develop the mental toughness of a champion.  Elite  ath-
letes are extremely disciplined. They train even when they
are sore and tired. Young athletes should develop the mental
toughness to exercise and train, even when they do not feel
like it. A workout that seems impossible today will be easy
after several months of training.

Belief, vision, and method remain inseparable. Each serves
as an essential ingredient in the formula for athletic success,
and  together  they  comprise  the  inner  drive  of  the  true
champion. Although these character traits are hereditary to

Youth FitnessPsychology of the Champion  |  245

a degree, they can be developed to their fullest only through
single-minded  devotion  to  sports  and  perseverance—a
lifetime  of  perseverance.  In  reality,  athletic  champions
are  no  different  from  men  and  women  who  make  great
fortunes  in  the  business  world:  athletes  and  professional
people  alike  must  have  tremendous  focus  and  tenacity  to
succeed.  But  while  business  offers  the  lure  of  money  and
power, in sports these are only secondary. The real reward
of athletic excellence is less tangible. Even participation in
a  field  of  extraordinarily  talented,  intensely  competitive
athletes is a goal in itself. But for one athlete to weather the
competition and rise to victory against all the opponents—

that  is  something  else  again.  Olympic  gold  medal  winner
Bruce  Jenner  described  it  best  when  he  said  that  winning
the decathlon brought him a special kind of satisfaction: “It
was everything.”

SuMMARY

Competitiveness includes building high levels of skill, learning to overcome adversity, setting short-term and long
term goals, learning to win and lose with grace, learning from defeats, and striving for success. The personal trainer
can help children begin to develop the mental attitude it takes to succeed in sport. Every child cannot make the
Olympic team; but every child can learn to think like a winner.

Sports psychologists have studied successful athletes in great detail and have found—with a few remarkable excep-
tions—that champion-level athletes are extremely stabile emotionally. The psychological tenacity necessary for
success in sports can be broken down into three simple factors: belief, vision, and method. Belief is self-confidence,
knowing your worth as an athlete and knowing you can do well. Vision is your goal. You have to know what you
want in order to achieve it. Method is the process you use to fulfill your vision—how you train and how you handle
yourself in the pressure and excitement of competition. The champion must be able to adjust to many conditions
and employ many different strategies and methods to achieve success. Athletic champions are no different from
men and women who make great fortunes in the business world: athletes and professional people alike must have
tremendous focus and tenacity to succeed.

Nutrition is even more important to children than it is to adults. Not only do they have to
eat nutritious meals that provide energy and keep them disease-free, but their meals must
also supply the building blocks for growth. The personal trainer must give information
that helps the child perform better on the playing field, while considering the nutritional
demands of growth.

Every day, we are flooded with myriad pieces of dietary information seeking to improve
our eating habits. Dietary information on food containers lists the nutritional contents
of the foods we eat. Diet books preach the latest weight loss methods. Sports nutrition
companies  try  to  sell  the  latest  formula  “guaranteed”  to  improve  performance.  Such
information  is  confusing.  Personal  trainers  need  to  know  the  principles  of  basic
nutrition and weight control in order to help young clients in this critical area of health
and  performance.  Dietary  information  is  important  because  good  nutrition  lays  the
foundation for health, appearance, and performance.

Poor diet is linked to many degenerative diseases. Proper diet can help to prevent many
health problems such as coronary heart disease, some cancers, diabetes, and obesity.
Nutritional factors such as dietary fat, fiber, and vitamins greatly affect health, longevity,
and well being.

Most people desire a healthy, lean looking body. You probably will never achieve this goal
unless you pay attention to the foods you consume. If you eat a lot of high density, fatty
foods, it will be difficult to achieve the kind of body you want—no matter how much
you exercise. You must combine sensible eating and exercise habits to achieve the kind
of body you want.

Sports and exercise performance depends on good nutrition. The energy to run, jump,
throw, and even rest comes from the foods we consume. Active young athletes need a
good  diet  to  exercise  and  play  sports  effectively.  Knowing  what  to  eat  and  when  can
determine whether you are running on empty during the day or have plenty of energy
to work and play.

Many  young  athletes  search  for  a  magic  nutritional  formula  to  help  them  feel  and
perform better and control their weight. Consequently, they often take food supplements
and  drugs  in  the  hope  of  reaching  their  goals.  The  performance  nutrition  industry  is
extremely  competitive  and  markets  a  wide  variety  of  products  that  promise  to  build
muscle,  enhance  performance,  and  help  people  attain  the  perfect  body.  How  do  you
separate reality from hype?

This section of the course presents an overview of nutritional principles for health and
performance. Topics include the elements of the healthy, high performance diet, diet and
weight control, food supplements, and performance enhancing drugs.

ESSENTIAL NuTRIENTS
The six types of essential nutrients you need in your diet include fats, carbohydrates,
proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water. The body either does not produce these or
makes them in insufficient quantities. You must include each component in your diet to
stay alive and healthy.

The body derives energy from fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, while vitamins, minerals,
and water help to regulate energy processes in your body. Nutrients drive metabolism—
the  total  of  all  the  chemical  reactions  occurring  in  your  body.  Running,  jumping,
throwing, skiing, skipping, lifting, and walking all require energy. This energy is supplied
by food. Proteins and fats also help to create body structures such as muscle, bone, and
cell membranes.

energY
The ability to convert chemical energy from fuels to muscle energy (muscle contraction)
largely determines exercise performance. As you deplete your body’s energy stores, you
fatigue  rapidly,  and  performance  decreases.  Active  people  fight  fatigue  by  consuming
enough  high-quality  calories  in  their  diet  and  restoring  vital  energy  stores  in  muscles
and the liver. Children always seem to work at a high energy level, so they need to eat a
high performance diet.

Fats  provide  the  most  energy,  9  kcal  (calories,  usually  expressed  as  kilocalories)  per
gram, while carbohydrates and proteins each supply 4 kcal per gram. Alcohol, which is
not an essential nutrient, supplies 7 kcal per gram. During the past 20+ years, experts
have advised people to cut down on the fats they eat. High fat diets, in addition to being
high in calories, also increase the risk for a variety of diseases. New studies show that
people lose weight faster on low carbohydrate–high fat, protein diets. While that may
be  true,  such  diets  are  inappropriate  for  children  involved  in  sport  or  high  intensity
exercise programs.

Children’s energy requirements vary with age. Between ages 7 and 9 years, the average
child should eat about 1800 kcal per day. This jumps to 2100 kcal between ages 10 and
12, moves to 2500 kcal for boys and 2200 kcal for girls from ages 13 to 15 years, and rises
to 2200 kcal for girls and 3000 kcal for boys from ages 16 to 18. Of course, the caloric
requirement will be higher if the child plays high-energy sports.

On any given day, the average adult requires about 2200 kcal. Adults who are more active
or larger than normal need more calories—2800 kcal or more for women and 3400 kcal
for men. When you take in more calories than you use through metabolism or exercise,
excess calories are stored as fat.

Energy intake is important, even among people trying to lose weight. Starving yourself
and over-exercising can adversely affect health, decrease performance, and make you feel
miserable. When trying to lose weight, the best strategy is to decrease your caloric intake
slightly so weight is lost slowly. Weight loss principles are discussed later in this unit.

Most  people  take  in  more  than  enough  energy  to  supply  their  daily  physical  needs.
Over  eating  and  under  exercising  are  main  reasons  why  more  than  one-half  of  the
United States adult population is overweight. Under-consumption can be a problem in

fats: Storage lipids in animal
tissues. The primary compo-
nents are triglyceride esters of
long chain fatty acids.

carbohydrates: Major energy
providing substrates including
starches, sugars, cellulose and
hemicellulose. All carbohydrates
contain carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, and are usually divided
into two fractions—structural
(fiber) and non-structural (sug-
ars and starches).

proteins: Naturally-occurring
compounds containing nitro-
gen, carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen, and sometimes sulfur or
phosphorus. Proteins are made
up of complex combinations of
amino acids and are essential for
animal growth, production, and
reproduction.

vitamins: Organic compounds
that function as parts of enzyme
systems essential for many
metabolic functions.

minerals: Inorganic food ele-
ments essential for life.

calorie: A measure of energy;
usually expressed as kilocalorie
(kcal). 1 kcal = the amount of
energy required to increase the
temperature of 1 liter of water 1
degree C.

extremely active people. Nutritional studies of athletes show that the majority of them
do not consume enough calories. Calories are the most important nutritional factor for
exercise  performance.  Inadequate  caloric  intake  can  lead  to  loss  of  body  weight  and
muscle mass, depletion of carbohydrate stores in the muscles and liver, and sometimes
low blood sugar during training. This can be a critical concern in children because they
will have insufficient energy to supply the body’s energy needs for sports or growth.

FaTS
Fats are the most energy rich food source. Fats—also called lipids—are mainly found in
adipocytes (fat cells). The body also stores small amounts of fat in skeletal muscle cells.
Many people try to carry as little fat as possible. However, it is far from being a useless
tissue—it serves as the body’s main energy storage depot. Fat cells release chemicals, such

adipocytes: Specialized cells
that makes and store fat.

cell membrane: Structure
surrounding a cell and enclosing
the cytoplasm that forms a bar-
rier that allows some substances,
such as oxygen, fuels, and
wastes, through its walls. It is
made of fats, proteins and some
carbohydrates.

triglycerides: Storage fats in
adipose tissue, largely made of
glycerol and fatty acids.

saturated fat: Fatty acid with
all potential hydrogen binding
sites filled. These pose the high-
est risk for the development of
atherosclerosis.

monounsaturated fat: Fatty
acid chain with at least two
empty spaces where a hydrogen
atom could be added. Saturated
fatty acids present a greater
health risk for the development
of coronary artery disease.

polyunsaturated fat: Fat that
contains more than one carbon-
carbon double bond.

as leptin, that help regulate appetite and metabolic rate. Fat also protects and insulates
the  internal  organs,  comprises  part  of  vital  structures  such  as  cell  membranes,  and
serves  as  building  blocks  for  many  important  hormones.  Dietary  fats  help  to  absorb
some vitamins and serve as a vital energy source for most tissues. They help to regulate
several important body functions, such as blood pressure, and are critical for optimal
fetal development during pregnancy.

While there are several types of fats, the most important are triglycerides and cholesterol.
Triglycerides  are  composed  of  glycerol  and  three  fatty  acid  molecules.  Fatty  acids
are  classified  according  to  their  structure  as  saturated,  monounsaturated,  or
polyunsaturated. Fats are called “saturated” if they contain high amounts of saturated
fatty  acids.  Foods  high  in  saturated  fat  include  meats,  such  as  hamburger  and  steak;
lunchmeats;  cheese;  butter;  and  whole  milk.  Monounsaturated  and  polyunsaturated
fats come from plants such as olives, peanuts, corn, soybeans, and sunflowers. Palm and
coconut oil, although from plant sources, are highly saturated. Food manufacturers can
also  “partially  hydrogenate”  vegetable  fats,  which  produces  trans  fats.  They  do  this  to
improve  the  texture  of  food  and  to  increase  the  shelf  life  of  their  products.  Trans  fats
contain  no  essential  fatty  acids,  and  consuming  them  increases  the  risk  of  coronary
artery disease. Several countries and several US states and cities have banned the use of
trans fats in preparing restaurant foods.

Youth FitnessNutrition for health and Performance  |  253

Most people consume 30 to 40 percent of their calories as fat. The body needs only a
fraction of this—about a tablespoon of vegetable oil a day. The high fat diet increases
serum  cholesterol,  a  leading  risk  factor  for  coronary  heart  disease  and  some  types  of
cancer.  Nutritionists  recommend  that  fat  intake  be  less  than  30  percent  of  calories
consumed; some recommend even lower levels of fat intake.

Children  should  restrict  the  amount  of  saturated  and  trans  fats  in  the  diet.  Better  fat
sources include  olive oil,  high in monounsaturated fatty acids,  and  most  kinds of fish
(e.g., salmon, trout, and mackerel), which are high in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty
acids are thought to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

Consumer  information on food  containers  makes  it  relatively  easy  to  track  fat  intake.
The most important thing to look for on the label is percent of calories from fat. Total fat
intake for children 4 to 18 years of age should be between 30 to 35 percent of calories,
emphasizing  polyunsaturated  and  monounsaturated  fatty  acids  in  foods  such  as  fish,
nuts, and vegetable oils. Moderation is the key. If one food or meal contains more fat
than is desirable, balance it with food or a meal containing less than 30 to 35 percent fat.

carbohYdraTeS
Carbohydrates are the high performance fuel. They are the most important energy source
during exercise. Also, the brain, nervous system, and blood cells depend on them as their
fuel source. Your capacity for exercise and mental processing diminish quickly when you
run out of this critical fuel.

Carbohydrates are classified as simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates contain only
one to two sugar units per molecule, while complex carbohydrates consist of long chains of
sugar molecules. Sweet-tasting foods such as table sugar and honey are examples of simple
carbohydrates, while high fiber foods—such as fruits, some vegetables, and grains—are
complex carbohydrates. A diet high in dietary fiber is essential to good gastrointestinal
health and the prevention of colon cancer. Nutritional experts recommend an emphasis
on complex carbohydrates in the diet.

The  body  controls  blood  sugar  levels  by  absorbing  carbohydrates  from  food  and  by
breaking down stored carbohydrates. The latter process is particularly important when
you  need  energy  quickly,  especially  during  exercise.  Important  hormones,  including
insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine (adrenaline), control blood sugar. These hormones
activate when the energy level of your body changes, such after you have eaten a meal
or during exercise. While these hormones are critical to blood sugar regulation, they are
ineffective unless they have fuels to work with. The body gets the carbohydrates it needs
through the diet.

Carbohydrates are stored in cells as glycogen, which is a mass of blood sugar (glucose)
units linked together. The liver and muscles store most of the body’s glycogen. During
exercise, the most important carbohydrate source for muscular work is muscle glycogen.
The  body  uses  approximately  six  times  more  muscle  glycogen  than  blood  sugar  to
run, ride a bicycle, or lift weights. However, blood  sugar  is  important because it fuels
the  nervous  system.  Motivation  suffers  without  a  well-functioning  brain  and  nervous
system—no matter how much glycogen is stored in the muscles. Children should not
neglect  blood  sugar  when  considering  which  fuels  the  body  will  use  during  exercise.
Muscle  glycogen  may  provide  most  of  the  fuel  for  muscle  movements,  but  the  blood
glucose supplies the brain and nervous system.

Blood  sugar  can  also  be  manufactured  in  the  liver  from  substances  such  as  amino
acids,  lactate  (lactic  acid  without  the  acid),  and  pyruvate.  This  process  is  called

glycogen: Compound consist-
ing of grouped glucose units
that is an important fuel source
for high intensity exercise. It is
found in high quantities in the
liver and muscles.

amino acids: Nitrogen-con-
taining compounds that serve as
building blocks for proteins.

lactate: Important as the
terminal product of anaerobic
glycolysis (breakdown of glu-
cose or blood sugar). It is a very
important fuel for the body, but
it can interfere with metabolism
and cause fatigue.

pyruvate: Important as a
product of anaerobic glycolysis
(breakdown of glucose or blood
sugar).

International Sports Sciences Association254  |  unit 18

gluconeogenesis: Chemical
process in the liver that converts
chemicals, such as lactate, pyru-
vate, and alanine, into glucose.

gluconeogenesis.  Fuel  sources  flowing  into  the  liver  via  the  blood  stream  enter  the
liver  where  it  converts  them  into  blood  sugar.  Through  this  process  and  by  breaking
down  liver  glycogen,  your  body
can  maintain  reasonably  high
levels  of  blood  sugar,  even  during
prolonged fasting.

During  exercise,  blood
sugar
control  processes  allow  blood
sugar  to  increase.  If  you  begin
an  exercise  session  with
full
glycogen  stores  in  your  liver,  you
can  maintain  elevated  levels  of
blood sugar (compared to rest) for
several  hours  of  exercise  before  it
begins to decline.

Unfortunately,  the  liver’s  storage
capacity is limited. When you’re on
a prolonged hard training program and don’t eat enough calories or carbohydrates, liver
glycogen stores can run low. Studies of athletes involved in heavy training show that due
to poor diet, liver glycogen levels are often inadequate. High carbohydrate diets are best
for maintaining adequate glycogen stores in the liver. Eating a good breakfast is the best
way of replenishing liver stores after the long night without any fuel intake.

ProTeInS
Proteins are the body’s most important structural material, making up much of its muscle,
bone, enzymes, some hormones, and cell membranes. Proteins are made of substances
called amino acids. Of the twenty amino acids in foods, nine are considered essential
in the diet because the body can’t make them. Essential amino acids include histidine,
isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, theonine, tryptophan, and valine.

Protein supplements are very popular with active young athletes, particularly those who
lift weights. However, most people take in much more protein than they need. The daily
protein requirement is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. People who are
extremely active may need slightly more protein. However, since most American athletes
consume more than 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram body weight, a protein deficit in
the  diet  is  rarely  a  problem.  Active  children  need  plenty  of  protein—about  1.5  grams
per kilogram body weight—because they must supply the demands for growth and the
protein  requirements  for  exercise
and post-exercise tissue building.

Proteins  are  important  for  people
involved  in  endurance  exercise.
The
liver  can  convert  amino
acids  to  blood  sugar  through  a
process  called  gluconeogenesis.
This  term  literally  means  making
new  glucose  or  blood  sugar.
Gluconeogenesis  is  an  important
way  the  body  maintains  blood
sugar during the hours in between
meals.  Amino  acids,  the  building

Youth FitnessNutrition for health and Performance  |  255

blocks of proteins, break down slowly and act like “time-released blood sugar tablets.”
The  proteins  in  your  meals  helps  maintain  blood  sugar  for  many  hours  and  prevent
hunger sensations.

Amino acid use during exercise, particularly of the branched chain amino acids leucine,
isoleucine, and valine, increases the longer and faster you exercise. Protein in your meals
can help restore depleted amino acids.

Eating a protein supplement before or immediately after weight training increases the
rate at which amino acids travel into the muscle and speeds the rate at which muscles
build new protein. Have the athlete get into the habit of eating a protein energy bar (made
by many companies) before or after weight training. This is a simple sports nutrition tool
that promotes protein synthesis.

vITamInS and mIneralS
Americans spend an incredible amount of money on vitamin and mineral pills. Yet, the
only common documented deficiency in the United States is iron deficiency. It appears
that  with  a  couple  of  possible
exceptions,  anything  more  than  a
balanced diet and, perhaps, a basic
vitamin pill is useless and a waste
of money.

Vitamins act as co-enzymes (they
work  with  enzymes
to  drive
body’s  metabolism)  and  aid  in
production  and  protection  of  red
cells.  While  vitamins  are  not  produced  in  the  body  and  must

Vitamin C supplementation has been a fertile area of debate since Linus Pauling suggested
mega-doses  of  the  vitamin  as  a  cure  for  the  common  cold.  His  contention  has  been
extremely controversial, and, in general, medical studies have not supported his claims.
Recent studies have shown a link between vitamin C intake and immune function. This
could  be  good  news  for  active  people  because  preventing  the  down-time  from  illness
can be just as effective as discovering a new ergogenic aid to enhance performance. It is
certain that the debate regarding vitamin C and health will continued for many years.

Also,  consuming  additional  vitamin  C
may  be  recommended  in  case  it  really
does  boost  immune  function.  As  long
as excessive amounts of the vitamin are not consumed, the extra vitamin C
probably won’t hurt. However, there does not appear to be any justification for
the mega-doses of vitamins taken by many athletes and active people.

free radicals: HIghly reactive
molecules which target your tis-
sue’s protein bonds, the DNA in
your cells’ nuclei and the impor-
tant polyunsaturated fatty acids
within your cells’ membranes.
Once initiated, a chain reaction
begins that ultimately results in
the total destruction of that cell.

Vitamins C and E may also help protect the body from destructive chemicals called free
radicals. During normal metabolism, your body produces chemicals called free radicals
that cause aging, degenerative diseases, and a breakdown of the immune system. Free
radicals can be thought of as biological rust that attacks vital cell membranes and genes.
Substances  called  antioxidants  fight  free  radicals  and  help  prevent  aging  and  diseases
such as hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Vitamins C and E act as antioxidants
that  help  eliminate  free  radicals  and  protect  your  body  from  their  destructive  effects.
Scientists  are  just  starting  to  learn  about  the  relationship  between  vitamins  and  free
radicals.

waTer
Water  makes  up  sixty  percent  of  the  body.  It  is  vitally  important  for  controlling  your
metabolism, digesting food, delivering substances to your cells, cellular communication,
and temperature regulation. Even a two percent drop in body water will affect exercise
performance—particularly in children.

In addition to plain water, water is found in almost all foods, particularly fruits, vegetables,
and liquids. While your body can make water as part of metabolism, 80 to 90 percent of
daily  water  turnover  comes  from  your  diet.  You  lose  water  every  day  in  urine,  sweat,
feces, and evaporation from the lungs.

Water  and  salt  intake  affects  your  body  water.  Your  body  divides  its  water  between
cells, blood, and the area outside the cells. Dehydration upsets the balance and disrupts
communication between different parts of the body and results in poor coordination and
muscle stiffness. The body also loses salt from sweating. This can cause muscle cramps
because dehydration speeds muscle fatigue—the leading cause of cramps.

The best fluid replacement beverage is cold and contains some energy and electrolytes.
Most  commercially  available  fluid  replacement  products  are  specially  formulated  for
athletes and active people. Athletes should attempt to replace fluid losses during exercise.
During  recovery,  weight  lost  through  dehydration  should  be  repaired  before  the  next
practice or competition.

ThE hEALThY, hIgh-PERFORMANCE DIET AND MYPLATE
•  Grains: 6 oz; at least 3 oz should come from
The  basic  principles  of  good  nutrition  include  eating  a
variety  of  foods,  eating  a  balanced  diet,  and  eating  in
moderation. It is difficult to improve upon sensible eating
habits for maximizing the effects of a fitness program and
maintaining a trim, attractive body.

Fruits: 2 cups per day from a variety of sources

In  2010,  the  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture
and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services
issued dietary guidelines for healthy Americans. The report
stated,  “On  average,  Americans  of  all  ages  consume  too
few vegetables, fruits, high-fiber whole grains, low-fat milk
and  milk  products,  and  seafood  and  they  eat  too  much
added  sugars,  solid  fats,  refined  grains,  and  sodium.”  The
organization  made  several  important  recommendations
and goals that apply to children:

•  Reduce the incidence and prevalence of over-

weight and obesity of the US population by re-
ducing overall calorie intake and increasing physi-
cal activity. Children should reduce consumption
of high sugar soft drinks, grain deserts, solid fats,
and foods containing added sugar.

•

•

Shift food intake patterns to a more plant-based
diet that emphasizes vegetables, cooked dry
beans and peas, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and
seeds. In addition, increase the intake of seafood
and fat-free and low-fat milk and milk products
and consume only moderate amounts of lean
meats, poultry, and eggs.

Significantly reduce intake of foods containing
added sugars and solid fats because these dietary
components contribute excess calories and few, if
any, nutrients. In addition, reduce sodium intake
and lower intake of refined grains, especially
refined grains that are coupled with added sugar,
solid fat, and sodium.

•  Meet the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for

Americans. Children age 6 to 18 years old should
exercise 60 minutes or more every day—includ-
ing mostly moderate or vigorous intensity aerobic
exercise. Children and adolescents should do
vigorous-intensity activity on at least three days
per week and do muscle-strengthening and bone-
strengthening activity on at least three days per
week.

In  2011  the  guidelines  included  “MyPlate”,  suggests  the
elements  of  a  well–balanced  diet.  The  healthy  diet  plays
a  critical  role  in  any  fitness–nutrition  program.  The  diet
provides  all  of  the  known  nutrients,  reduces  the  risk  of
coronary  artery  disease  and  some  types  of  cancer,  and
provides  enough  energy  to  sustain  a  vigorous  training
program. The balanced diet consists of at least three meals a
day of foods chosen from five basic food groups (quantities
from 2000 kcal per day diet):

•  Meat and beans: 5 1/2 oz per day from low-fat or

•  Milk, yogurt, and cheese: 3 cups from low fat or
non-fat sources (2 cups for kids ages 2 to 8)

MyPlate was designed to persuade people to eat fewer meat
and dairy products containing cholesterol and saturated fats
and to eat more cereals, grains, fruits, and vegetables. The well-
balanced diet suggested in the pyramid provides all known
nutritional  requirements  and  satisfies  the  Recommended
Daily Allowances (RDA) for important nutrients. Because
it is possible that all nutritional requirements have not been
identified, people should consume a variety of foods from
the basic food groups. Remember, all the food supplements
in the world are not going to make up for a poor diet. You
cannot get optimal nutrition from a pill!

Milk and milk products are important sources of calcium,
riboflavin,  high-quality  protein,  carbohydrate,  fat,  and
other assorted vitamins and minerals. Protein foods, such
as meats, chicken, and fish, in addition to providing protein,
also  supply  iron,  thiamin,  riboflavin,  niacin,  phosphorus,
and zinc. Avoid eating meats with a high fat content because
they are associated with increased risk of heart disease.

Whole  grain  foods  supply  energy,  thiamin,  iron,  niacin,
and cellulose (fiber). These foods are critical for satisfying
the  energy  requirements  of  a  vigorous  exercise  program.
Fruit and vegetables are important for supplying vitamins,
minerals, and fiber. It is particularly important to eat dark
green  and  deep  yellow  vegetables  because  of  their  high
nutrient content and their possible influence in reducing the
risk of certain types of cancer.

DIET, ExERCISE, AND WEIghT CONTROL
The goal when advising young athletes about losing weight
is to encourage them to maintain muscle mass and lose fat.
This  is  not  as  easy  as  it  sounds.  Most  people  want  instant
results. Children may try to lose weight lose in any way they
can—particularly  girls  and  young  women.  Unfortunately,
the  results  are  rarely  satisfactory  when  people  try  to  lose
weight rapidly.

Rapid weight loss causes muscle loss. When a person loses
more  than  three  pounds  a  week,  40  to  50  percent  of  the
that  will  be  from  lean  body  mass.  Your  muscles  are  being
used for food by your starving body. That is the last thing
children need when trying to develop a fit, healthy body.

PrIncIPleS oF loSIng
weIghT For acTIve PeoPle
Weight loss is a worldwide obsession. Many older children
exercise in the hope of keeping their waistline under control.
However, a program that depends solely on exercise or diet
is doomed to failure in the long run. Individuals must eat a
healthy diet and exercise regularly if they are to achieve a fit,
healthy looking body.

program  demands  caloric  restriction.  Exercise  alone  is
rarely  effective.  Fat  loss  occurs  when  expended  energy
exceeds food intake.

The goal of a weight control program should be to lose body
fat and maintain the loss. Quick-loss programs often result
in the loss of muscle tissue and do nothing to instill healthy
long-term dietary habits that will maintain the new weight.
Also, “yo-yo” diets are unhealthy and contribute to coronary
heart  disease.  There  are  several  principles  for  losing  body
fat that will increase the chances of success for your weight
control program.

Avoid Fad Diets
Rapid weight loss from fad diets usually causes loss of muscle
mass and water. Therefore, fat loss rather than weight loss
should  be  the  goal.  Each  pound  of  fat  has  3500  kcal.  The
energy requirement of the average active person (depending
on size, sex, and activity level) is typically between 2000 and
5000 kcal per day. Fat loss occurs slowly, even on starvation
diets.  Radical  diets  cause  more  than  fat  loss—they  also
trigger muscle and water loses too.

The  body’s  energy  balance  determines  whether  body  fat
increases,  decreases,  or  remains  the  same.  Kids  gain  fat
when they eat more energy through meals than they burn
through  exercise  and  metabolism.  While  exercise  is  an
important part of a weight control program, the successful

Lose Weight Slowly
Lose no more than 1 kg (2.2 lb) per week. More rapid weight
loss results in the loss of lean tissue. Creating a mild caloric
deficit  through  moderate  caloric  restriction  and  physical

activity  promotes  fat  loss  and  preserves  muscle  or  water.
The weight stays off better. Muscle loss slows metabolism,
which  reduces  the  need  for  food.  When  people  return  to
their normal diet after having lost muscle through a rapid-
weight-loss diet, they gain weight rapidly because they no
longer need as much food as before.

type exercise. Studies have also shown that fats break down
faster during the post-exercise period after a high intensity
exercise work out. High intensity exercise also builds muscle
mass more than slow endurance training. The bottom line is
that both prolonged endurance and high intensity exercise
are beneficial for weight control in overweight children.

Stress  a  balanced  diet  that  is  relatively  high  in  complex
carbohydrates  and  low  in  fat.  Create  a  caloric  deficit  by
combining  caloric  restriction  with  more  exercise.  Take  in
enough  protein  to  help  control  appetite  and  maintain  the
muscles’ needs. For active children, this is approximately 1.5
grams of protein per kilogram of body weight a day, a ratio
which helps sustain training and growth.

Exercise  is  critically  important  for  a  successful  weight
loss  program.  For  the  average  person,  the  best  exercises
for  losing  weight  include  running,  walking,  and  cycling.
Exercise increases your metabolism both  during and after
exercise, which causes you to burn calories at a faster rate
all  day  long.  Also,  exercise  helps  maintain  muscle  mass,
which is critical for maintaining metabolic rate. If you can
maintain your muscle mass during weight loss, you will be
much more likely to maintain your new weight.

The  best  exercises  for  promoting  fat  loss  are  prolonged
endurance  exercise.  However,  doing  intense  exercise  is
also beneficial. High intensity exercise increases your post
exercise metabolism more than doing long, slow endurance

Monitor Body Composition
Make sure that most of the weight loss is from a reduction
in  body  fat  rather  than  a  reduction  in  lean  body  mass.
The  best  way  to  do  this  is  with  an  underwater  weighing
or  BodPod  test.  These  are  widely  available  in  university
exercise physiology laboratories, health clubs, and medical
facilities.  Some  children  have  trouble  with  these  tests,  but
most  don’t.  Every  active  person  should  know  his  or  her
body composition.

If you don’t have access to underwater weighing or BodPod,
other  methods  are  available.  Perhaps  the  best  is  skin  fold
calipers. Almost every health club or high school physical
education department has these. Another popular methods
include  bioelectrical  impedance  and  infrared  methods.
These  techniques,  while  technologically  advanced,  are  no
more accurate than skinfolds. Use these techniques as guides
and rough indicators. The trained eye is just as effective in
evaluating body composition as sophisticated instruments.

International Sports Sciences Association262  |  unit 18

Avoid Weight Loss Aids
The  grocery  and  drug  store  shelves  are  full  of  weight  loss
products. Research has shown these over-the-counter drugs
are  largely  ineffective.  FDA  approved  weight  loss  drugs,
available  by  medical  prescription,  are  only  marginally
effective.  And  almost  all  the  patients  who  use  these  gain
back the weight they lost when they stop taking the drugs.
Also, the drugs have side effects, such as gas and abdominal
cramping. The best advice is to stay away from drugs that
promise to help you lose weight. They probably don’t work.
If they do, they may damage your health.

Only  orlistat  is  currently  approved  for  weight  loss  in  the
United  States,  but  it  is  expensive  and  can  have  a  negative
effect. Ephedrine-caffeine supplements were widely popular
with  young  athletes  for  boosting  energy  and  promoting
weight  loss,  but  were  banned  by  the  FDA  because  they
caused severe side effects.

The  best  strategy  for  body  composition  management  is  to
encourage young athletes to lose weight slowly. Teach them

to  change  their  body  composition  gradually  so  that  they
gain muscle and lose fat. Rapid weight loss cause muscle and
body water loss, which will impair health and performance.

The  effects  of  the  large  variety  and  combination  of
supplements  and  drugs  used  by  active  people  makes  it
extremely difficult to determine the efficacy of these products
or  to  predict  the  side  effects.  There  are  numerous  reports
in the literature that describe catastrophic side effects from
unsafe drug use and nutritional supplementation. Trainers
should  not  recommend  these  products  to  young  athletes
because we do not know much about their long-term side
effects or effectiveness. Children will get the best results by
following a sensible diet and training program and avoiding
dubious and potentially dangerous drugs and supplements.

SuMMARY

Sound nutrition is vital for physically active children because nutritious meals provide energy, prevent disease,
and supply the building blocks for growth. Active young athletes need a good diet to exercise and play sports
effectively. Knowing what to eat and when can determine whether they are running on empty during the day or
have plenty of energy to work and play.

The six types of essential nutrients children need in their diet include fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, min-
erals, and water. Children’s energy requirements vary with age. Between ages 7 and 9 years, the average child
should eat about 1800 kcal per day. This jumps to 2100 kcal from ages 10 to 12, move to 2500 kcal for boys
and 2200 kcal for girls from ages 13 to 15 years, and rises to 2200 kcal for girls and 3000 kcal for boys from ages
16 to 18. Children should restrict the amount of saturated and trans fats in the diet. Total fat intake for children
4 to 18 years of age should between 30 to 35 percent of calories, and emphasize polyunsaturated and mono-
unsaturated fatty acids in foods such as fish, nuts, and vegetable oils. Emphasize complex carbohydrates in the
diet. Active children need plenty of protein—about 1.5 grams per kilogram body weight—to supply their bodies’
demands for growth and the protein requirements for exercise and post-exercise tissue building. The US Depart-
ment of Agriculture, in a 2010 dietary guidelines report, stated: “On average, Americans of all ages consume
too few vegetables, fruits, high-fiber whole grains, low-fat milk and milk products, and seafood and they eat too
much added sugars, solid fats, refined grains, and sodium.” The guidelines included a “MyPlate” that suggested
the elements of a well–balanced diet.

Substances  taken  to  enhance  performance  are  called
ergogenic  aids.  Active  people  consume  a  wide  variety
of  drugs  and  nutritional  supplements  in  the  quest  for
improved  performance  and  the  “perfect  body.”  They  take
these  substances  to:  (1)  enhance  muscle  hypertrophy,  (2)

Sports, fitness, and bodybuilding have become very popular,
high profile activities—particularly in young people. Several
bodybuilding  champions  have  become  international  film
stars, and many make enormous sums of money endorsing
athletic  food  supplements.  The  majority  of  bodybuilding
and  fitness  magazines  serve  as  promotional  vehicles  for
“nutritional”  products  of  questionable  value.  As  aware,
educated fitness consumers, you should be able to separate

fact  from  fiction  in  evaluating  “performance  enhancing”  drugs
and food supplements. This section of the chapter reviews some
of the more popular drugs and food supplements used by active
people to promote appearance and performance.

EThICS OF ERgOgENIC AIDS
uSE IN ChILDREN’S SPORTS
Sports  supplements  and  drugs  are  minefields  for  the  personal
trainer—especially  when  working  with  young  people.  Many  of
these substances are banned for use in amateur and professional
sports.  Research  tells  us  little  about  the  effectiveness  and  long-
term  health  effects  of  these  substances  in  children.  The  trainer
must be aware of the latest information about these substances—
from the lab and from the street.

Personal  trainers  must  also  be  aware  of  the  ethical  dilemmas
posed  by  the  use  of  ergogenic  aids.  Many  successful  young
athletes  use  supplements  and  drugs.  Some  teenagers  use  them
to  improve  their  appearance.  The  personal  trainer  must  never  give  the  appearance  of
promoting or tolerating drug use. In addition to violating basic ethics of working with
young people, you run the risk of professional sanctions and arrest. You can be honest
about the effects of drugs on performance and health, but do not advocate using them.
Even supplements can be a problem. While most are safe and some are effective, you have
no control over product quality or the amount of supplements your athletes use. Some of
these substances are toxic at high levels. Many young athletes follow the philosophy that
if a little is good, more is better.

Is it ethical for young athletes to use legal supplements? Of course it is. However, the
trainer has to be very careful about recommending them. Discuss the pros and cons of
the products with the parents, and let them decide. That way, you will not be responsible
if the child has a side effect. It becomes a parent-child issue.

COMMON DRugS AND SuPPLEMENTS
AvAILAbLE TO YOuNg AThLETES
Young  athletes  can  get  almost  any  drug—even  if  they  live  in  rural  communities.  The
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has said that anabolic steroid seizures are a
low priority. People caught with small quantities of steroids at the border will have their
drugs confiscated, but the person will not be arrested. Also, athletes have easy access to
these drugs over the Internet. Some pharmacies in Mexico will mail the steroids from the
United States so there is little risk of seizure. The personal trainer should assume that the
drugs are available to any young athlete who has the money to pay for them.

Look for obvious signs of drug use such as sudden changes in behavior, unusual acne
breakouts, significant changes in body composition (increased muscle mass or decreased
fat), nosebleeds, and unusual increases in physical performance. Of course, these signs
do not necessarily mean the child is taking illegal drugs, but they should increase your
level of suspicion. Tables 19.1 and 19.2 list drugs and supplements popular with adult
and young athletes.

This category is of greatest concern to active people and constitutes the most significant
area of abuse. Personal trainers should never recommend that young athletes take ana-
bolic steroids. In addition to possible serious side effects, the drugs are illegal. Recom-
mending them could put the personal trainer in serious jeopardy with the law.

Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids
People take anabolic steroids (AS) in the hope of gaining weight, muscle size, strength,
power, speed, endurance, and aggressiveness. These drugs are widely used by both seri-
ous athletes and by active people trying to improve their appearance and performance

In the United States in 1990, the Anabolic Steroid Control Act classified anabolic steroids
as a Schedule III substance. The law gave the DEA power to restrict the importation, ex-
portation, distribution, and dispensing of anabolic steroids. The legislation was amended
in 2004 to include a ban on the sale of pro-hormones, such as androstenedione. This has
led to a thriving “black market” for illegal anabolic steroids in the United States.

AS increase protein synthesis, which enhances lean body mass. AS bind with receptor
molecules in the cells, which stimulates the cells to make proteins. They also interfere
with the activity of hormones that break down tissue after exercise, which helps steroid
users recover more quickly. AS may also increase aggressiveness, which allows athletes to
train harder. Recent studies show that steroids work better at higher dosages (more than
400 mg a week of testosterone). Unfortunately, the incidence of side effects increases with
increases in dosage.

hOW STEROIDS WORK IN ThE bODY
Increase in the Size and Perhaps the
Number of Muscle Cells
Steroids  make  muscles  larger,  but  they  also  have  several
effects that radically affect muscles’ strength, power, speed,
and  endurance.  Steroids  may  increase  the  number  of
muscle  fibers  or  hyperplasia.  Muscle  biopsies  of  trained
steroid-using weight lifters show they have larger and more
numerous muscle fibers than control subjects. Steroids may
turn  on  cell  structures  called  satellite  cells,  which  may
make  new  muscle  cells.  Most  top  muscle  physiologists  do
not believe that hyperplasia is important in making muscles
bigger.

Increased Androgen Receptor Activity
Steroids  work  by  binding  to  androgen  receptors  in  the
tissues. Scientists have said that taking high doses of steroids
is  ineffective  because  there  are  not  enough  androgen
receptors  to  accommodate  the  high  levels  of  testosterone.
The  activity  of  the  receptor  increases  in  the  face  of  high
blood  levels  of  testosterone.  Also,  intense  weight  training
increases receptor number and activity. Heavy training and
high doses of testosterone is the ticket to muscle growth.

An interesting finding was that receptor  density  is greater
in the upper body than in the lower body. This suggests that
steroids  may  be  more  effective  for  increasing  the  strength
and muscle mass of the pecs over the quads.

Increased Speed of Calcium Release
Power athletes—ranging from baseball players to Olympic
lifters—have  long  appreciated  the  effects  of  steroids  on
quickness and power. Calcium triggers muscle contraction.
Steroids increase the speed of calcium release and make the
muscle cells more sensitive to calcium. This means that the
muscles contract faster and more powerfully.

Anticatabolic Effects of Steroids
Muscle growth occurs when protein synthesis in the muscle
exceeds  breakdown.  If  you  can  slow  breakdown  after  a
workout,  the  athlete  makes  gains  by  having  only  a  small
amount of net protein synthesis. Animal studies show that

Youth FitnessErgogenic Aids: Drugs and Supplements  |  269

steroids  can  cross  bind  with  corticosteroid  binding  sites.
These catabolic hormones cause protein breakdown. High
doses  of  steroids  may  promote  cross  binding,  but  not  all
studies show that steroids have anticatabolic effects.

Steroids trigger growth hormone and muscle growth fac-
tors. They initiate growth hormone release from the brain
and IgF-1 (muscle growth factor) from the liver. They only
do this when the weekly dosage of anabolic steroids equals
400 mg per week. IGF-1 and GH are highly anabolic. Ath-
letes do not experience significant gains by taking only GH.
The  gains  are  more  impressive  when  the  drugs  are  com-
bined with anabolic steroids.

Psychological Effects of Steroids
You cannot be a great bodybuilder—or a great anything—if
you cannot control your mind. Recent studies suggest that
“roid rage” is a myth—in most people. It does affect eupho-
ria, energy, and sexual arousal, which could have powerful
effects on the desire to train hard. High blood testosterone
increases androgen receptors in the brain—just as it does in
muscle.  Steroids  increase  important  brain  chemicals,  such
as serotonin, GABA (gamma amino butyric acid), and ace-
tylcholine,  which  could  help  psych  you  up  and  encourage
you to train harder.

Health Risks of Anabolic Steroids
Side  effects  of  anabolic  steroids  include  liver  toxicity
and  tumors,  decreased  high  density  lipoproteins  (good
cholesterol),  cardiac  arrhythmia,  reduced  sperm  count,
lowered  testosterone  production,  high  blood  pressure,
increased risk of AIDS (due to shared needles), depressed
intolerance,  psychological
immune

function,  glucose

disturbances,  masculinization  in  women  and  children,
premature  closure  of  the  bone  growth  centers,  and  an
increased  cancer  risk.  Steroids  can  also  make  adolescent
acne  much  worse  in  young  men  and  women.  Severe  side
effects of anabolic steroid use have been reported in athletes,
including  myocardial  infarction  (heart  attack),  ventricular
tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), liver cancer, and severe
psychiatric disturbances. Athletes may be particularly prone
to side effects because they often take high dosages of the
drugs for prolonged times.

The message of this new research is clear: athletes must take
high doses of steroids if they want significant effects. There
is no purely anabolic steroid—androgen receptors exist in
most of the body’s tissues, including the heart and prostate
gland.  The  grave  risk  is  that  taking  extremely  high  doses
of steroids may be setting the stage for heart enlargement,
eventual  heart  failure,  and  prostate  enlargement  and  can-
cer.  In  addition,  high  doses  of  steroids  increase  IGF-1—a
potent growth stimulator of muscle and cancer cells. Steroid
users from the 1970s and 1980s have not been dying in large
numbers  from  cancer  and  heart  disease,  but  they  did  not
take  the  same  amount  of  steroids  as  modern  athletes.  Do
everything in your power to persuade young athletes not to
take steroids.

Growth Hormone
Growth hormone (GH) is popular with athletes who use it to increase muscle mass and
strength. Reports in the news media suggest that, like anabolic steroids, its use has fil-
tered down to non-athlete high school students. Recombinant human growth hormone
has made the hormone more widely available.

GH speeds the rate at which proteins enter muscle cells, which increases their growth
rate.  It  also  stimulates  another  growth  promoting  hormone  called  insulin-like  growth
factor. In addition, GH mobilizes fats from the fat cells, so the drug is used in hopes of
modifying body composition.

Human  growth  hormone  studies  have  shown  no  beneficial  effects  on  muscle  or  per-
formance. Animal studies found that growth hormone administration stimulates muscle
growth. Observations in athletes suggest that GH is highly anabolic in intensely training
elite bodybuilders. However, the side effects can be severe.

Prolonged growth hormone administration may result in low blood sugar, elevated in-
sulin levels, heart enlargement, and elevated blood fats. Long-term use could also lead

diomyopathy, peripheral nerve damage, weakening of the bones (osteoporosis),
arthritis, and heart disease.

Some  athletes  also  take  drugs  that  increase  natural  growth  hormone  secretion.  These
drugs include propranolol, vasopressin, clonidine, and levodopa. There is no evidence
that these practices enhance muscle hypertrophy.

Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1)
The use of recombinant  IgF-1, also called somotomedin C, has recently become a
popular drug among athletes. IGF-1 production is stimulated by growth hormone. It is
released mainly by the liver but also may be secreted by the testes, fat cells, bones, and
heart. IGF-1 is an extremely anabolic (muscle-building) hormone. The side effects are
thought to be similar to those of growth hormone. Long-term use may promote or ac-
cellerate cancer growth.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and
Androstenedione
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DhEA) and androstenedione are relatively weak andro-
gen hormones produced mainly in the adrenal glands. They are broken down to testo-
sterone, which explains their popularity with athletes. They are widely available in health
food stores and supermarkets. Athletes take this drug to stimulate muscle hypertrophy
and aid in weight control. DHEA or androstenedione administration in middle age and
older adults has been shown to result in improved “energy levels,” increased muscle mass,
better mental acuity, and enhanced immune function. However, the subjects had blood
levels of the hormone at least 20 percent below the average level of a 20-year old. The
substances’ value as ergogenic aids may lie in their ability to increase serum testoster-
one concentrations. The sale of androstenedione without a prescription was banned in
the United States in 2005.

High doses of DHEA (1600 mg/d) in young men have been shown to lead to a reduction
in  HDL  cholesterol  (good  cholesterol).  However,  in  elderly  subjects,  DHEA  has  been
shown to reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) but have no effect on HDL. Doses of 150 to 300
mg per day have a marked effect on testosterone concentration. This could lead to mas-
culinization in women and interfere with hormone controls in both sexes. Androsten-
edione administration could have similar side effects to those seen with DHEA. These
“pro-hormones” will likely have the same side effects in young people as testosterone—
stunted growth, skin problems, interference with normal sex hormones, and psychologi-
cal disorders. Girls should avoid them because they could interfere with the menstrual
cycle and potentially cause reproductive and bone problems.

Insulin
Some physically active people take insulin injections to promote muscle hypertrophy. In-
sulin, aside from its influence on glucose and fat metabolism, affects protein metabolism.
The effects include enhanced amino acid transport into cells, increased rate of incorpora-
tion of amino acids into protein, and suppression of protein breakdown. The effectiveness
of insulin supplementation or elevation in stimulating muscle hypertrophy is not known.
The  most  serious  side-effect  of  exogenous  insulin  administration  in  exercising  body-
builders is insulin shock, a condition where blood sugar reaches dangerously low levels.

Youth FitnessErgogenic Aids: Drugs and Supplements  |  271

Clenubuterol
Athletes take this drug (a ß2 adrenergic agonist) to prevent
muscle atrophy, increase lean body mass, and decrease body
fat. Beneficial effects have been shown in animals, but few
studies have been done in humans. Side effects include in-
somnia,  abnormal  heart  rhythm,  anxiety,  depressed  appe-
tite, and nausea. More serious side effects include enlarged
heart, heart failure, and heart attack. This drug is very easy
to get. Its side effects can be serious in young people, and the
personal trainer must strongly discourage its use.

Other Substances
Other substances sometimes used as ergogenic aids include
human  chorionic  gonadotropin  (HCG),  periactin,  conju-
gated linoleic acid (CLA), vanadyl sulfate, dibencozide, and
organ extracts. These agents are much less popular and their
effectiveness is questionable.

agenTS TaKen To

The  primary  purposes  of  taking  these  agents  is  to  replen-
ish  depleted  body  fuels  (with  creatine  phosphate:  creatine
supplementation;  with  muscle  and  liver  glycogen:  glucose
and lactate polymers) and serve as a source for post-exercise
protein synthesis (i.e., amino acids).

Creatine Supplementation
Creatine  (i.e.,  creatine  monohydrate)  is  among  the  most
popular and widely used supplements by athletes. Individu-
als use creatine supplements to build strength and muscle
mass, enhance recovery, and improve exercise capacity.

Creatine feeding increases the creatine phosphate content of
the  muscle  by  about  20  percent.  Creatine  phosphate  is  an
important  high-energy  chemical  to  maintain  ATP  levels.
Recall from our discussion of exercise physiology that ATP
supplies  the  energy  for  most  of  the  body’s  physiological
functions. The most effective dosage of creatine is 3 to 5 g per
day (1 teaspoon). Taking more than that causes no further
increase in total muscle creatine. Creatine supplementation
has been shown to improve performance in short-term, high
intensity, repetitive exercise, which might make it a valuable
supplement  for  physically  active  people.  It  may  improve
performance  by  augmenting  the  availability  of  creatine
phosphate and possibly regulating the rate of muscle sugar
breakdown.  It  may  also  increase  muscle-building  capacity
during resistive exercise by allowing more intense training.

Creatine  monohydrate  supplementation  has  been  associ-
ated  with  muscle  cramping  during  and  after  exercise.  The
long-term safety and effectiveness are currently unknown.
More  than  100  studies  on  this  supplement  have  failed
to  report  any  significant  side  effects.  However,  creatine
supplements should be used with caution in young people.
Personal  trainers  should  be  wary  of  recommending  them
to their clients because of possible liability issues. The long-
term  effects  and  safety  of  this  supplement  in  children  are
not known.

Amino Acid and Polypeptide
Supplements
Athletes  take  amino  acid  and  polypeptide  supplements  to
accelerate muscle development, decrease body fat, and stim-
ulate growth hormone release. There is little scientific proof
to support amino acid or polypeptide supplementation. The
protein  requirement  of  active  people  is  not  much  higher
than  for  sedentary  individuals,  so  the  rate  of  amino  acid
absorption from the gastrointestinal track is not important.
Also,  substituting  amino  acid  or  polypeptide  supplements
for protein-rich foods may cause deficiencies in important
nutrients such as iron and the B vitamins.

The  protein  requirement  for  active  athletes  is  not  much
greater  than  for  the  average  person—0.8  to  1.5  grams  of
protein  per  kilogram  of  body  weight  per  day.  However,
recent research shows that the timing of protein and amino
acid  feeding  is  very  important  for  stimulating  muscle
growth. Radioactive tracer studies, in which the metabolism
of  various  fuels  is  followed,  found  that  taking  a  protein
supplement  either  30  minutes  before  weight  training  or
immediately  afterwards  speeds  the  movement  of  amino
acids  into  muscle  and  stimulates  protein  synthesis  (i.e.,
makes new muscle tissue faster).

ectopic beats: Heart beat
originating somewhere other

paroxysmal atrial
tachycardia: Bouts of rapid,

Other Substances
Carbohydrate beverages consumed during and immediately following exercise enhance
recovery from intense training, speeding the replenishment of liver and muscle glycogen.
The use of other substances to speed recovery—such as vitamin C, N-acetyl-L-Cysteine
(NAC),  inosine,  and  beta-hydroxy  beta-methylbutyrate  (HMB)—is  not  currently  sup-
ported by positive research findings.

Serious exercisers often spend several hours a day training for their favorite activities.
Monotony and fatigue sometimes make significant improvement difficult. Many athletes
use stimulants to help them train harder and combat fatigue.

Amphetamines
Individuals take amphetamines to prevent fatigue and to increase confidence and train-
ing intensity. Examples of amphetamines include benzedrine, dexedrine, dexamyl and
methedrine. These drugs act by stimulating the nervous system. Effects include increased
blood pressure, heart rate, arousal, wakefulness, confidence, and the feeling of enhanced
capability to make decisions.

Studies show the drugs mask fatigue but may not increase endurance performance. Most
studies have shown increases in static strength but mixed results in muscle endurance.
These substances appear to aid power oriented movement skills in activities that employ
constant motor patterns—such as shot putting and hammer throwing—and theoretically
they could provide some benefit to bodybuilders and weightlifters by allowing them to
train harder.

Amphetamines can cause severe neural and psychological effects. These include aggres-
siveness,  paranoia,  hallucinations,  compulsive  behavior,  restlessness,  and  irritability.
They can cause arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), hypertension, and angina (heart
related chest pain). They are highly addictive and are particularly dangerous for young
people. Children must avoid them.

Caffeine
Caffeine—found in coffee, cola, tea, and chocolate—is
a favorite stimulant of active people. It stimulates the
central  nervous  system  to  release  adrenaline  (epine-
phrine). In athletics, caffeine acts as a stimulant and
fatty acid mobilizer. While there is some evidence
that caffeine may improve  endurance, the drug  does
not  appear  to  enhance  short-term  maximal  exercise
capacity.

The  diuretic  and  cardiac  stimulatory  properties  of
this  substance  can  combine  to  increase  the  risk  of
arrhythmias  such  as  ventricular  ectopic  beats  and
paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Caffeine produces
insomnia and is addicting.

Youth FitnessErgogenic Aids: Drugs and Supplements  |  273

Other Agents
Other agents used by physically active individuals to enhance training intensity include
cocaine, ephedrine, and ginseng. Cocaine use is not thought to be widespread in athletes,
but some reportedly use it to increase training intensity. Ephedrine, a weak stimulant, is
widely used by athletes during workouts. Studies have shown that despite a slight stimu-
lating effect on blood pressure and on exercise and recovery heart rates, ephedrine had
no effect on physical work capacity. Ginseng is also popular with athletes, but little evi-
dence exists to support its use as an ergogenic aid.

Drugs used in weight control include those that suppress appetite, thermogenic drugs,
drugs  affecting  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  diuretics  to  control  weight  and  increase
muscle  definition.  Gymnasts,  dancers,  figure  skaters,  and  weight-class  athletes  use  a
variety of techniques to decrease body fat. They may do this immediately before a contest
or chronically because of the requirements of the sport.

Appetite  suppressing  drugs  work  by  acting  on  catecholamine  neurotransmitters
or  serotonin  neurotransmitters  or  by  blocking  opioid  receptors.  Thermogenic
drugs affect metabolic rate. Gastrointestinal drugs attempt to affect nutrient absorption.
Other agents with questionable effectiveness and desirability include human chorionic
gonadotropin, growth hormone, glucagon, progesterone, and biguanides.

Appetite  suppressants  include  amphetamine,  ephedrine,  sibutramine,  diethylpropion,
fenfluramine, and phenylpropanolamine. While these drugs depress appetite and usually
trigger  weight  loss,  some  produce  serious  side  effects.  Amphetamine,  for  example,  is
highly addictive and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and impair temperature regulation.

Thermogenic drugs include thyroid hormone, ephedrine, and dinitrophenol. Thyroid
hormones were in common use in the 1970s. They reduced lean body mass and increased
the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. Ephedrine and ß-agonists have been suggested as
useful  agents,  but more research  must establish their effectiveness. Uncoupling  agents
such as dinitrophenol are toxic at effective dosages and are associated with neuropathy
and cataracts.

Drugs  affecting  the  gastrointestinal  tract  include  orlistat,  dietary  fiber,  and  sucrose
polyester. Orlistat—one of two weight loss prescription drugs approved in the United
States—partially blocks fat absorption. While effective, it has side effects such as abdomi-
nal  cramping  and  oily  stools,  and  the  possibility  of  severe  liver  injury—clearly  unac-
ceptable to most people. Dietary fiber causes gastrointestinal distention and may restrict
energy intake. Limited clinical trials suggest that including fiber supplements may aid
weight loss. Sucrose polyester (Olestra) is a new diet ingredient of some promise. This
substance cannot be digested and can be substituted for fats in the diet. The few studies
on Olestra have shown conflicting results.

The combination of ephedrine and caffeine is an effective weight loss agent comparable
to either orlistat or sibutramine. However, the use of these supplements remains contro-
versial. The personal trainer should not recommend this supplement weight loss stack
to young people without parental permission and the input of a health care professional.
While the supplements may be effective, you should not recommend them to young cli-
ents at this time due to the extensive controversy surrounding their use.

International Sports Sciences Association274  |  unit 19

diuretics: Drugs or substances
that promote urine excretion.

Diuretics
Before  a  contest,  bodybuilders  attempt  to  accentuate  their  muscle  definition  by  using
diuretics, potassium supplements, and low calorie diets. Some bodybuilders also take
potassium supplements to promote fluid retention in muscle cells, thus hoping to increase
muscle size. Athletes combine these practices with very low calorie diets and dehydration
in the quest for leanness.

Efficacy and Side Effects
There  is  no  evidence  that  these  unhealthy  practices  improve  performance  in
bodybuilding.  Serious  medical  and  health  complications  have  developed,  including
rhabdomyolysis (suggested by elevated serum creatine kinase and phosphorous), hypo-
tension, marked hemoconcentration, hyperkalemia (due to the use of potassium-sparing
diuretics and potassium supplements), cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.

SuMMARY

Active young people—even pre-teens—consume a wide variety of drugs and
nutritional supplements in the quest to improve performance and create the
“perfect body.” They take these substances to: (1) enhance muscle mass, (2) speed
recovery and prevent the effects of over training, (3) increase training intensity and
aggressiveness, and (4) control fat, body water, and appetite. The personal trainer
must remain vigilant about not recommending any supplement or drug to a young
athlete unless it is done with the advice and consent of the parent and a health
professional. While most supplements are safe in adults, scientists do not know
about long-term health risks in children. Personal trainers should be conservative
when dealing with young athletes, drugs, and supplements.

It  was  first  down  and  ten  yards  to  go  on  the  Oakdale  Vikings’  own  30-yard  line.  Jim
Haynes was the quarterback, and he was having a great year. Only two more games and
the  season  would  be  over—Jim  was  sure  to  get  many  scholarship  offers  from  the  big
schools. He took the snap, dropped back into a pocket of blockers, and looked for an
open receiver. But things started to go wrong—Jim’s pass protection deteriorated, and he
was forced into the open with several defensive players breathing down his neck. All of a
sudden, a blitzing linebacker came at him like the night train. Jim went down hard as the
linebacker hit him with a crunch on the side of his knee. The knee seemed to snap like a
rubber band. Jim’s season—and possibly his career—were over.

Scenes like this are repeated time and again on playing fields across the country. There are
risks involved in athletics, but most of us feel the risks are worth it because of the many
benefits sports has to offer. Coaches, athletes, personal trainers, and parents should take
steps  to  minimize  athletic  injuries  and  to  make  sure  they  are  adequately  rehabilitated
when they do occur. Athletics can be one of the profound influences in a child’s life. But
if an athletic program presents undue risk of serious injury, it may produce an adult with
chronically sore joints and lack of function. A safe athletic program requires physicians,
coaches, athletes, trainers, and parents to work together to insure that sports participation
remains a positive experience, and not one that produces athletic casualties. This section
presents the principles of prevention and treatment of athletic injuries for children.

Youth FitnessPreventing Injuries  |  279

PREvENTINg INJuRIES
There  are  certain  things  a  parent  can  do  at  home  to  help
a  child become  physically fit. But beyond that,  preventing
injuries  in  children’s  sports  often  requires  pressuring  the
athletic  establishment  to  maintain  minimal  standards.
Athletic  teams—whether  they  are  junior  club  soccer,
peewee  football,  or  high  school  softball—should  provide
proper  coaching,  good  equipment,  and  adequate  medical
supervision for its players.

ProPer coachIng
Coaches  are  in  a  unique  position—they  can  shape  the
physical  and,  to  an  extent,  the  emotional  condition  of  the
team. The coach sets the tone of the practices and the games.
He or she decides whether players will be vicious or obey
the rules, sloppy or play with skill and finesse. The personal
trainer  is  in  a  similar  position.  Your  professionalism  and
programming  skill  can  make  the  difference  between  a
successful experience and one that ends in injury.

Most coaches are knowledgeable and extremely dedicated.
They teach techniques that prevent injuries and encourage
physical  fitness.  Many  of  them  also  keep  up-to-date  with
current knowledge of training and exercise physiology.

methods.  Good  sports  fundamentals  make  movements
more  efficient  and  predictable—it’s  the  unexpected  that
often produces an injury.

Most  children  will  participate  in  “sandlot”  sports  if  they
cannot  participate  in  organized  athletics.  Sandlot  games
are notorious sites for serious injuries. I remember several
instances from my own childhood—one boy was in a body
cast for six months after a playground tackle football game,
and  another  broke  his  neck  and  became  a  quadriplegic
from an impromptu game of rugby. You can minimize the
incidence of tragic injuries by teaching proper fundamentals
and practicing according to established rules.

The  coach’s  attitude  is  important  in  preventing  injuries.
Coaches work with impressionable boys and girls. Coaches
who  tell  their  young  players  to  “kill”  the  opponent  or
use  unsportsmanlike  behavior  can  expect  athletes  to  use
techniques that end in injury.

A  coach  has  an  opportunity  to  take  a  stand  against  what
seems to be an insatiable appetite for violence in America.
People  love  to  watch  a  professional  wrestler  who  knocks
an  opponent  out  of  the  ring.  The  crowd  cheers  when  a
hockey player gets hit in the jaw with a stick. The coach can
encourage  young  athletes  to  embrace  the  finer  aspects  of
sports, not the cheap thrills of violence.

A good coach or personal trainer can minimize even minor
injuries  by  teaching  proper  sports  fundamentals.  The
incidence of sore shoulders, elbows, and wrists will be fewer
when you teach proper throwing techniques. Back injuries
can  be  greatly  reduced  when  you  teach  correct  lifting

Coaches  and  personal  trainers  who  get  hung  up  on  the
fantasy of professional sports and try to apply it to school
or  club-level  teams  are  behaving  unprofessionally.  For
example,  one  of  the  most  dangerous  sports  techniques
taught by some football coaches is spearing, a blocking and

International Sports Sciences Association280  |  unit 20

tackling  technique  that  requires  initial  contact  with  the
head. Because of hard plastic football helmets, the head can
be used as a weapon to punish opponents, but spearing has
resulted  in  an  increase  in  serious  neck  injuries  that  often
have  tragic  consequences.  Although  the  governing  bodies
of football at all levels of play prohibit this technique, many
coaches still teach spearing. Coaches, personal trainers, and
parents should support teaching basic sports fundamentals
that promote sports safety rather than dangerous techniques
designed to hurt an opponent.

The  positive  aspects  of  sports  should  always  outweigh  the
negative ones. A lifetime with a bad knee is a big price to
pay  for  poor  judgment  by  an  overambitious  coach.
Fortunately,  serious  injuries  rarely  occur  in  children’s
sports  because  the  vast  majority  of  coaches  are  extremely
competent  and  take  every  precaution  to  insure  the  safety
of  young  athletes,  and  they  understand  that  children  are
smaller,  weaker,  and  slower  than  adult  athletes.  Coaches
sometimes  adopt  training  methods  and  attitudes  that
conflict  with  current  medical  knowledge  and  acceptable
coaching practices, however.

Every  fall  there  are  several  deaths  in  football  caused  by
heat stroke, a condition in which the body loses the ability
to  regulate  temperature.  These  deaths  are  tragic  and
unnecessary. Athletes should be encouraged (or even forced)
to drink plenty of water when they engage in heavy exercise,
particularly in hot and humid weather. It’s surprising how
many coaches are ignorant about the importance of fluids
during  exercise.  Some  coaches  even  withhold  water  from
players in the hope of “making them tough.”

Hundreds  of  studies  show  that  adequate  fluid  intake  is
essential for controlling body temperature during exercise.
The natural thirst of the athlete is not enough to accomplish
this,  since  dehydration  and  rising  body  temperature  will
impact  the  thirst  for  water.  It  is  therefore  important  for
athletes  to  drink  water  or  athletic  beverages  anytime  they
feel thirsty.

Obesity  has  contributed  to  many  of  the  heat  injuries  seen
in  recent  years.  In  college  and  high  school  football,  for
example,  many  athletes  weight  more  than  300  pounds.
Large, fast athletes can inflict considerable damage on the
football field. However, they should also strive for leanness.

The role oF ParenTS
and The PerSonal TraIner

Physical Conditioning
Physical conditioning is one of the most important factors
in the prevention of athletic injuries. Parents and personal
trainers  can  encourage  their  children  to  remain  fit  during
the entire year—not just when the sport is in season. Frantic
fitness programs begun two weeks before the season begins
make  the  athlete  a  candidate  for  injury.  At  the  very  least,
this  last-minute  fitness  developmental  strategy  results  in
poor performance. Many schools have rules against sports
practices during the off-season. Although these rules were
instituted  to  prevent  overemphasis  of  sports,  they  often
result in unfit athletes. It is up to parents—working with the
personal  trainer—to  assume  part  of  the  responsibility  for
encouraging fitness in their children.

Consistency
Continue the physical conditioning program throughout the
year. Immediately after the season, emphasize well-rounded
general conditioning. Encourage the child to systematically
develop endurance, strength, power, flexibility, agility, and
speed.  Consistency  remains  the  key.  The  intensity  does
not have to be as severe as during the actual season. Young
athletes should begin early to plan their training program
and keep a written record of it. Help children set attainable,
short-term goals. For example, a young runner might move

up to running 6 to 10 miles a day within a year; a football
player  might  have  a  goal  of  lifting  a  particular  weight  or
performing  a  certain  number  of  chin-ups.  People  always
work  harder  when  they  have  realistic  goals  and  can  see
improvement.  Parents  and  trainers  can  help  children  set
goals and provide encouragement to attain them.

Good Posture
Help  children  develop  good  posture.  Poor  posture  is  a
cause of many injuries, particularly to the back. With good
posture,  the  child  should  be  able  to  remain  standing  or
seated  for  a  reasonably  long  period  of  time  with  minimal
effort.  Properly  aligned  bones  and  their  ligamentous
attachments  require  little  muscular  exertion  to  maintain
efficient body positions. However, when the child assumes
an  inefficient  body  posture,  the  muscles  must  assist  the
skeleton  to  maintain  unnatural  positions.  These  muscles
fatigue easily and stress spinal joints and ligaments critical
for  maintaining  painless  postures.  Although  some  bad
posture  characteristics  come  from  structural  and  genetic
abnormalities, most posture problems stem from bad habits
developed during childhood.

Adolescents, in particular, often assume postures that reflect
the  way  they  feel  about  themselves  psychologically.  The
athlete,  after  losing  a  game  or  making  a  mistake,  is  often
slumped  and  dejected.  His  head  is  bowed  and  he  walks
with  a  slow  shuffle.  This  is  the  classic  “agony  of  defeat”
posture. Children with negative attitudes about themselves
may develop this type of drooped stance as a chronic habit.
Slouching postures produce fatigue and stress the supportive

structures  of  the  back  and  neck. This  serves  as  another  example  of  the  importance  of
developing  positive  attitudes  in  children.  Good  self-image  supports  emotional  and
physical well–being.

Coaches, personal trainers, and parents should encourage prudent living habits. Growing
children need adequate rest and a well-balanced diet. Unfortunately, our fast-food society
makes empty-calorie snacks look desirable. Children should be educated about the need
for proper nutrition and the hazards of drugs, smoking, and alcohol. They should get this
message from an early age—at home and at school. This will help them to confront the
social pressures to assume an unhealthy lifestyle.

good equIPmenT
Modern  synthetics  have  revolutionized  athletic  equipment,  from  tennis  racquets  and
skis to running surfaces and playing fields. Unfortunately, children often receive inferior
equipment  presented  under  the  guise  of  “junior  models.”  Inadequate  equipment  can
diminish performance or even cause injury. A loose-fitting football helmet may cause
a  head  or  neck  injury.  Ski  bindings  that  do  not  release  can  result  in  a  broken  leg.  A
tennis racquet too large for a child may cause elbow or shoulder pain. Children must
have good-quality equipment that fits properly.

Safety  equipment  should  be  mandatory.  Children  should  wear  helmets  and  pads  in
skateboarding  and  a  life  jacket  when  sailing,  waterskiing,  or  river  rafting.  Kids  often
tempt fate by performing foolhardy feats. Although this seems to be part of growing up,
children should be required to use safety equipment for their own good.

medIcal SuPervISIon
Proper medical supervision of the young athlete falls to the physician who assesses the
child’s suitability for sports and directly assumes responsibility for treatment of injuries,
the physical therapist or athletic trainer who supervises rehabilitation of injuries, and
the coach or personal trainer who directly supervises the health care of the child athlete
on the field and at the health and fitness club. Each has definite responsibilities. In cases
where  money  is  a  problem,  parents  will  have  to  assume  the  first-aid  responsibilities
that  should  ideally  be  the  doctor’s.  Child  athletes  should  be  regularly  examined  by  a
licensed physician.

Youth FitnessPreventing Injuries  |  283

Ideally,  the  physician  should  have  a  good  knowledge  of  growth  and  development  and
a  familiarity  with  sports  medicine.  An  orthopedic  specialist  should  evaluate  injuries
involving bones and joints—particularly in bone growth centers. Team doctors are usually
best  for  treating  athletic  injuries  because  most  of  them  have  had  a  lot  of  experience.
They  often  have  the  best  judgment  about  when  the  athlete  should  play  or  rest.  Most
club sports—youth soccer, softball, or football—do not have team physicians. So parents,
sometimes with the advice of the personal trainer, should choose a family physician who
understands athletics and exercise.

Duties of the athlete’s sports physician
The athlete’s physician should:

•  Determine if the child has the physical maturity to safely participate in a sport.

•  Restrict a child from a sport if he or she has medical problems.

•  Recommend to children with medical problems alternative sports and physical

activities appropriate for their condition.

•  Obtain prompt treatment for conditions encountered during the health

examination.

A physician should be present during any athletic contest that involves potential risk of
serious injury. Sports that particularly need direct medical supervision include football,
wrestling,  basketball,  gymnastics,  soccer,  water  polo,  and  ice  hockey.  If  possible,  a
physician  should  be  on  call  for  football  practices  because  most  injuries  occur  during
training and practice sessions.

Ideally, one physician should be involved in an organization’s entire athletic program to
provide consistency of health care and better readiness for emergencies. The physician
should always have emergency equipment available.

A surprising number of athletic teams, particularly at the elementary school and junior
high levels, have no medical supervision at all. The community should strive to improve
the health care in sports at all levels. At the very least, qualified athletic trainers should
be available to help fill the void. If no trainer is available, then coaches must have good
knowledge of first aid and emergency procedures.

when To call The docTor
During the course of organized athletics and impromptu games, children get all kinds of
bumps and bruises. If they ran to the doctor every time this happened, this would quickly
drain the time and resources of both the physician and the family.

Most minor injuries to muscles and joints do not require medical examination. People
should “wait and see” before consulting a physician for most muscle and joint injuries. It
is difficult to list hard and fast rules for separating serious from relatively benign athletic
injuries, but here are some general guidelines:

•  The proper way to treat tennis elbow, sore muscles, Achilles tendon pains, and
other overuse injuries is to gradually progress from initial rest to stretching and
then to systematic strengthening. The child should see a physician if the pain
from an overuse injury does not disappear after several weeks.

•

Injuries that require immediate medical attention are those to the head and
eye; “traumatic” injuries, caused by sudden blows or an overwhelming force,
that will usually result in swelling—particularly to the ankle and knee; inju-
ries involving damage to the ligaments; injuries involving broken bones; and
internally-related disorders such as chest pains, fainting, and intolerance to

or injury.

heat. Unless the injury is obviously minor, get the child to a doctor as quickly
as possible. Be careful not to underestimate the seriousness of an injury.

•  The personal trainer should have an emergency medical plan worked out in

advance with the parents and the health and fitness club.

•  Teach children to “listen” to their bodies. If the pain from an injury is beyond
tolerance, seek medical attention quickly. However, if the pain is only a spasm
or cramp from overexertion, there is very little a doctor can do. Think of how
the injury happened: a back injury sustained when five defensive players
stomped on the child’s spine may call for an x-ray; a backache caused by
hitting too many balls at the driving range may not.

SuMMARY

Parents, coaches, and personal trainers should help the child keep athletics and ath-
letic injuries in perspective. Injured young athletes who play with injuries or fail to
fully rehabilitate them may be risking a lifetime of discomfort and lack of function.

Prevent injuries with proper coaching, good equipment, proper medical supervision,
and physical conditioning. The immediate care of muscle and joint injuries includes
rest, immobilization, elevation, ice, and compression. Rehabilitation of these injuries
should include restoration of range of motion, strength, and endurance.

Specific treatment of athletic injuries in children’s athletics is beyond the scope of this course. However, it is important
that personal trainers know the general principles involved in sports injuries and disabilities commonly experienced
by children. (See Table 21.1 on page 293.)

INJuRIES TO JOINTS AND MuSCLES
Joint and muscle injuries are common in children’s sports but are usually relatively be-
nign if cared for properly. In general, the immediate care of these injuries involves rest,
immobilization, ice, elevation, and compression.

Very often after a child sustains an injury  such as  a pulled  muscle, sprained  ankle, or
twisted knee, function appears to be almost normal. The tendency is often to “run it off.”
Because the muscle is warm and initial swelling is minimal, a child can easily underesti-
mate an injury. Continued playing with an injury is only going to make things worse and
delay recovery. It is important that the injured area be immobilized and weight bearing
minimized or eliminated. Although the athlete may want to maintain motion in the joint,
he or she should try to do so without putting too much weight on it.

ImmedIaTe TreaTmenT
One of the best strategies an athlete can employ to speed recovery from an injury is to
ice the area. Ice numbs the injured area and blocks much of the pain by slowing down
the activity of the nerves that transmit pain sensations. A good ice treatment relaxes the
injured area and reduces muscle spasms that may occur, and simultaneously increases
blood flow deep in tissues without causing swelling.

Cryokinetics, which entails moving an injured area after an initial cooling with ice, has
brought  important  breakthroughs  in  athletic  injury  treatment.  Until  recently,  the  im-
mediate treatment of an injury was limited to immobilization followed by heat treatment
and massage. Cryokinetics requires the athlete to take the weight off the injured area to a
certain extent, but also involves an attempt to regain and maintain the area’s full range of
motion. Treat a sprained ankle, for example, by applying an ice pack, wrapping the ankle
in an elastic bandage, and elevating the foot. The injured athlete would then try to move
his or her foot forward and backward, and downward and upward. Immobilization of the
ankle is followed by an attempt to regain the full range of foot motion.

cryokinetics: Rehabilitation
technique that uses exercise and
ice.

Youth FitnessCommon Injuries in Children’s Sports  |  287

deconditioning: Loss of fitness
through rest or injury.

ice massage: Massaging a
body part with a small block of
ice.

An injured child can quickly recover full range of motion in the injured area and normal
use of his body through continued ice therapy. In addition, continued ice treatment pre-
vents much of the deconditioning from an injury because the therapy reduces pain and
muscle spasms. Ice treatment, because it does not eliminate all pain sensations, keeps the
child from overdoing it and possibly making the injury worse.

The most common types of ice treatment are ice massage, ice bath, and ice pack. The
ice massage is effective for cooling a particular region. Fill a paper cup with water and
freeze it. When the ice is formed, peel away the upper half of the cup and hold the ice
by the lower half of the cup. Using a circular motion, massage the injured area for 7 to
10 minutes, or until numbness sets in. You can avoid numbing your fingers by placing a
tongue depressor in the cup of water before making the ice. This will create a large frozen
lollipop with a convenient handle. A word of caution: never use dry ice.

An  ice  pack  is  valuable  for  immediate  treatment  of  muscle  and  joint  injuries.  Take  a
wet towel and place a layer of crushed ice on it, then wrap or place the towel directly
on the injury. Another method of ice packing involves placing a plastic bag filled with
ice  directly  on  the  injury.  However,  this  kind  of  ice  pack  is  less  effective  because  the
ice  is  often  unevenly  distributed.  Commercially  available  ice  packs  can  be  carried  in
your athletic bag until needed. Breaking a container inside the pack activates a chemical
reaction that creates a cold ice pack which lasts for 20 to 30 minutes.

Immersion in ice water can be effective for injuries to the ankles, hands, feet, elbows, and
sometimes knees. The ice bath can also be used during the later stages of injury rehabili-
tation when it is no longer necessary to elevate the injured part. Add about two-dozen ice
cubes to a sink or basin filled with cold water. Immerse the injured area in the ice water
and leave it there. If you are only able to tolerate a few minutes, take the injured part out
of the water for about a minute, and then reimmerse it for seven to eight minutes. Keep-
ing an injured area in the ice water for more than ten minutes will do little good. In fact,
you risk developing frostbite by immersing an injury for too long.

International Sports Sciences Association288  |  unit 21

hydrocollator packs: Canvas
bags filled with silicon that are
heated in water and used for
heat therapy.

After the swelling of an injured area has subsided,
use  heat  to  increase  circulation  and  relax  the
muscles.  Because  effective  healing  cannot
progress  until  swelling  decreases,  do  not  use
heat sooner than 48 to 72 hours after a muscle or
joint injury. Premature heat therapy may actually
increase swelling and retard the healing process.
This  is  particularly  true  for  muscle  pulls  and
joint damage, which are usually accompanied by
damage to the blood vessels.

Heat  can  be  administered  in  several  different
ways. The hot bath or whirlpool is probably easi-
est.  Water  temperature  should  be  kept  between
90°  and  105°  Fahrenheit,  with  104°  being  com-
fortable for most people. Never allow your child to use a hot whirlpool bath if he or she
has  lost  the  tactile  sense;  in  this  kind  of  injury,  the  body  may  be  more  susceptible  to
burns. Other kinds of heat treatment include hot water bottles, heating pads, hydrocol-
lator packs (silicone-filled canvas bags heated in water), and heat lamps.

rehabIlITaTIon
Rehabilitation of muscle and joint injuries is critical. After an injury, the body attempts
to protect itself by producing muscle spasms and adhesions in joints that restrict motion.
Psychologically, the natural tendency is to baby the injury to keep it from getting worse.
Many athletes fail to restore normal function after an injury and never seem to get any
better. The athlete must work hard to restore as much strength, flexibility, and endurance
as possible. Start gradually, and systematically increase the intensity of rehabilitation ex-
ercises until normal function is restored.

An injured child should try to rehabilitate the injury as much as possible before returning
to full sports participation. For a serious injury, the decision to return should be made by
a physician. Optimal healing often requires rest from sports; an injured part of the body
that’s not completely healed is extremely vulnerable to re-injury. Here are some general
principles you can follow to help the child decide when to return to sports:

•  The child should not return to sports until the injured area is completely

restored to its full range of motion both actively and passively. Simply recover-
ing the ability to move the knee, shoulder, or elbow in a non-active situation
is not enough rehabilitation. The body must be able to withstand the rigors of
sports, as well as before the injury.

•  All compensating motions such as limping and favoring an injured area should
be eliminated. After a lower body injury, for instance, rehabilitation remains
incomplete unless the athlete can run forward, backward, and laterally, pain
free. They must also recover the ability to start and stop quickly.

•  The child should regain full strength and power before returning to active
sports. Compare the injured side with the uninjured side to see if size and
strength are equal. If not, more rehabilitation is required before resuming play.

•  The injured athlete should be relatively free of pain. Some pain is a natural

part of sports; the old football maxim, “You’ve got to play with small hurts,”
is true. However, if the pain in an injured area is significant, the injury is
not rehabilitated.

overuse injuries: Injuries
developed through excessive
exercise or overtraining.

OvERuSE INJuRIES
Many young athletes can become over motivated, and they look as if they are trying to
make the Olympic team in a month. A variety of overuse injuries can occur when the
athlete trains beyond the body’s tolerance. Examples include shin splints, sore Achilles
tendons, and tennis elbow. These injuries occur from overworking a relatively weak area
and from improper sports techniques.

Modern training methods have produced an increase in overuse injuries. It is common
for young swimmers to put in as much as 15,000 meters per day or for young distance
runners to cover 100 miles a week. These brutal training programs do produce results.
Competitive records by young athletes continue to improve. However, the young athlete
is often pushed too far, too fast. Often, there is inadequate preparation or buildup for
these difficult exercise programs. Overuse injuries can be tricky to deal with, particularly
because the ultimate responsibility for rehabilitation lies with the individual athlete, the
family,  their  coaches,  and  personal  trainer.  Sometimes  athletes  must  rest  to  heal  and
improve performance.

The overuse injury is related to the overtraining syndrome. This condition is particularly
prevalent in highly motivated athletes. The overtrained athlete feels sluggish, tired, sore,
and  may  lack  enthusiasm.  Often  he  or  she  performs  well  during  practice  but  blows  it
during  competition.  Many  coaches  would  call  this  the  “choke”  syndrome.  However,
sports  scientists  have  recently  shown  that  overtraining  is  at  least  partially  due  to  lack
of  glycogen,  an  important  muscle  fuel.  Overtraining  depletes  glycogen,  the  complex
carbohydrate so important for muscular exercise. When muscles run low on this fuel, they
ache and do not perform as well. Other chemicals and fuel such as creatine phosphate,
testosterone, and cortisol are also linked to overtraining. Overtraining increases the risk
of overuse injuries when an athlete is fatigued and run down. In such cases, injury is just
around the corner.

Rest is very important for the overtrained athlete. Rest is the only thing that can break
the vicious cycle—the hard training athlete does poorly in competition, so he trains even
harder. The harder he exercises, the more he gets overtrained. Competitive performances
get worse. The best thing for the overtrained athlete is to take a few days off and to check
the carbohydrate content of the diet. Any athlete involved in vigorous training should
consume large amounts of carbohydrates to maximize muscle fuel stores.

imbalance injuries: Injuries

oSgood-SchlaTTer’S dISeaSe
Osgood-Schlatter’s  disease is an overuse injury, not an actual disease. Adolescents
often experience pain, swelling, and tenderness just below the kneecap where the patella
ligament connects to the bony growth on the center of the upper part of the tibia (the
large bone of the lower leg). This condition, commonly known as Osgood-Schlatter’s dis-
ease, is caused by repeated small tears at the point where the patellar ligament connects
to the tibia.

Osgood-Schlatter’s  usually  afflicts  girls  between  eight  and  thirteen  years  and  boys  be-
tween ten and fifteen years. Boys are about three times more susceptible than girls. The
condition causes pain during kneeling, direct contact with objects, running, and climb-
ing. Pain relief comes from rest and restriction from physical activities. It usually does
not  disappear  completely  until  after  the  child  enters  adulthood  (about  age  21  to  23).
Advise parents to consult a physician if you suspect your client has this condition. Mild
hamstring and quad stretching, and cutting back on the volume and intensity of work-
outs usually brings relief.

IMbALANCE INJuRIES
Imbalance  injuries can be caused by poor posture, training that overdevelops some
muscle groups at the expense of others, and anatomical weaknesses. Normal movements
usually  do  not  involve  undue  risk  of  injury.  But  sports,  by  their  very  nature,  require
stretching a little further or trying a little harder. Add fatigue, anxiety, anger, poor body
mechanics, and bad luck, and any weak links in the body’s structure can be overwhelmed.
Injuries may be inevitable.

Muscle imbalance often causes injuries. Some people develop the muscles on the front
of the thigh (quadriceps), for example, without also developing the muscles to the same

Youth FitnessCommon Injuries in Children’s Sports  |  291

extent on the back of the thigh (hamstrings). This produces an imbalance that may pre-
cipitate hamstring pulls.

Back pain is also caused by muscle imbalances and lack of muscle endurance in the spine,
abdomen, hips, and thighs. Current treatment for the prevention and rehabilitation of
many kinds of back pain involves spinal stabilization, with exercises that increase muscle
endurance in the abdominal muscles (crunches), spinal muscles (birddog exercise), and
lateral trunk muscles (side bridges to increase the endurance of the obliques and quad-
ratus lumborum muscle).

Our upright posture causes many aches and pains that four-legged animals do not have.
Many children have minor anatomical imbalances that throw their bodies out of balance
and increase the risk of injury. For instance, if one leg is longer than the other, problems
may develop in the back, knees, or hips. A podiatrist (foot doctor) may be able to de-
sign orthotics to restore anatomical balance. Orthotics are inserts that fit into shoes and
place the feet and thus the legs in better anatomical alignment. They have proven valu-
able for many imbalance injuries. Orthotics can be expensive (about $300 to $500), but
often they improve sore knees and hips within a few days.

gROWTh PLATE INJuRIES
As you may recall from earlier in this text (Unit One), the growth plate, or epiphyseal
plate,  is  the  portion  of  the  bone  where  growth  occurs.  When  growth  is  complete,  the
epiphyses  fuse,  and  the  growth  plates  disappear.  Bone  growth  at  the  epiphyseal  plate
depends upon blood supply; growth may be compromised if this area is injured and the
blood is supply interrupted.

Sports and exercise can affect bone growth in different ways. The mild stress of active play
and sports makes bones stronger and more resilient, because bones adapt to stresses and
strains. Bones of active athletes have a larger diameter and marrow cavity (the portion of
bones where red blood cells are produced). Severe stress can cause bone inflammation
and interrupt normal bone growth.

The most common growth plate injuries in children’s  sports include  separation of the
growth plate (a bone break or fracture that goes through the growth plate) and crush
injuries to the growth plate. These injuries can occur by sudden contact, as when a child
tries  to  break  a  fall  with  outstretched  arms,  or  from  violent  twisting  motions  such  as
those that occur during skiing. Growth plate injuries can also occur more subtly from re-
peated throwing or running movements. These are classified as overuse injuries and can
be difficult to diagnose. So-called sprains around joints in the fingers, ankles, elbows,
knees, or shoulders may really be growth plate in-
juries.  Proper  diagnosis  often  requires  the  advice
of  an  orthopedic  specialist.  Chronic  pain  may  be
a sign of growth plate injury and should be investi-
gated by a qualified medical professional.

Growth  plate  injuries  are  fairly  uncommon  and
account for only six percent of all injuries in chil-
dren’s athletics. Children have relatively weak mus-
cles  and  low  body  weights  so  they  do  not  often
develop  the  high  forces  that  cause  these  injuries.
Certain  children,  however,  are  at  increased  risk
for  injury.  Overweight  children  can  create  forces
strong enough to cause growth plate injury. Muscle
development  can  lag  in  rapidly  growing  children

obliques: Important muscles
on the sides of the abdomen
that help to rotate and bend the

muscles.

of the ligaments of a joint.

and leave bones, joints, and growth plates more vulnerable to injury. After an illness or
injury, muscles become deconditioned to such an extent that growth plates are more sus-
ceptible to harm. Children should rebuild fitness after a period of deconditioning before
resuming active training and competition.

Throwing  sports  that  involve  pitching  or  javelin  throwing  place  an  unusual  strain  on
bone growth centers. The resulting injuries, called little league shoulder, javelin elbow, or
little league elbow, can be caused by too much throwing and poor technique. The high
incidence  of  shoulder  and  arm  injuries  has  created  a  bad  reputation  for  Little  League
baseball among some pediatricians.

Little League baseball limits the number of innings pitched. Total pitches in a game are
well within the bounds of safety. Unfortunately, most children pitch at home in addition
to official practice. The extra strain of the outside practice probably causes most injuries.

The method of delivery is an important factor in throwing injuries. There are many more
injuries reported when pitchers used a sidearm delivery than a throw that comes right
over  the  top.  Limit  or  stop  pitching  if  the  child  has  arm  or  shoulder  pain.  Continued
pitching with an arm injury could lead to problems later in life and compromise further
athletic development.

Javelin  throwing  can  easily  result  in  growth  plate  injuries  in  children.  Because  of  the
weight of the implement, errors in throwing technique can severely affect bone growth
centers. Many experts believe that children should not throw the javelin until they ap-
proach  skeletal  maturity—usually  at  age  16  to  18.  The  natural  tendency  of  beginning
throwers is to use a sidearm motion that disposes them to injury. Proper javelin tech-
nique requires expert coaching, which is rarely available to young adolescents.

OThER CONDITIONS

mononucleoSIS
Symptoms of infectious  mononucleosis include flu-like symptoms of sore throat, fe-
ver,  enlarged  lymph  nodes  in  the  neck,  and  fatigue. The  Epstein-Barr  virus  carried  in
the throat and bloodstream causes “mono.” Many people are immune to mononucleosis
because their bodies produce an antibody to the disease. Those who do not produce the
antibody remain susceptible to the illness.

The symptoms usually last 14 to 21 days. The disease may produce an enlarged spleen,
which may delay an athlete’s return to practice. The spleen is a reservoir and cleanser of
blood;  if  enlarged,  it  can  easily  rupture  during  contact  sports.  An  athlete  with  mono-
nucleosis and an enlarged spleen should be examined and cleared by a physician. Most
physicians recommend a delay of three to four weeks after the disappearance of symp-
toms before returning to contact sports. Any vigorous exercise with an enlarged spleen
places the athlete at increased risk. A ruptured spleen is a major medical emergency.

Preventing mononucleosis is difficult. Transmission occurs by kissing or drinking from
a  contaminated  cup  or  pop  bottle.  Avoid  drinking  from  communal  glasses  or  cups  at
practice and tell athletes to wash their hands regularly, especially before meals and after
going to the bathroom.

mononucleosis: Caused by
infection with the Epstein Barr
virus. Characterized by extreme
fatigue, enlarged spleen, and
decreased exercise capacity.

spleen: Organ located on the
left side of the abdomen near
the stomach that produces
lymphocytes, filters the blood,
stores blood cells and destroys
those that are aging.

Youth FitnessCommon Injuries in Children’s Sports  |  293

asthma: Lung disease
characterized by narrowing of
the lung passageways, making
breathing difficult.

aSThma
Asthma is a breathing disorder characterized by choking, shortness of breath, tightness in
the chest, increased mucus production, and fatigue. There are over 1.5 million asthmatic
children in the United States, most of whom shun sports and vigorous physical activity.
This  is  understandable  because  exercise  is  one  of  the  prime  causes  of  asthma  attacks.
Many parents, coaches, school administrators, and even physicians advise asthmatics to
avoid sports and normal physical education activities. Advances in medicine have ena-
bled asthmatics to excel in vigorous sports, even to the point of winning Olympic medals.

Two factors are important in preventing asthmatic attacks during and following exer-
cise—medication and environment. Modern medications enable asthmatics to partici-
pate in even the most vigorous sports by preventing exercise-induced asthma or reducing
its effects once they have occurred. If you suspect your young client has asthma, advise
the parents to take the child to a physician. In most instances asthmatics lead relatively
normal lives.

Environmental factors can cause an asthmatic attack. Modify or curtail exercise when
the  child  is  tired  or  under  excessive  emotional  stress,  on  cold,  foggy,  or  humid  days,
and during days with high smog and pollution levels. Swimming in cold pools can also
trigger an asthma attack. Under adverse environmental conditions, keep exercise bouts
short—less than three minutes at a time. However, the exercise levels should be adjusted
to individual tolerance.

SuMMARY

An athlete with a muscle or joint injury should not return to normal athletic play
until full strength, power, and range of motion have been restored. Movement
should have returned to normal without compensating limping movements,
and the child should be relatively pain free.

Overuse and overtraining injuries are often caused by doing too much, too
soon. Rest is important in overuse conditions and often produces better
performance than heavy training. Imbalance injuries can produce pains in the
knees, hips, and back. Such injuries are caused by poor posture, unbalanced
muscle groups, or anatomical abnormalities. Growth plate injuries are of
great concern in children’s sports. They can be caused by sudden traumatic
injuries from sports such as skiing or football, or by overuse in throwing sports
or running. Asthmatic children can participate in sports if they receive the
proper medication and are afforded individual consideration during adverse
environmental, physical, or emotional conditions.
