Advance Praise for Robert H. Lustig, M.D., and
Fat Chance
“Our eating habits are killing us. In this timely and important book, Dr. Robert Lustig
presents the scientific evidence for the toxicity of sugar and the disastrous effects of
modern industrial food on the hormones that control hunger, satiety, and weight. He
gives recommendations for a personal solution to the problem we face and also
suggests a public policy solution.
Fat Chance
 is the best book I’ve read on the
relationship between diet and health and the clearest explanation of epidemic obesity in
our society.”
—Andrew Weil, M.D., author of
Spontaneous Happiness
 and
You Can’t Afford to Get Sick
“
Fat Chance
 is an extraordinary achievement. Obesity’s causes, mechanisms, health
consequences, and preventive approaches are all devilishly complicated, but Dr.
Lustig’s outstanding contribution clarifies the complexity via a writing style that’s
accessible, insightful, and often gently humorous. Robert Lustig is a clinician, a
scientist, and an advocate—a combination that makes him uniquely qualified to bring
the condition’s many facets into sharp focus. Obesity has become the world’s number
one health problem.
Fat Chance
 is the book for all of us who must confront this
epidemic.”
—S. Boyd Eaton, M.D., Departments of Radiology and Anthropology,
Emory University, and father of the Paleo Diet movement
“
Fat Chance
 is
the
 manifesto for our time. It reveals the real reasons we why we are a
fat nation and how to cure the obesity epidemic. It gets right to the root of the problem,
which is not gluttony and sloth, as the food industry, government, and your neighbor
would have you believe. It is because we are drowning in a sea of sugar, which
poisons our metabolism, shrinks our brains, and threatens our national security and
global competitiveness. Every American, politician, teacher, and business leader must
read this book. Our nation’s future depends on it.”
—Mark Hyman, M.D., author of
The Blood Sugar Solution
“The obesity pandemic is well documented. But what can be done about it? More
importantly, when does a personal health issue rise to become a public health crisis? In
Fat Chance
, Dr. Robert Lustig examines the science of obesity to determine the role
that our current diet (especially too much sugar and too little fiber) plays in weight gain
and disease. Using that knowledge, he proposes changes in our personal, public, and
governmental attitudes to combat this scourge.
Fat Chance
 is a ‘savory’ read with a
‘sweet’ finish.”
—Sanjay Gupta, M.D., neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent
“No scientist has done more in the last fifty years to alert Americans to the potential
dangers of sugar in the diet than Dr. Robert Lustig.”
—Gary Taubes, author of
Good Calories, Bad Calories
 and
Why We Get Fat
“Robert Lustig is neither ringing an alarm bell nor giving us a gentle, paternalistic
nudge. His message is more authentic. He is a medical doctor issuing a prescription. In
order to address a current cocktail of health threats, Americans must alter their diets
and do so radically. Those alterations must begin with a dramatic reduction in the
consumption of sugars.”
—Alec Baldwin

This book is dedicated to all the obese patients worldwide who suffer daily, and the
family members who suffer with them. The children who will not know a normal
childhood, who will endure an inhuman existence, and will die a slow and early death.
The parents who are engulfed by guilt. The unborn children, who are already
imprisoned by changes in their brains and their bodies. But most of all, I dedicate this
book to those of you who are or have been my patients; for it is you who taught me the
science of your affliction. You also taught me more than medical school ever did or
could; and that each life is valuable, precious, and worth saving. You maintained your
dignity in the face of the most adverse circumstances imaginable. You shared with me
your misery, and your joy in small victories. We cried and we laughed together. I hope
I was of some service and comfort.
This book is my way of returning the favor.
This book is written only for those of you who eat food.
The rest of you are off the hook.

# Introduction
:
Time to Think Outside the Box
“We just eat too damn much.”
—Governor Tommy Thompson (R-Wisc.), U.S. Secretary of Health and
Human Services,
Today
, NBC, 2004
ndeed we do. That’s it, thanks for buying this book, you’ve been a great audience, I’m
outta here.
Well, that’s what the U.S. government would have you believe. All the major U.S.
governmental health agencies, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. Surgeon General, say that obesity results from
an energy imbalance: eating too many calories and not getting enough physical activity.
And they are right—to a point. Are we eating more? Of course. Are we exercising less?
No doubt. Despite knowing this, it hasn’t made any difference in the rates of obesity or
associated diseases. More to the point, how did this epidemic happen and in such a
short interval of just thirty years? People say, “The food is there,” and it is. But it was
there before. People say, “The TV is there,” and it is. But it was there before, and we
didn’t have this caloric catastrophe. There’s more to this story, way more, and it’s not
pretty.
Everyone blames everyone else for what has happened. No way is it
their
 fault. Big
Food says it’s a lack of activity due to computers and video games. The TV industry
says it’s our junk food diet. The Atkins people say it’s too many carbohydrates; the
Ornish people say it’s too much fat. The juice people say it’s the soda; the soda people
say it’s the juice. The schools
say it’s the parents; the parents say it’s the schools. And
since nothing is for sure, nothing is done. How do we reconcile all these opinions into a
cohesive whole that actually makes sense and creates changes for the better for each
individual and for all society? That’s what this book is about.
Food is not tobacco, alcohol, or street drugs. Food is sustenance. Food is survival.
Most important, food is pleasure. There are only two things that are more important
than food: air and water. Shelter’s a distant fourth. Food matters. Unfortunately, food
now matters even more than it should. Food is beyond a necessity; it’s also a
commodity, and it has been reformulated to be an addictive substance.
This has many effects on our world: economically, politically, socially, and
medically. There is a price to pay, and we’re paying it now. We pay with our taxes, our
insurance premiums, and our airline fares—nearly every bill we receive in the mail has
an obesity surcharge that we underwrite. We pay in misery, worsening school scores,
social devolution, and we pay in death. We pay for all of it, one way or another,
because the current food environment we have created does not match our
biochemistry, and this mismatch is at the heart of our medical, social, and financial
crisis. Worse yet, there is no medicine for this. There is no edict, ordinance,
legislation, tax, or law that can solve this alone. There is no quick fix, but the problem
is resolvable if we know what’s really going on—and if we really want to resolve it.
In his 2004 book
Food Fight
, Kelly Brownell of Yale University talks about
obesity and the “toxic environment” we now live in, a euphemism for our collective
bad behaviors. I am going a step further. I’m interested in whether there is something
actually toxic, I mean
poisonous
, going on here. Even laboratory animal colonies have
been getting fatter over the past twenty years!
Every good story needs a villain. While I am loath to reveal it this early in the
book, I won’t keep you in suspense. It’s sugar—the Professor Moriarty of this story, a
substance that now permeates nearly all food and drink worldwide. It’s killing us…
slowly, and I’ll prove it. Every statement throughout this book is based on scientific
study, historical fact, or recent statistics.
I’m a physician. We take an oath:
primum non nocere
 (first do no harm).
But
there’s a paradox in this statement: when you know the final disposition—that the
outcome is going to be bad—then doing nothing is causing harm.
I certainly did not start out as an advocate. I wasn’t looking for a fight. I didn’t
come to this controversy with a preconceived agenda. Indeed, I was fifteen years into
my medical career before I stepped up to deal with obesity as an issue. Until 1995, like
my medical colleagues, I did my best to avoid seeing obese patients. I had nothing to
tell them except “it’s your fault” and “eat less and exercise more.” At that time, seeing
an obese child with type 2 diabetes was an anomaly. Now it is an almost everyday
occurrence. The problem of obesity is now inescapable in medical practice. You can’t
avoid it any more.
The concepts elaborated here didn’t just wake me from sleep one day in a divine
revelation. This book is the culmination of sixteen years of medical research, medical
meetings, academic discourse with colleagues, journal clubs, policy analysis, and a
whole lot of patient care. I have no conflict of interest in espousing the information
here; I am not a pawn of the food industry or a mouthpiece for any organization. Unlike
many authors addressing the devastation of obesity, I don’t have a product line designed
to enrich my bank account. I came by these views honestly and through rigorous data
analysis. And the data are out there for everyone to examine. I’m just putting them
together somewhat differently.
As a scientist, I have personally contributed to the understanding of the regulation of
energy balance. As a pediatrician, I get to watch the interaction between genetics and
environment that causes obesity play out in my examining room every day. And now, as
a fledgling policy wonk, I have seen how the changes in our society have sprouted this
global pandemic. It is this panoramic view that allows me to connect the dots for you,
and they don’t connect in the way you’ve been told.
To blame obesity on the obese is the easy answer, but it is the
wrong
 answer. The
current formulation of gluttony and sloth, diet and exercise, while accepted by virtually
everyone, is based on faulty premises and myths that have taken hold in the world’s
consciousness. Obesity is not a behavioral aberration, a character flaw, or an error of
commission. When we think about the ravages of obesity, our minds often go first to
adults. But
what about kids? One quarter of U.S children are now obese; even infants
are tipping the scales! Children don’t choose to be obese. They are victims, not
perpetrators. Once you understand the science, you realize what applies to children
also applies to grown-ups. I know what you’re thinking: adults are responsible for their
own choices and for the food they give their children. But are they?
An esteemed colleague involved in the obesity wars once said to me, “I don’t care
what’s causing the obesity epidemic. I just want to know what to do about it.” I
respectfully disagree. In order to pull ourselves out of this ditch, we have to understand
how we drove into it. Indeed, our current thinking is based on correlation, supposition,
and conjecture. I wrote this book to persuade you, the reader, to take up this cause, for
your own health and for our country’s. However, you can’t truly advocate for a cause
unless you know what is going on. And you can’t disagree with me until you know all
the facts. And that means the science. After you’ve read this book, if you think it’s a
crock or that I’m a crank, tell me. I want to know. In fact, I’ll make a promise to you
right now: there is not one statement made in this entire book that can’t be backed up by
hard science. My reputation in the field is built on the science. It’s also my protection
against those who would try to discredit me, including the food industry and, as you
will see, the federal government. Indeed, it’s the only reason I haven’t been discredited
yet. And I won’t be, because I stick to the science. Now and forever.
However, in four places in the book, I let my imagination run wild. I will try to
explain how obesity fits within the process of evolution, how our evolutionary
biochemistry works to keep us alive, and finally how our food environment has altered
that biochemistry to promote this global catastrophe. These fits of speculation will
carry the section heading “Deconstructing Darwin.”
This book is targeted at the patients who suffer, the doctors who suffer along with
them, the U.S. electorate who pays for this debacle, the politicians who must take up
arms to dig us out of the mess that has been created out of our economy and our health,
and the rest of the world, so they don’t make the same mistakes (although they already
have).
In
Part 1
 of this book, I will challenge some of the theories you’re used to hearing in
the media, and indeed from the medical
profession. Parts 2 and 3 will focus on the
science of obesity, and how the body deals with energy burning versus storage. No, you
don’t need to be a biology or medical expert to understand the science. I’ve worked
hard to reduce it down to its essence, and to keep it interesting, light, and accessible. In
Part 2
, I’ll also explain how your brain has developed, evolutionarily and
in utero
, to
thwart your attempts at dieting. You truly are hormonal when it comes to the foods you
crave, just not in the ways you think.
Part 3
 will elaborate on the science of fat tissue,
and when and how it can make you sick. In
Part 4
, I will prove that our current
environment is indeed “toxic.” I will show how the “American diet,” which is now the
“industrial global diet,” is killing us…slowly. I will identify the poison and the
antidotes, why those antidotes work, and why they’ve been added to or removed from
our diet for the food industry’s purposes.
Part 5
 elaborates what you, as an individual,
can do to protect yourself and your family by changing your “personal environment.”
Finally, in
Part 6
, I argue that governments around the world have been co-opted by the
food industry, and I will outline how they must instead partner with the populace and
exert influence over the food industry to stop the obesity pandemic before we all reach
the medical and financial Armageddon now within sight.
# Part I
The Greatest Story Ever Sold
Chapter 1
O
A Fallacy of Biblical Proportion
Juan, a 100-pound six-year-old Latino boy whose mother is a non-
English-speaking farm worker from Salinas, California, comes to my
clinic in 2003. He is wider than he is tall. I ask the mother in my broken
Spanish, “I don’t care what your kid eats, tell me what he drinks.” No
soda, but a gallon of orange juice per day. On calories alone, this
accounts for 112 pounds per year of body fat. Of course, some of that is
burned off, and it might influence total food intake. I explain to the
mother, “
La fruta es buena, el jugo es malo
 (the fruit is good, the juice
is bad). Eat the fruit, don’t drink the juice.” She asks, “Then why does
WIC [Women, Infants, and Children, a government entitlement program
for the poor run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture] give it to us?”
ne kid, one mother, one question, my life was changed—and the need for this book
was born. Why
does
 WIC give it to them? There is real science behind our
worldwide obesity catastrophe. And science should drive policy, but as you will see,
the politics get in the way. This is the most complex issue facing the human race this
side of the Middle East conflict. And it has become incrementally more complicated
over time, with multitudes of stakeholders with set agendas, and bigger than the
individual parties involved. Devoid of simple solutions, it has destroyed families and
claimed the lives of countless people.
You can’t pick up a newspaper or log on to the Internet without seeing some new
statistic on the obesity pandemic. It’s all obesity, all the time. And how many of them
have something good to report? You can bet that any tabloid headline is about one of
two things—either the statistics are getting worse or another obesity drug was denied
or withdrawn by the Food and Drug Administration. I’m sure you’re sick of it. I know I
am. And weight loss has turned into a blood sport—just tune in to
The Biggest Loser
.
In 2001,
Newsweek
 reported that six million kids in America were seriously
overweight. We have tripled that number in a decade, and the numbers are now
surpassing twenty million. Yet for all the media attention, visibility, discussion, and
weight loss programs, even Michelle Obama can’t put the genie back in the bottle.
While we’re getting fatter, we’re also getting sicker. Our risk for illness is
increasing faster than the increase in obesity. Indeed, the cluster of chronic metabolic
diseases termed metabolic syndrome—which includes obesity, type 2 diabetes,
hypertension (high blood pressure), lipid (blood fat) disorders, and cardiovascular
(heart) disease—is snowballing by leaps and bounds. And then there are the other
obesity-associated metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, kidney
disease, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Add to that the other comorbidities (related
medical conditions) associated with obesity, such as orthopedic problems, sleep apnea,
gallstones, and depression, and the medical devastation associated with the obesity
pandemic is staggering. Every one of these diseases has become more prevalent over
the past thirty years. What’s more, all of them are now found in children as young as
five years old. We even have an epidemic of obese six-month-olds!

The human damage in this scourge of metabolic syndrome is showing. In 2005 one
study showed that despite the increased availability of medical care, our children will
be the first generation of Americans who will die earlier than their forebears.

 The
study placed the blame squarely on the obesity epidemic. In the United States, quality-
adjusted life years lost to obesity have more than doubled from 1993 to 2008.
Emergency rooms are taking care of forty-year-old heart attack victims. Teens with type
2 diabetes used to be unheard of; now they are one third of all new diagnoses of
diabetes. In the United States alone, 160,000 bariatric surgeries
(to reduce the size of
the stomach) are performed per year, at an average cost of $30,000 per surgery. Over
40 percent of death certificates now list diabetes as the cause of death, up from 13
percent twenty years ago.
The loss in American productivity due to time off from work is staggering, the
waste in medical expenditures ($147 billion per year) is breaking the bank, and this
amount is predicted to increase to $192 billion by the end of the decade. Guess what?
There’s no money to pay for it all. The Affordable Care Act (ACA, or “Obamacare”) is
going to put thirty-two million sick people on the insurance rolls by 2019. The
president says we’ll make up for the costs in savings from preventative care. However,
it is unlikely to improve our health in any significant way, as there are no provisions for
the prevention of chronic disease, most notably those that attend obesity. How do you
prevent all the ravages of chronic metabolic disease when we bust the scales and when
the statistics show no sign of improvement? It’s often been said that we wouldn’t need
health care reform if we had obesity reform.
It would be one thing if obesity were an isolated problem in America, but it’s
happening everywhere. The obesity pandemic has expanded the world’s collective
waistline. The World Health Organization (WHO) has shown that the percentage of
obese humans globally has doubled in the past twenty-eight years. In fact, obesity’s
contribution to the burden of chronic disease has been equal to if not greater than that of
smoking. Even people in developing countries are obese. After only one decade, there
are now 30 percent more people who are obese than are undernourished worldwide.
The WHO reported in 2008 that approximately 1.5 billion adults were overweight and
at least 400 million were obese globally

; these numbers are projected to reach about
2.3 billion and 700 million, respectively, by 2015. In September 2011 the UN General
Assembly declared that non-communicative diseases (diabetes, cancer, and heart
disease) are now a greater threat to world health than are infectious diseases, including
in the developing world (see
chapter 22
). Is the whole world now composed of gluttons
and sloths? Over the next fifteen years, these diseases will cost low- and middle-
income countries more than $7 trillion.

 People are dying earlier, and national
economies are losing billions of dollars in lost productivity while governments pay for
the medical expenditures. Millions
of families end up in poverty, guaranteeing that the
cycle will not be reversed.
For the 55 percent of adults who are overweight or obese, listen up. I’m talking to
you
, at a doctor-to-patient level, at a person-to-person level. Obesity is not an
automatic death sentence. A full 20 percent of morbidly obese persons are
metabolically healthy and have normal life spans.

 As for the other 80 percent, you
don’t have to be in poor health; everyone has it within his reach to improve his health
and regain those years the actuaries say will be lost. But success in doing so depends
on identifying the cause of the problem, assessing your metabolic risk, and changing
your biochemistry. Okay, full disclosure: despite your best efforts, you may never lose
your stubborn subcutaneous fat (the fat that pads your thighs and derrière). And if you
do, you’ll gain it back in short order—unless you become a gym rat, because vigorous
exercise is the only rational way to prevent weight regain (see
chapter 13
). In fact, if
you lose meaningful amounts of subcutaneous fat and keep it off for more than a year,
I’ll be shocked. Pleasantly so, but shocked nonetheless.
For the 45 percent of adults who are normal weight, pay attention. You either sneer
at or pity the other 55 percent of your brethren who take up two seats on the bus. You
look down on them as weak, overindulgent, and lazy. You resent them, and you show it
financially and socially. You’re indignant that they cost you money. And you think
you’re out of the woods and home free. You’ve been told that you’ll live a long and
happy life. Whatever you’re doing, it must be right. For those of you who are
“naturally” thin, you’ve been told that you have great genes and can consume all the soft
drinks and Twinkies you want without gaining a pound or getting sick. Would that it
were true. A few years ago, you were the majority of Americans. Now you’re the
minority. And you’re losing your percentage year by year.
This means that many of you are flipping—that is, gaining weight and going over to
the dark side. Indeed, current projections suggest that by 2030, the United States will be
65 percent overweight and 165 million American adults will be obese.

 The 2008
movie
Wall-E
 is a prophecy: that’s where we’re all headed. We’ll all be so fat, we’ll
have to ride around on little scooters, just like at Walmart. And as you get older, your
risk for gaining weight keeps going up. Your genes won’t change, but your
biochemistry
will. So, if you’re flipping (which more and more of you are), something must be
sending you over to the “dark side.” And if that’s not your fate, it will be that of your
children. Nobody knows this better than I, because I take care of those children every
day.
Here’s the kicker. Being thin is not a safeguard against metabolic disease or early
death. Up to 40 percent of normal-weight individuals harbor insulin resistance—a sign
of chronic metabolic disease—which will likely shorten their life expectancy. Of those,
20 percent demonstrate liver fat on an MRI of the abdomen (see
chapter 8
).

 Liver fat,
irrespective of body fat, has been shown to be a major risk factor in the development of
diabetes. You think you’re safe? You are
so
 screwed. And you don’t even know it.
The overriding thesis of this book is that your fat is not your fate—provided you
don’t surrender. Because people don’t die of obesity per se. They die of what happens
to their organs. On the death certificate, the medical examiner doesn’t write down
“obesity”; instead it’s “heart attack,” “heart failure,” “stroke,” “diabetes,” “cancer,”
“dementia,” or “cirrhosis of the liver.” These are diseases that “travel” with obesity.
They are all chronic metabolic diseases. But normal-weight people die of these as
well.
That’s the point.
 It’s not the obesity. The obesity is not the
cause
 of chronic
metabolic disease. It’s a
marker
 of chronic metabolic disease, otherwise known as
metabolic syndrome. And it’s metabolic syndrome that will kill you. Understanding this
distinction is crucial to improving your health, no matter your size. Obesity and
metabolic syndrome overlap, but they are different. Obesity doesn’t kill. Metabolic
syndrome kills. Although they travel together, one doesn’t cause the other. But then,
what causes obesity? And what causes metabolic syndrome? And what can you do
about each? Read on.
I wrote this book to help you and your kids get healthy and improve your quality of
life, increase your productivity, and reduce the world’s waste of medical resources. If
you get thin in the process, great. But if that’s what you expect, go find your own diet
guru, and good luck with that. Want to get healthier? Want to get happier? Want to get
smarter? It’s your visceral (around your abdominal organs) fat and hepatic (liver) fat
that’s keeping you down. And getting rid of visceral fat is not as hard as you might
think. This is the more metabolically active fat, and there’s plenty you can do to shrink
it.
A proverb says, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” This
book is a journey into the workings of the body. It is a journey into the biochemistry of
our brains and our fat cells. It is a journey into evolution, the mismatch between our
environment and our biochemistry. And it is a journey into the world of business and
politics, too. This journey starts with a single but very large step, in which we abandon
our current thinking of obesity by challenging the age-old dogma “
a calorie is a
calorie
.”
Chapter 2
W
A Calorie Is a Calorie—or Is It?
“If folks want to maintain a healthy weight, they have to be sensitive to
the calories in and calories out…Not every calorie is the same.”
—Governor Tom Vilsack (D-Iowa), U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, upon
release of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines, January 13, 2011
ait a second. If people have to be sensitive to calories in and out, then why aren’t
calories the same? Does anyone see the contradiction here? This was the first time
that any government official had even remotely hinted that calories might not be
interchangeable, and it was buried in this cryptic double-speak.
Everyone is a dietitian. Everyone thinks he or she understands obesity. Believe it or
not, this is one of the harder medical conditions to comprehend. Why? Obesity is a
combination of several factors: physics, biochemistry, endocrinology, neuroscience,
psychology, sociology, and environmental health, all rolled up into one problem. The
factors that drive the obesity pandemic are almost as myriad as the number of people
who suffer from it.
The Venus Von Willendorf is an eleven-inch statue carbon-dated to 22,000
BCE
 that
was unearthed in Austria in 1908 (see
figure 2.1
). It depicts the torso of a morbidly
obese adult woman. This shows us that the ancients knew about obesity long before
they knew about fast food. There are other ways to gain weight aside from potato chips
and pizza, soda and suds. The medical literature lists at least thirty diagnoses that
include obesity as a symptom. These include problems of the brain, liver, and adipose
(fat)
tissue; genetic disorders; various hormonal imbalances; and the effects of certain
medications.
But none of these medical causes explain what’s happened to the world’s
population over the last thirty years. Until 1980, statistically only 15 percent of the
adult population had a body mass index—or BMI, an indicator of body fatness that is
calculated from a person’s weight and height—above the eighty-fifth percentile,
indicating either overweight or obesity. Now that statistic is 55 percent. And by 2030
it’s expected to be 65 percent.

 Something’s happened in the last thirty years, but what?
Fig. 2.1. A Venus FatTrap.
 The Venus von Willendorf is an 11-cm-high statuette of a female that carbon-dates to
between 24,000 and 22,000
BCE
. It was discovered in 1908 in Austria, and is on display in the Naturhistorisches
Museum in Vienna. It shows that obesity is as old as man (or woman) himself.
The First Law
In order to understand obesity, and energy balance in general, we must acquaint
ourselves with the first law of thermodynamics, which states, “The total energy inside a
closed system remains constant.” For you math and science geeks:
U = Q – W
where U is the internal energy of a system, Q is the heat supplied by the system, and W
is the work done by the system. Work and heat are due to processes that either add or
subtract energy; when work = heat, the internal energy stays constant. The first law is a
law
. It is elegant and airtight. If you don’t like it, file a grievance with Sir Isaac
Newton. I subscribe to the first law. The basis for our current understanding of the
causes and consequences of the obesity pandemic lies not with the first law itself, but
rather in how you interpret it, for, as with all laws, there is plenty of room for
alternative interpretations.
The prevailing wisdom on the first law can be summed up by one widely held
dogma:
a calorie is a calorie
. That is, to maintain energy balance and body weight (the
U in the equation), one calorie eaten (the Q) must be offset by one calorie burned (the
W). The calorie eaten can come from anywhere, from meat to vegetables to cheesecake.
The calorie burned can go to anywhere, from sleeping to watching TV to vigorous
exercise. And from this dogma comes the standard and widely held interpretation of the
first law: “If you eat it, you had better burn it, or you will store it.” In this
interpretation, the behaviors of increased energy intake and decreased energy
expenditure are primary (and presumably learned); therefore, the weight gained is a
secondary result. Thus, obesity is routinely thought to be the natural consequence of
these “aberrant behaviors.” As you will see hereafter, virtually all the stakeholders in
the obesity pandemic have signed up on the side of personal responsibility.
The Seating Chart at the Table of Blame
The Head of the Table: The Gluttons and the Sloths
Personal responsibility occupies the biggest seat at the Table of Blame. The common
assumption in obesity hinges on its being a personal choice: We control what we eat
and how much we exercise. If you are obese, it must be because you chose to either eat
more, exercise less, or both. Over the past twenty-five years, various government
agencies have accumulated ample
evidence of the increased caloric intake during that
time frame, both in children and in adults. During this time, the CDC has documented
that Americans have increased their caloric consumption by an extra 187 calories per
day for men, 335 calories per day for women. The behaviors associated with the rise in
obesity include increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and decreased
consumption of whole fruits, vegetables, and other sources of dietary fiber. On a
societal level, obesity is also associated with less breastfeeding, skipped breakfasts,
fewer family meals, and more fast food dining. Alternatively, a wealth of evidence
supports a role for decreased physical activity and increased “screen time” (TV,
computers, video games, and texting) in causing obesity.
It is from this perception of choice that we derive our current societal mantras
around obesity: gluttony and sloth, two of the original “seven deadly sins.” I should
note here that people exhibiting the other five deadly sins (greed, pride, lust, envy, and
wrath) have gotten a pass in the press and in society as a whole. They are frequently
extolled in the media—just watch the reality shows
The Apprentice
 (envy, greed, pride,
wrath—“You’re Fired!”),
Millionaire Matchmaker
 (lust, greed, pride), or
Jersey
Shore
 (all known sins and then some).
We’ve found absolution for nearly every vice and sin we can commit, except for
these two. They continue to defy our society’s ability to forgive. This despite the fact
that 55 percent of Americans are either overweight or obese. Thin people are now in
the minority, yet our culture continues to punish the majority. The average woman in the
United States wears a size 14, yet many stores do not carry anything above a size 10.
Although many women’s clothing stores now have “vanity sizes” (what was a size 10 in
1950 is now labeled a size 6), a large percentage of the population still can’t find
anything on the rack. Approximately ten years ago in San Francisco, a billboard
advertising the local 24-Hour Fitness health club depicted an extraterrestrial with the
tag line “When they come, they’ll eat the fat ones first.”
Our society continues to glorify thinness even though it appears to be less
achievable every year. Those of us who are overweight or obese are immediately
assumed to be gluttons and/or sloths. The obese are passed over for employment
because it’s assumed they’ll be as lazy on the job as they are in caring for their bodies.
They are among the last groups about
which you can still make pejorative comments in
public. From this condemnation, it’s a quick jump to the determination that obese
people became so due to a behavioral defect. This formulation serves many purposes. It
certainly justifies society’s desire to place blame.
Even the obese have bought into the thesis of personal responsibility (see
chapter

). They would prefer to be portrayed as “perpetrator” rather than “victim.” If you’re
a perpetrator, you maintain control and make your own choices, which is more hopeful
than the alternative. If, instead, you’re a victim, you have no power, obesity is your fate,
and there is no hope. You’re doomed, which is far more depressing. Finally, “personal
responsibility” serves as the cornerstone of both the government’s and the insurance
companies’ restriction of obesity care delivery.
Seat 2: The Health Insurance Industry
Much of the public views doctors as moneymaking mountebanks who care less for their
patients than for their wallets. Well, we lose money on every patient we see. While our
hospital’s general pediatric health insurance reimbursement averages 37.5 cents on the
dollar (a pittance), our pediatric obesity clinic collects only 29.0 cents per dollar
billed. The reason for this? The health insurance industry refuses to pay for obesity
services, saying, “Obesity is a behavior, a flaw in your character, a psychological
aberration. And we don’t pay for behavior.” This is the reason that, despite having
enough business many times over, childhood obesity clinics and treatment programs are
closing across the country. The insurance industry has decided that obesity is a lifestyle
choice; therefore, it won’t pay. And when insurance companies do pay, they pay the
absolute minimum.
The insurance industry hates this obesity epidemic almost as much as we doctors
do. They are hunkering down for a long siege. Why do they continue to deny
reimbursement for obesity services? Because if they paid for all the services required
by today’s pandemic, it would break their piggybank. Instead, they keep plugging holes
in the dike by ascribing blame to the individual. They know that if they ever admit that
obesity is the fault of no one person, the waters will engulf them all.
Seat 3: The Medical Profession
Twenty years ago, obesity was a social issue, not a medical one. At the beginning of my
career, a colleague in pediatric endocrinology (the study of hormones in children)
would send a form letter to the parents of children referred for obesity that read, “Dear
parent, thank you for your interest in our pediatric endocrinology division. Your child
has been referred for obesity. Obesity is a problem of nutrition and activity, not one of
endocrinology. We suggest that you seek general advice from your child’s
pediatrician.” And despite the undeniable onslaught of patients referred, many of my
colleagues still feel this way.
As the problems have soared and the research dollars have poured in, the American
Diabetes Association (ADA), the American Heart Association (AHA), and countless
others professional organizations have devoted a substantial portion of their agendas to
the obesity pandemic. The standard mantra espoused by the medical establishment is,
“Lifestyle causes obesity, and obesity causes metabolic syndrome.” We doctors
recognize our role in mitigating the negative effects of obesity. But, again, for most
physicians, the behaviors come first. The fault still lies with the patient.
Seat 4: The Obesity Profiteers
They say, “You’re weak. You’ve failed. Let us help you.” They profess to have the
answer for your obesity problem and are peddling one solution or another. They are the
obesity profiteers, and they represent large and vast industries, most of which are
ostensibly trying to “do the right thing,” while making a fortune in the process. We have
the otherwise reputable peer-group weight-loss programs such as Weight Watchers and
Jenny Craig, which strongly recommend the option of buying their trademarked cuisine
(often loaded with sodium) to bolster profits. There are the diet supplement people
such as Nutri-System, who demand that you purchase their food if you want to see
results. Gym programs such as Curves and 24-Hour Fitness charge initiation and
renewal fees for membership. Then there are the companies that make home exercise
equipment. Their late-night infomercials invariably show a buff guy stretching a rubber
band with the implicit message, “You can look like this if you stretch a rubber band.”
And then we have the “obesity authors” (gee, I’m one now!).
Some are M.D.s, some
Ph.D.s, some journalists, some pop culture phenomena, and some charlatans (none of
which is mutually exclusive). All profess to have the answer to your obesity problem,
peddling one diet or another. A few of these authors have developed corporations that
want to sell you their food line, such as Atkins or the Zone. And each provides just
enough science and nuggets of truth to hook the public.
Some weight-loss doctors and clinics peddle prescription appetite suppressants or
other weight-loss remedies—all of which are paid for out of pocket. Some of these
doctors are reputable and brilliant academics at medical universities who are trying to
save people’s lives while studying the physiology of obesity. Some are surgeons who
perform liposuction for cosmetic purposes and bariatric surgery for metabolic and
cardiac rescue. But some of them are “cut-and-run” surgeons operating out of small
airplanes and flying around to little towns to perform quickie lap-band surgeries or
gastric bypasses. They take their victims’ money, have no quality control, never see the
patient in follow-up, and sometimes leave medical catastrophes in their wake.
While the insurance companies refuse to shell out funds for this problem, the
research money is pouring in. The pharmaceutical industry has spent a lot of money to
come up with the “obesity blockbuster,” that magic bullet that will work long-term and
for everyone. But that’s a pipe dream because, first, obesity isn’t one disease, it’s
many; second, our bodies have many redundant pathways to maintain our critical energy
balance, so one drug can’t possibly be effective for everyone; and third, there’s no one
drug that will treat metabolic syndrome (see
chapter 19
).
Each of these people and industries have one thing in common: they are trying to
make a buck off the misfortunes of the obese, to the tune of $117 billion a year. And
they’re all charging retail. Out of pocket, cash on the barrelhead. No insurance
reimbursements here. No discounts. In case you hadn’t noticed, the obese will do
anything
 not to be obese, even throw their money away on “get-thin-quick” schemes.
That’s why these industries are the obesity profiteers. Do any of their “solutions”
work? Fat chance. If you just did what they told you, the fat would magically disappear.
If it fails, it’s your fault—you must have been noncompliant! Yet another reason for the
obese to be depressed. Think about it—if any of these books, diets, or programs
actually worked for the entire population, there would be only one. The person who
makes this discovery will likely win the Nobel Prize, move to a mansion in Tahiti, and
be featured on
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
.
Seat 5: The Fat Activists
There’s nothing socially or medically wrong with being fit and fat; you’re doing better
than the people out there who are thin and sedentary. But there is something medically
wrong with being fat and
sick.
 Especially if you’re suffering metabolically, which 80
percent of obese people are. If you fall into this category, you are costing society money
in caring for your metabolic illnesses, reducing productivity, and clogging up (and
bringing down) the health care system. Not to mention digging yourself an early grave!
The vocal proponents for the political and social rights of the obese, primarily the
National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA), say, “Being fat is a badge
of honor. Be fit and fat, be fat and proud.” No victimization here. And I agree. But
NAAFA also tries to stop academic obesity research—because why would you
investigate a condition that is totally normal? For example, NAAFA sits on the board of
the San Francisco Unified School District, where it prevents obesity research from
being conducted within the city’s schools. Why? They don’t think attention should be
paid to how much kids weigh. This is puzzling to me. There is something highly
paradoxical about enabling your child to be fat and sick. The majority of obese kids
will be diabetic and cardiac cripples by the time they’re fifty. The science and research
that NAAFA seeks to block are critical to studying this epidemic and determining what
we can do about it. It’s my job as a pediatrician to protect these kids from such
misguided thinking.
Seat 6: The Commercial Food Industry
The commercial food industry responds to the obesity pandemic with two mantras.
First, “Everyone is responsible for what goes into his or her mouth.” Is that true? What
goes into our mouths depends on two things: selectivity and access. Second, “Any food
can be part of a balanced diet.” True but irrelevant because, thanks to the food industry,
we don’t have a balanced diet, and they’re the ones that unbalanced it. They are a major
instigator of the obesity pandemic through both their actions and the kind of rhetoric
they use to justify those
actions. Corporations repeatedly say one thing, yet do another.
McDonald’s now advertises a healthier menu, with commercials featuring slim people
in exercise clothes eating salads. However, the vast majority of people entering
McDonald’s, even if they come in with the idea of eating a salad, instead order a Big
Mac and fries. And McDonald’s is well aware of this. Its recent billboard campaign,
“Crafted for Your Craving,” says all you need to know. Carl’s Jr.’s promotion of the
“Western Bacon Six Dollar Burger,” which has a whopping 1,030 calories and 55
grams of fat, generally depicts fit and attractive people consuming the company’s fare
with relish. Do you really think they would continue to be thin if they ate this on a
regular basis?
Food has become a commodity (see
chapter 21
), with foodstuffs that can be stored
being traded on the various commodities exchanges. Speculators can corner the market
on anything, from pork bellies to orange juice, by betting how much the price will rise
and fall. And it’s because individual foods are treated as commodities that the
downstream effects of changes in the food supply, and subsequently food prices, are
being felt worldwide (see
chapter 21
). Cheap food means political stability. There is
an imperative to keep food highly available and the prices as low as possible.
Everyone is
for
 cheap food. The United States spends 7 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP) on food, which allows the populace to buy more DVDs and iPads and
take more vacations. But cheaper food, loaded with preservatives for longer shelf life,
costs you on the tail end, and way more than all your gadgets and vacations put together
(with interest).
Seat 7: The Federal Government
Our government is extraordinarily conflicted about where it should stand on the obesity
pandemic. In 2003, former U.S. surgeon general Richard Carmona stated that obesity
was an issue of national security, a stance that current surgeon general Regina Benjamin
has upheld (despite the fact that she herself is obese) and one to which the U.S. Army
has signed on. The public health branches of the government tell us that we eat too much
and exercise too little. Mrs. Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign centers on the idea that
childhood obesity can be battled by planting school vegetable gardens, encouraging
kids to get out and exercise, and remaking the School Nutrition Act.
All necessary, but
not sufficient
.
The U.S. government does everything it can to keep food
cheap (see
chapter 16
).
The USDA has chosen not to accept any responsibility for its role in the obesity
pandemic, continuing to market our Western diet around the world. The Farm Bill (see
chapter 21
) maintains food subsidies to keep farmers employed and growing more
crops. The growers make their profits on volume. The food processors make big
markups and pass them along to the consumer. And the USDA subsidizes food
entitlement programs to the poor, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps) and the Women, Infants, and
Children nutrition program (or WIC, which supplies low-income infants and their
mothers with food and health care), to keep them alive and complacent. Until 2007,
WIC bowed to the pressure of food lobbyists. The foodstuffs provided were largely
unhealthy, and included white bread and high-sugar juices.
The “Food Pyramid,” the federal nutrition guide released in 1974 (see
figure 2.2a
)
and revised every five years, cultimating with “MyPyramid” in 2005, was never based
on science. Indeed it was top and bottom heavy—hardly a pyramid. In response to calls
for revision from many in the medical community, the Food Pyramid was deep-sixed in
2011. “MyPyramid” has now morphed into “MyPlate” (see
figure 2.2b
). The most
recent guidance from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), released in
2010, says that obesity is a problem (shocker) so we should all eat less fat, sugar, and
salt. We’re all supposed to eat more fruits and vegetables, and less of everything else.
This is stating the obvious. Don’t we already know this? Eat less? How? If we
could
eat less, there wouldn’t be an obesity pandemic. But we can’t.
Fig. 2.2a. The Ancient Pyramids.
 The traditional USDA Food Pyramid, circa 2005, which advised us to eat more
grains and less fat and sugar. Alongside it, what Americans actually ate—more like an hourglass than a pyramid.
Fig. 2.2b. The Modern Merry-Go-Round.
 Under pressure from consumer groups and in response to the emerging
science, the Pyramid was relegated to ancient history, and MyPlate was adopted by the USDA in 2011. MyPlate
advises us to eat approximately half a plate of vegetables or fruits, one quarter fiber-containing starch such as brown
rice, and one quarter protein, preferably low-fat. It’s too early to tell if this change will have any effect on American
eating habits.
Each of the stakeholders in the obesity pandemic is singing the same tune: “Your
obesity is your personal responsibility, it’s your fault, and you’ve failed.” And all these
accusations are a variation on a theme based on one unflappable dogma:
a calorie is a
calorie.
Calories Don’t Count If…
The clues are all around us as to what’s really happened. It’s time to look at where
those extra calories went, because it is in these data that we will find the answer to the
obesity dilemma.
There are three problems with “
a calorie is a calorie.
”
First, there is no way anyone could actually burn off the calories supplied by our
current food supply. A chocolate chip cookie has the equivalent calories of twenty
minutes of jogging, and working off a Big Mac would require
four hours
 of biking. But,
wait! Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps eats 12,000 calories a day and burns them off,
right? If this were the case for all of us, diet and exercise should work—you’d burn
more than you ate and lose weight (see
chapter 13
). And diet drugs should work—you
take the drug, eat or absorb less, and lose the pounds. Except the meds don’t deliver on
their promises. They work for a brief period, and then patients reach a plateau in
weight loss (see
chapter 4
).

 Why? Do the patients stop taking the pills? No. So why do
the medications stop working? The answer: because the body is smarter than the brain
is. Energy expenditure is reduced to meet the decreased energy intake. So a calorie is
not
 really a calorie, because your caloric output is controlled by your body and is
dependent on the quantity
and
 the quality of the calories ingested.
Second, if
a calorie is a calorie,
 then all fats would be the same because they’d
each release 9.0 calories per gram of energy when burned. But they’re not all the same.
There are good fats (which have valuable properties, such as being anti-inflammatory)
and bad fats (which can cause heart disease and fatty liver disease; see
chapter 10
).
Likewise, all proteins and amino acids should be the same, since they release 4.1
calories per gram of energy when burned. Except that we have high-quality protein
(such as egg protein), which may reduce appetite, and we have low-quality protein
(hamburger meat), which is full of branched-chain amino acids (see
chapter 9
), which
has been associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.

 Finally, all
carbohydrates should be the same, since they also release 4.1 calories per gram of
energy when burned. But they’re not. A closer look at the specific breakdown of the
carbohydrate data reveals something interesting. There are two classes of
carbohydrate: starch and sugar. Starch is made up of glucose only, which is not very
sweet and which every cell in the body can use for energy. Although there are several
other “sugars” (glucose, galactose, maltose, and lactose), when I talk about sugar here
(and in the rest of this book), I am talking about the “sweet” stuff, sucrose and high-
fructose corn syrup, which both contain the molecule fructose. Fructose is
very
 sweet
and is inevitably metabolized to fat (see
chapter 11
). It
is the primary (although not the
sole) villain, the Darth Vader of the Empire, beckoning you to the dark side in this
sordid tale.
The third problem with “
a calorie is a calorie
” is illustrated by the U.S. secretary
of health and human services Tommy Thompson’s admonishment in 2004 that we’re
“eating too damn much,” would suggest that we’re eating more of everything. But we’re
not eating more of
everything.
 We’re eating more of some things and less of others.
And it is in those “some things” that we will find our answer to the obesity pandemic.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture keeps track of nutrient disappearance. These data
show that
total

consumption
 of protein and fat remained relatively constant as the
obesity pandemic accelerated. Yet, due to the “low-fat” directives in the 1980s of the
AMA, AHA, and USDA, the intake of fat declined as a
percentage of total calories
(from 40 percent to 30 percent). Protein intake remained relatively constant at 15
percent. But if total calories increased, yet the total consumption of fat was unchanged,
that means something had to go up. Examination of the carbohydrate data provides the
answer. As a percentage of total caloric intake, the intake of carbohydrates increased
from 40 percent to 55 percent.

 While it’s true we are eating more of both classes of
carbohydrate (starch and sugar), our total starch intake has risen from just 49 to 51
percent of calories. Yet our fructose intake has increased from 8 percent to 12 percent
to, in some cases (especially among children), 15 percent of total calories. So it stands
to reason that what we’re eating more of is sugar, specifically fructose. Our
consumption of fructose has doubled in the past thirty years and has increased sixfold in
the last century. The answer to our global dilemma lies in understanding the causes and
effects of this change in our diet.
There’s one lesson to conclude from these three contradictions to the current
dogma.
A calorie is not a calorie
. Rather, perhaps the dogma should be restated thus: a
calorie burned
is
 a calorie burned, but a calorie eaten
is not
 a calorie eaten. And
therein lies the key to understanding the obesity pandemic. The quality of what we eat
determines the quantity. It also determines our desire to burn it. And personal
responsibility? Just another urban myth to be busted by real science.
Chapter 3
I
Personal Responsibility
versus the Obese Six-Month-Old
Sienna is a one-year-old girl who weighs 44 pounds. She was 10
pounds at birth and was delivered by caesarean section due to her size.
Her mother is not obese, but her father is overweight. Her mother tested
negative for diabetes during the pregnancy. Since birth, Sienna has had
an incredible appetite. Her mother could not breastfeed her because she
could not keep up with the baby’s demand for food. An average infant of
Sienna’s age will eat one quart of formula per day. Sienna consumed
two quarts per day. When Sienna was six months old, we told her
mother to start feeding her solid foods. Sienna eats constantly and will
scream if her mother does not feed her. She already has high cholesterol
and high blood pressure.
s Sienna obese because of her behavior? Was this learned behavior? When would she
have learned this behavior, and from whom? Has she, at age one, learned to control
her mother to get what she wants? Should she accept personal responsibility for her
actions?
Based on “a calorie is a calorie,” behaviors come first. Personal responsibility
implies a choice: that there is a conscious decision leading
to a behavior. This
behavior is formed because of learned benefits or detriments (e.g., a child placing her
hand on a stove and learning it is hot). But does this make sense with regard to obesity?
In everyone? In anyone? There are six reasons to doubt “personal responsibility” as the
cause of obesity.
1. Obesity Is Not a Choice
The concept of personal responsibility for obesity doesn’t always make sense. In our
society today, one has to ask: Are there people who see obesity as a personal
advantage? Something to be desired or emulated? Across the board, modern Western
societies today value the thin and shun the obese. Obesity frequently comes with many
medical complications, and those afflicted are more likely to develop heart problems
and type 2 diabetes (see
chapter 9
). Obese people spend twice as much on health care.

Studies show that the obese have more difficulty in dating, marriage, and fertility. The
obese tend to be poorer and, even in high-paying jobs, earn less than their peers.

Now ask the same question about children. Did Sienna see obesity as a personal
advantage? Did she become obese on purpose? Obese children have a quality of life
similar to that of children on cancer chemotherapy.

 They are ostracized by their peers
and are the targets of bullies. Many obese children suffer from low self-esteem, shame,
self-hatred, and loneliness. One study showed children pictures of potential playmates.
Each looked different and some had physical handicaps, such as being deformed or in a
wheelchair. The researchers asked the children with whom they would rather play. The
obese child came in dead last. Clearly, obesity is not something to which people,
especially children, aspire.
However, this view of obesity does not necessarily square with the beliefs of obese
people themselves. They see themselves as perpetrators, not victims. They often state
that they know their behavior is out of control and that this behavior is their own fault.
They frequently experience yo-yo dieting. They lose weight for a period of time, and
when they gain it back they blame themselves, seeing the gain as a character failing.
They
often recount binge eating, which suggests that a degree of dietary control is lost.
These experiences of losing control make them think they had the control in the first
place. Did they?
2. Diet and Exercise Don’t Work
If obesity were only about increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure,
then reducing intake (diet) and increasing expenditure (exercise) would be effective. If
obesity were caused by learned behaviors, then changing those behaviors would be
effective in reversing the process and promoting weight loss. Specific and notable
successes have led to behavior/lifestyle modification as the cornerstone of therapy for
obesity.
There are the anecdotal cases of weight loss by celebrities, such as Kirstie Alley or
Oprah Winfrey, who publicly endorse their diets as if they were the latest fashionable
handbags. They share their stories on TV and convince their viewers that this lifestyle
change is possible for them, too, and that, as with adding the newest fall color to their
wardrobe, losing weight will make them attractive and happy. There are reality
television shows, such as
The Biggest Loser
, that document the weight loss (along with
many a meltdown) of “normal people” through controlled diet and exercise. Publicity,
cash prizes, and constant attention are often enough to change one’s diet and exercise
response for a short time. In any magazine and many infomercials, peddlers of new
weight-loss remedies provide before and after pictures of people who have lost 100
pounds.
Whether this constitutes a true lasting change in behavior is doubtful. After all,
Kirstie Alley and Oprah, celebrities who live in the public eye, have gained their
weight back several times (until their newest miracle diet began, countless new diet
books were sold, new gurus were anointed, millions of dollars were made, and the
cycle repeated itself). There have been numerous reports of contestants on
The Biggest
Loser
 regaining much of their weight after the show ended. Most notably, Eric Chopin,
the Season 3 winner, appeared on
Oprah
 to tell his sorry tale of gaining at least half the
weight back after his victory. He wrote in one blog post, “I’m still not back on track
totally. I don’t know what it is.” Significant weight regain has been
seen in up to one
third of patients who have had surgery for weight loss (see
chapter 19
), because the
reason for the obesity is still there. Unless it’s dealt with directly, regaining will be the
norm, not the exception.
Strict control of one’s environment through limiting caloric intake and increasing
physical activity can result in weight loss. This is true as long as the environment
remains regulated. A perfect example is the army recruit who consistently loses weight
due to monitored diet and vigorous exercise. This also accounts for the number of “fat
schools” and “fat camps” that have sprung up nationwide. Parents send their
overweight child away for the summer and are thrilled when he returns thinner, if
harboring parental resentment. There are numerous reports of Hollywood stars who
bulk up for a role (remember Robert DeNiro in
Raging Bull
?) and then lose the excess
weight after shooting. (Of course, they have the benefit of round-the-clock personal
trainers and nutritionists to monitor their food intake.) While such results are dramatic,
they usually cannot be sustained.
Environmental control
 is different from
behavioral
control
 (see
chapters 17
 and

).
The real problem is not in losing the weight but in keeping it off for any meaningful
length of time. Numerous sources show that almost every lifestyle intervention works
for the first three to six months. But then the weight comes rolling back.

 The number of
people who can maintain any meaningful degree of weight loss is extremely small (see
figure 3.1
). However, because behavior/lifestyle modification is the accepted
treatment, the general explanation of weight regain is that it is the individual’s fault.
Because he is “choosing” not to live a healthy lifestyle, the doctors and the insurance
industry do not feel it their responsibility to intervene.
The same is true for children. Due to some notable and individual successes,
behavior/lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of therapy. However, this is not a
winning strategy for most obese children. Research shows that dietary interventions
don’t often work. Exercise interventions are even less successful. And unfortunately for
children like Sienna, at one year of age they are unable to run on a treadmill. Also, the
effects of altering lifestyle for obesity
prevention
 are underwhelming and show
minimal effect on behavior and essentially no effect on BMI.

3. The Obesity Epidemic Is Now a Pandemic
If obesity were just an American phenomenon it would be an epidemic, an outbreak of
illness specific to a certain area. One might then blame our American culture for
promoting it. Due to our slippage in education and technological superiority, we’re
labeled as “fat and lazy” or “gluttons and sloths.” Yet obesity is now a
pandemic
, a
worldwide problem.
The United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada are right behind us. Also, in the past
ten years, obese children have increased in France from 5 to 10 percent, in Japan from
6 to 12 percent, and in South Korea from 7 to 18 percent.

 In fact, obesity and chronic
metabolic diseases are occurring in underdeveloped countries that have never had such
problems before.

 Previously, poorer countries such as Malaysia had problems with
malnutrition. Now Malaysia has the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes on the planet.
China has an epidemic of childhood obesity, at 8 percent in urban areas. Brazil’s rate
of increase in obesity is predicted to reach that of the United States by 2020. Even
India, which continues to have an enormous problem with malnutrition, is not immune
—since 2004, the number of overweight children increased from 17 percent to 27
percent. Sienna is not a rarity; her obese peers are being born everywhere. The areas
experiencing the greatest rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes include Asia (especially
the Pacific Rim) and Africa, which are not wealthy areas.

 No corner of the globe is
spared.
This is not an American problem, an Australian problem, a British problem, or a
Japanese problem. This is a global problem. Could each of these countries be
experiencing the same cultural shifts toward gluttony and sloth that we are? Childhood
obesity knows no intellect, class, or continent.
What change in the last thirty years ties all the countries of the world together? As I
mentioned in the introduction, the “American diet” has morphed into the “industrial
global diet.” Despite people in other countries disapproving of our fast food and TV
culture, our diet has invaded virtually every other country. Our fast food culture is now
global due to taste, shelf life, cost, shipping ease, and the “cool” factor (a result of
effective marketing). Its acceptance is also a response to the contaminated water
supplies in these areas: soft drinks are often safer, cheaper, and more available than
potable water.

 They are also cheaper and certainly more available than milk.
4. Even Animals Raised in Captivity Are Getting Fat
A recent report documented that, in the past twenty years, animals raised in captivity
exhibit increasing body weights. The study examined the records of 22,000 animals of 8
different species, from rats to orangutans.

 These animals were housed in multiple
human-built colonies around the world, including labs and zoos. They don’t eat our
commercial food. However, their food is still processed and composed of the same
general ingredients as our own. Also, these animals drink the same water and breathe
the same air that we do. We don’t yet know why this is happening, but the fact that even
animals are showing signs of weight gain argues both against personal responsibility
and in favor of some sort of environmental insult to which all life on the planet is now
exposed (see
chapter 15
).
5. The Poor Pay More
As stated earlier, personal responsibility implies a choice, usually a conscious choice.
Can one exercise personal responsibility if one doesn’t have a choice? It is well known
that the poor have much higher rates of
obesity and chronic disease than do the rich.
There are many reasons for this difference, and it is difficult to pinpoint one factor that
is responsible. In the United States the poor exhibit two separate traits that argue
against personal responsibility.
First, there are possible genetic issues. It is well known that African Americans and
Latinos in the United States are more economically disadvantaged than their Caucasian
peers. These demographic groups have higher rates of obesity than Caucasians—40
percent of Latinos and 50 percent of African Americans are obese—and are more
likely to have associated medical problems, such as metabolic syndrome.

 Certain
genetic variations are more common in specific minority groups. These differences in
DNA may, in part, explain the higher rates of obesity and certain metabolic diseases,
such as fatty liver (see
chapters 7
 and

). Genetic makeup is certainly not a choice.
Second, there are issues of access. There is a difference between the “healthy” diet
of the affluent, who can purchase fresh, unprocessed foods that are high in fiber and
nutrients and low in sugar, but at high prices, and, the unhealthy diet of the poor, which
consists mainly of low-cost processed foods and drinks that do not need refrigeration
and maintain a long shelf life. But access does not refer only to what people can afford
to buy. Many poor neighborhoods throughout America lack farmers’ markets,
supermarkets, and grocery stores where “healthy” foods can be purchased.

 Many
supermarkets have pulled out of poor neighborhoods, mainly because of financial
decisions based on revenue and fear of crime. The national supermarket chain Kroger,
which is headquartered in Cincinati, in 2007 purchased twenty former Farmer Jack
stores in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan, but none within the Detroit city limits. The
nearest branch is in Dearborn, eight miles away from downtown. Many who live in
low-income areas also have limited access to transportation. Lower-class urban areas
throughout America have been labeled “food deserts” because they are unable to
sustain a healthy lifestyle. If the only place you can shop is a corner store for processed
food, is what you eat really a choice? In wealthier areas of San Francisco, nearly every
block has an organic food store, while in the city’s poorer areas, each corner is dotted
with a fast food franchise.
Even when all foods are available at low cost, the poor may not have
access to
refrigerators or even kitchens. Many SROs (single-room occupancy) hotels have only
hot plates and no space for keeping or cooking healthy meals. Further, there is the issue
of time. Many poor families are led by parents who work multiple jobs and are unable
to come home and prepare healthy meals for their children, instead relying on fast food
or pizza.
Lastly, the poor suffer from issues of food insecurity. People experience massive
amounts of stress when they don’t know where their next meal is coming from (see
chapter 6
). They eat what is available, when they can—usually processed food. That
level of stress is incompatible with the concept of choice. Stressed people can’t make a
rational choice, particularly one in which short-term objectives (e.g., sating their
hunger) are pitted against longer-term objectives (e.g., ensuring good health).
6. The Greatest Rate of Increase in Obesity
Is in the Youngest Patients
When you look at U.S. trends in childhood obesity over the past forty years, you see that
every age group is affected. However, the age group that shows the greatest rate of
increase in the last decade is the two- to five-year-olds.

 It is impossible to ascribe
personal responsibility or free choice to this age group. Toddlers don’t decide when,
what, or how much to eat. They do not shop for or cook their own food. However, as
all parents know, they do have lungs and they do make their preferences known in the
supermarket. Research has shown that children are not able to tell the difference
between a TV show and a commercial until they are eight years old. Children in the
United States watch an average of three to four hours of TV per day. The programs are
interspersed with commercials that target these young viewers and convince them of
what they need.

 If you can’t discern what’s marketing and what’s not, how can you
defend yourself against it?
We even have an epidemic of obese six-month-olds.

 They don’t diet or exercise.
They drink breast milk or formula and lie in their cribs. While our society easily puts
the blame on our current diet and exercise practices, how does this explain the obese
six-month-old? Whatever theory you have to explain the obesity epidemic, it has to
explain them also. The concept of
diet and exercise in an obese infant is a non sequitur.
Sienna and other obese six-month-olds lay waste to the idea of personal responsibility
for obesity. Instead of perpetrator, the obese six-month-old must be a victim. But a
victim of what? Or whom?
Who Is to Blame?
So we are left with a conundrum. We’re all eating more and exercising less. By 2050,
obesity will be the norm, not the exception. Do abnormal behaviors drive obesity? If
so, behavior is primary, behavior is a choice, and personal responsibility is front and
center. But what if it’s the other way around? What if our biological process of weight
gain drives these abnormal behaviors (see
chapter 4
)? To argue against personal
responsibility is to argue against free will. “Free will” is defined as “the power of
making free choices that are unconstrained by external circumstances or by necessity.”
Who is making the choices? Philosophers and scientists have argued this topic for
centuries. Albert Einstein stated, “If the moon, in the act of completing its eternal way
around the earth, were gifted with self-consciousness, it would feel thoroughly
convinced that it was traveling its way of its own accord…so would a Being, endowed
with higher insight and more perfect intelligence, watching man and his doings, smile
about man’s illusion that he was acting according to his own free will.” Anthony
Cashmore of the University of Pennsylvania recently proposed that free will was in
reality an interaction between our DNA and our environment, along with some
stochastic (random) processes.

 Because our DNA cannot be changed, and because
random processes are random, we’re left with our environment, both as the sentinel
exposure and the only factor than can be manipulated.
The debate about who or what is to blame for obesity will not be settled anytime
soon. But I would argue that ascribing personal responsibility to the obese individual is
not a rational argument for an eminently practical reason: it fails to advance any efforts
to change it. The obesity pandemic is due to our altered biochemistry, which is a result
of our altered environment.
Part 2
 will demonstrate how our behaviors are secondary,
and are molded by our biochemistry.

To Eat or Not to Eat?
That’s
Not
 the Question
Chapter 4
W
Gluttony and Sloth—Behaviors
Driven by Hormones
Marie is a sixteen-year-old girl with a brain tumor of the hypothalamus
(the area at the base of the brain that regulates the hormones of the
body). When she was ten, cranial radiation was required to kill the
tumor. Since then, she has gained 30 pounds per year; she weighed 220
pounds when I first saw her. Her insulin levels spiked to incredible
heights every time she ate. She had a form of intractable weight gain due
to brain damage called hypothalamic obesity. She wouldn’t do any
activity at home, couldn’t study in school, and was severely depressed.
As part of a research study, I started her on a drug called octreotide,
which lowered her insulin release. Within one week Marie’s mother
called me to say, “Dr. Lustig, something’s happening. Before, we would
go to Taco Bell where she would eat five tacos and an encharito and
still be hungry. Now we go, she has two tacos and she’s full. And she’s
starting to help me around the house.” After beginning the medication,
Marie commented to me, “This is the first time my head hasn’t been in
the clouds since the tumor.” Within a year, she was off antidepressants
and had lost 48 pounds.
ho’s at fault here? Is this a case of free will? And what happened to cause Marie’s
reversal? If obesity is truly a result of too much energy intake (gluttony) and too
little energy burned (sloth), then my last sixteen years taking care of obese children has
been a complete and utter waste.
Because it’s become painfully evident, after years of
motivating, pleading, and arguing, that I can’t change children’s behavior. And I
certainly can’t change their parents’ behavior. It was this insight from Marie, and other
children like her, that exposed the inherent problems in our current thinking.
Biochemistry and hormones drive our behavior.
The idea that biochemistry comes first is not a new one, but it is one that physicians,
scientists, and the public should embrace. Think about the following: You see a patient
who drinks ten gallons of water a day and urinates ten gallons of water a day (highly
abnormal). What is wrong with him? Could he have a behavioral disorder and be a
psychogenic water-drinker? Could be. Much more likely he has diabetes insipidus, a
defect in a water-retaining hormone at the level of the kidney. You see a twenty-five-
year-old who falls asleep in his soup. Was he up partying all night? Perhaps. But he
may have narcolepsy, which is a defect in the hormone that stimulates arousal (orexins)
in the midbrain. The biochemistry drives the behavior. Schizophrenia for one hundred
years was a mental health disorder. Now we know that it’s a defect in dopamine
neurotransmission and that no amount of psychotherapy is going to help until you treat
the biochemical defect. Thus, we routinely infer “biochemical” defects in many
“behavioral” disturbances.
Introducing Energy Processing and Storage
To appreciate how hormones control eating behavior, first we have to look at what
happens to the food we eat. In response to various brain signals (hunger, reward,
stress) we ingest various calorie-laden foodstuffs (combinations of fat, protein,
carbohydrate, and fiber, with some micronutrients thrown in for good measure) to build
muscle and bone for growth and/or to burn for energy. These calories arrive at the
stomach, a muscular bag in the abdomen about the size of a baseball glove, which
releases hydrochloric acid, to begin to digest the food into smaller components. The
food makes its way into the next part of the digestive tract, called the small intestine.
There, a bunch of enzymes (proteins) digest the food into even smaller components,
such that dietary fats are digested into fatty acids,
dietary protein is sliced into amino
acids, and carbohydrate is cleaved into simple sugars (mostly glucose, with varying
amounts of the sweet molecule fructose). But we can’t digest dietary fiber, so it remains
intact. The fiber speeds the rate of transit of the food through the small intestine (see
chapter 12
), while limiting the rate of absorption of the other nutrients.
Once absorbed in the small intestine, the amino acids and simple sugars travel via
the portal vein to the liver for immediate processing. The fatty acids are transported to
the liver by a different route (the lymphatic system). The liver has first dibs on the
processing of each of these three classes of nutrient. Whatever the liver can’t take up
appears in the general circulation. Rising levels of glucose or amino acids or fatty
acids reach the pancreas, where the beta-cells release the hormone insulin.
Insulin, in common parlance, is known as the diabetes hormone. Diabetics inject
insulin to lower their blood glucose. But where does the glucose go? To the fat.
Insulin’s actual job is to be your
energy storage hormone
. When you eat something
(usually containing some form of carbohydrate), your blood glucose rises, signaling the
pancreas to release insulin commensurate with the rise in blood glucose. (This is the
theory behind the concept of
glycemic index
, which is discussed in
chapter 17
.) Insulin
then tops off the liver’s energy reserve by making liver starch (called glycogen), and
shunts any amino acids from the blood into muscle cells. Excess fatty acids, or blood
lipids, are cleared into fat cells for storage for a “rainy day,” where they get turned into
greasy triglycerides (such as the fat surrounding your steak). There is no energy storage
without insulin—it is the key that unlocks the door to the fat cell to let energy enter and
subsequently be stored as fat. Insulin makes fat—the more insulin, the more fat. And
there it sits…and sits…as long as there is insulin around. When the insulin levels drop,
the process goes in reverse: the triglycerides get broken down, causing the fat cells to
shrink—when it happens, that’s weight loss!—and the fatty acids reenter the
bloodstream and travel back to the liver, where they are burned by the liver or other
organs. In this way, by cycling our insulin up and down, we burn what we need, and
store the rest.
Introducing the Hypothalamus
For the past sixty years we’ve known that the brain, especially the one cubic centimeter
at the base of the brain called the hypothalamus, controls this process of energy
balance. It’s about the size of a thumbnail, and it is “ground zero” for the control of
almost all the hormonal systems in the body.
Imagine the organization of a taxicab company. At the bottom are the taxicab
drivers, getting their orders from a central dispatcher by radio and shuttling passengers
all over town. The target organs—the thyroid, the adrenal, the testicles, the ovaries—
are like the cabbies. They receive their orders from the central dispatcher, or, in this
case, the pituitary or “master gland,” which acts as the main control system. The
hormones released are similar to the taxi’s computerized system, signaling to the
pituitary to tell it how things are going out in the field. Like the central dispatcher who
directs the cabs based on their location, the pituitary will then adjust its message.
However, there is another layer of control: the chief executive officer, or CEO,
who decides on hiring and firing, contracts, upgrades, and mergers and acquisitions.
The company can’t turn a profit without the cabbies, be efficient without the dispatcher,
or be sustainable long term without a CEO. Furthermore, the CEO can alter the
direction of the company based on the profitability of its cabdrivers. The CEO is akin
to the hypothalamus. It sends blood-borne hormonal signals to tell the pituitary what to
do. It then makes large-scale decisions based on the function of the peripheral glands,
which send it information via the bloodstream. And it integrates information from other
areas of the brain to alter the long-term hormonal milieu. Marie’s hypothalamus was
damaged beyond repair, which caused it to be ineffective in controlling her hormones
and, therefore, her behavior.
The Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH) and Energy
Balance
The hierarchy of energy balance is even more complicated. A subarea of this thumbnail
is called the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which serves the executive function of
controlling energy storage versus expenditure. Because energy balance is
so
 important
to survival, there are redundant systems in case one goes amiss to ensure that the
organism doesn’t die.
It’s clear that energy balance is the most complex function we
humans perform. It’s likewise apparent that energy storage, or the creation of fat cells,
is the default strategy. Bottom line, we humans won’t give up our hard-earned energy
without a fight.
There are afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) systems that control energy
balance

 (see
figure 4.1
). The VMH receives acute meal-to-meal information from the
GI (gastro-intestinal) tract on both hunger and satiety (not shown in the figure). Either
one can turn the feeling of hunger on or off by itself. But that’s not all. In addition, the
VMH receives more long-term information on one’s fat stores and nutrient metabolism:
in other words, whether your body needs to consume more calories for longer-term
survival. This information is conveyed via the hormones leptin and insulin
to the
hypothalamus, where it is decoded and either stimulates or suppresses appetite, and
adjusts energy expenditure accordingly.
Fig. 4.1. How the Brain and Hormones Work Together (or Don’t) to Regulate Energy Balance.
 The
hypothalamus receives hormonal information from the fat cells (leptin). This information is processed into one of two
signals: (a) anorexigenesis (
I’m not hungry and I can burn energy
) or (b) orexigenesis (
I’m hungry and I want to
store energy
). Anorexigenesis turns
on
 the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for muscle activity and fat loss),
and turns
off
 the vagus nerve (responsible for appetite and fat gain); while orexigenesis does the opposite. However,
high insulin blocks the leptin signal, mimicking “brain starvation” and driving orexigenesis, so that we feel hungry even
when we have eaten.
From there, the hypothalamus sends signals from the brain to the body via two
components of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is that
portion of your body that controls your heart rate, blood pressure, and energy
metabolism without your conscious effort. It is composed of two parts: the sympathetic
nervous system (responsible for the fight-or-flight response) and the parasympathetic
nervous system (responsible for “vegetative” functions such as food absorption and
energy storage). The vagus nerve is one of the key components of the parasympathetic
nervous system. There is a delicate balance and feedback loop between the sympathetic
and parasympathetic systems. When that balance changes, that’s when problems ensue.
The vagus nerve is fascinating. It connects the brain to all the digestive organs in the
abdomen: the liver, the intestine, the pancreas, and also to the fat cells. It performs
many different functions but with one ultimate goal: to store energy. The vagus is your
energy storage nerve. The vagus has two parts: the afferent part (organs to brain), and
the efferent part (brain to organs). The afferent vagus communicates the sensation of
hunger between the stomach and brain, and also communicates information on energy
processing during a meal between the liver and brain. The VMH interprets all these
afferent signals, which leads to one of two physiologic states: anorexigenesis (
I don’t
need any more food, I can burn energy as needed, and I feel good
) or orexigenesis (
I
don’t have enough food, I don’t want to burn any energy, and I will feel lousy until I
get some more
).
The anorexigenesis signal turns on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which
promotes energy expenditure by telling the adipose (fat) tissue and the muscles to burn
energy, thereby resulting in weight loss and a sense of well-being. Anorexigenesis also
turns off the vagus nerve and, in so doing, reduces appetite. Conversely, orexigenesis
stimulates the vagus nerve to promote energy storage by increasing appetite. It
accomplishes this by sending multiple signals through the vagus nerve: to the
gastrointestinal tract to digest and absorb the food; to the adipose tissue to store more
energy (make more fat); and to the pancreas to increase the amount of insulin released
(promoting more energy storage into adipose tissue).
Leptin and the Elusive “Holy Grail” of Obesity
When the hormone leptin (from the Greek
Leptos
, for “thin”) was discovered in 1994,
for the first time, scientists thought that obesity might have a biochemical basis. Leptin
has been a veritable godsend to scientists who study obesity. It provided the starting
point to understanding the biochemistry of the brain pathways that control food intake
and the impetus for scientists and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to believe that
there was a simple way out of this mess, one that could be easily treated with medicine
and science. The U.S. government began, and continues today, to shovel money at
obesity research, hoping for a treatment that works. Conversely, leptin has been the
biggest disappointment to those who suffer from obesity. And woe to the
pharmaceutical industry, which hoped to harness its potential for a cure and generate
megabucks in the process. The pharmaceutical company Amgen was so enamored of
leptin’s blockbuster marketing potential that it offered $30 million for the exclusive
marketing rights to the hormone, even before a human experiment had been performed.
Amgen has since become so disillusioned that it has farmed leptin out to another
company, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, to see if it will have better luck.
Leptin is a protein made and released by fat cells. It circulates in the bloodstream,
goes to the hypothalamus, and signals the hypothalamus that you’ve got enough energy
stored up in your fat.

 The discovery of leptin closed the loop, providing a
servomechanism (like your home’s thermostat) in which the body’s fat cells told the
hypothalamus whether the animal was in energy surplus (obesity) or dearth (starvation).
Obese animals and humans deficient in leptin respond immediately to leptin treatment
with remarkable losses of fat and also with increased activity.

 Leptin replacement
corrected both behaviors, the gluttony and the sloth. The thought was, if you’re obese,
then your leptin doesn’t work—you must be deficient and you just need more. Problem
solved, right? Unfortunately, for the obese population, this simple-minded explanation
was just that.
Defective Leptin Signaling: Brain Starvation
The VMH is constantly looking for the leptin signal. In the short-term, hormonal inputs
can govern the size or the quality of this meal or that, but long term it’s all about leptin.
Leptin tells the VMH that you have enough energy on board to burn the excess, feel
good, reduce your long-term food intake, and remain weight stable. When your leptin
signal works, you’re in energy balance, burning energy at a normal rate and feeling
good.

 Every human has a “personal leptin threshold” above which the brain interprets
a state of energy sufficiency. Thus, the leptin-replete state is characterized by
appropriate appetite, normal physical activity, and feelings of well-being. Woe to the
97-pound weakling who can’t bulk up and gain weight; his leptin threshold is set too
low, and his leptin is telling his brain to burn off any excess.
But what if leptin doesn’t work or the threshold is set too high? When the VMH
can’t see the leptin signal, the brain interprets this as “starvation” and will direct the
rest of the body to do whatever it can to increase its energy stores. The VMH relays
messages to the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) to conserve energy and reduce
activity. Energy expenditure is reduced by 20 percent, a great reason to feel like a
sloth.

 Furthermore, the VMH wants the body to increase energy storage. It will
increase the firing of the vagus nerve in order to amplify insulin release from the
pancreas and shunt more energy into fat cells, with the ultimate goal of making more
leptin. The vagus makes you hungry in order that you store more energy (gluttony).
Simply put, defective leptin signaling in the VMH is what brain starvation is all about.
This phenomenon occurs in two ways:
Leptin deficiency.
 Dr. Jeff Friedman of Rockefeller University is credited with
cloning the leptin gene from leptin-deficient mice,

 which are the rodent equivalents of
a 400-pound couch potato. While normal weight at birth, these mice immediately eat
like there’s no tomorrow and just sit there—the only time they ever get off their behinds
is if you put food on the other side of the cage; then they’ll waddle over to it, devour it,
and sit there instead. These mice are deficient in leptin due to a genetic mutation. Their
behaviors of gluttony and sloth are genetically determined. Their brain can’t see their
fat and in turn thinks the body is starving.
Friedman’s lab also showed that giving these mice back the leptin they were
missing by daily injection reduced their food intake and increased their physical
activity back to normal. They lost the weight. Not only that, but all the physiological
problems associated with their obesity—the diabetes, the lipid problems, and early
death from heart disease—all disappeared. This made leptin look for all intents and
purposes like the “holy grail” of obesity. If leptin deficiency was the cause of this
pandemic, we could simply replace it, and all the unfortunate souls afflicted could be
saved.
Thus far, fourteen children with mutations of the leptin gene have been identified in
the entire world. These children cannot make leptin no matter how big their fat cells
are, and their brains are in constant starvation mode. Amazingly, with a shot of leptin
every day, they lose weight rapidly, and it’s all fat (no muscle). They stop their
ravenous behavior, start moving, and their puberty goes into gear.

 For these patients,
leptin is hormone-replacement therapy; while not a cure, it’s the next best thing.
Leptin resistance
. This is the key to the obesity epidemic. With a few rare
exceptions, the other 1.5 billion overweight or obese people on the planet suffer from
this. Deciphering leptin resistance is the “holy grail” of obesity. These people have
plenty of leptin, and each one’s blood leptin level correlates with his or her amount of
body fat. This suggests that obese people are not leptin deficient but rather
leptin
resistant
.

 Their hypothalami can’t see their leptin, so their brains think they’re
starving, and will therefore try to increase energy storage (gluttony) and conserve
energy usage (sloth).
In 1999, Steven Heymsfield, then at Columbia University, gave daily injections of
leptin at varying doses to obese adults for six months. All these people had high leptin
levels to start. The degree of weight loss, even with the highest dosage of leptin, was
underwhelming.

 Clearly these obese people were leptin resistant. They couldn’t
respond to their own leptin, and no amount of extra leptin was going to make a
difference. Heymsfield’s study was the end of the promise of leptin as a stand-alone
therapy for obesity and the end of Amgen’s interest.
Hypothalamic Obesity: Behavior or Biochemistry?
This is where I enter the story. In 1995, I arrived in Memphis to start work at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital as a pediatric neuroendocrinologist. My training is in
taking care of kids with brain tumors, and St. Jude had a large population of survivors,
Many of these children develop hormonal deficiencies because of damage to the
hypothalamus—due to the tumor itself, the neurosurgery to remove it, or the radiation
and chemotherapy they receive to try to kill it. The good news is that we
endocrinologists can treat these children by replacing most of the hormones that are
missing—we can affect their growth, energy metabolism, and cognitive status; induce
puberty when the children are age appropriate; and improve their overall health.
However, a relatively small number of children like Marie (and adults) who
survive their brain tumors become
massively
 obese after their tumor therapy is
complete. Their hypothalamus is damaged, and their weight skyrockets. Their appetites
aren’t that different from those of other obese children, but their energy expenditure is
markedly decreased. (Marie didn’t move.) Those affected sit on the couch, watch TV,
eat, poop, sleep, and generally lose interest in the world around them. As one parent
stated, “It’s double jeopardy. To think you might lose your kid to a cancer, and survive
it, but then to lose your kid to a complication instead.” Patients with this form of
obesity, called hypothalamic obesity, can’t lose weight. Even if these kids eat only 500
calories a day, they gain weight.

 The neurons in the hypothalamus, which sense the
leptin signal, are all dead. The “servo-mechanism” for energy balance had been short-
circuited. This is leptin resistance at its worst—an
anatomic
 leptin resistance. Rodent
studies dating back to the early 1950s show that when you damage the VMH, the animal
will become massively obese, and not even food restriction will reverse that. The
VMH-lesioned rats ate more than they needed and burned less than they should have.
Unlike the leptin-deficient mice, no amount of leptin would fix the problem. These
animals had
anatomic
 leptin resistance.

 The leptin had no place to act.
The obese children I saw at St. Jude were similar to these VMH-lesioned rats.
There was no fixing them because there was no way to
regrow those neurons. Those
kids were stuck forever in bodies that just kept storing energy instead of burning it,

with brains that constantly thought the bodies were starving. They would forever get
fatter on fewer calories, never feel good, and would lose interest in everything around
them. If this isn’t hell on earth for parent and child, I don’t know what is.
Worst yet, there was no treatment. Diet and exercise is notoriously ineffective in
these children. Weight loss drugs also didn’t work. In 1995, I was faced with a clinic
full of patients with hypothalamic obesity following their brain tumor therapy. How to
help them? I couldn’t give them leptin, because the block at the hypothalamus would not
allow leptin to work. If any therapy were to be successful, it would have to work
downstream of the leptin neuron, somewhere between the brain and the fat cell.
Insulin: The “Leptinator”
Normally, the amount of insulin released in response to a meal is yoked to the blood
sugar rise. But there are a few things that force the pancreas to make extra insulin, the
vagus nerve being chief among them. When the brain can’t see the leptin signal, as in
children such as Marie, it interprets starvation. The vagus nerve goes into overdrive to
store more energy, and kick-starts the pancreas to make extra insulin—even more than
the glucose rise would predict. This excess insulin release drives nonstop energy
storage and nonstop weight gain.
As it happens, there is a drug available that can lower insulin secretion as a side-
effect. It is called octreotide (Sandostatin, made by Novartis Pharmaceuticals) and is
what we used to treat Marie. It is normally used to reduce pituitary growth hormone
secretion in patients who have tumors of the pituitary gland, a disease called
acromegaly. But it also happens to reduce pancreatic insulin secretion. It doesn’t wipe
it out completely—that would cause diabetes—but it does reduce the rapid early
release of insulin in response to a meal or a glucose tolerance test. But it’s expensive,
requires injections, has side-effects, and with regard to obesity, it is for experimental
studies only.
We have treated many children with hypothalamic obesity
with octreotide.

 When
we were successful in reducing their insulin release, the patients lost weight and started
to feel better. Parents were calling me up within the first few weeks, saying, “I’ve got
my kid back!” Most amazingly, the children had started to be active. When we got the
insulin down, Marie and patients like her improved physically, mentally, and socially.
These studies highlight a crucial concept of obesity. Each of us is really two
compartments: lean body mass (heart, liver, kidneys, brain, and muscles), which burns
energy; and fat, which stores energy. Every molecule of energy consumed has a choice:
to which compartment does the energy go? Is the energy burned or stored? Your
consumption of energy is never high enough to overwhelm both compartments at the
same time; no one can eat that much. This means that there is an issue of energy flux to
the two compartments. What factor determines which compartment gets the energy?
Your insulin does. The more insulin there is, the more energy goes to fat. Normally
your fat makes more leptin, which would feedback on your hypothalamus and decrease
your insulin by reducing appetite and limiting your energy intake. In this way, the
“servo-mechanism” between leptin, the brain, your pancreas, your insulin, and your fat
cells maintains normal energy balance.
But
…if your hypothalamus can’t see your leptin
(in this case, because those neurons are dead from a brain tumor), then your brain thinks
it’s starving. It will reduce your activity to conserve energy, and increase your appetite
to store more energy. When leptin doesn’t work, the biochemistry comes first and the
behaviors of gluttony and sloth are secondary.
This is all well and good for Marie and the few unfortunate souls with
hypothalamic obesity. They have a brain tumor. They have a legitimate excuse for being
fat, and at least there is now a rational, if painful and expensive, approach to treatment.
For them, the biochemistry dictates the behavior. However, the overwhelming majority
of obese people do not have a goombah sitting in the middle of their heads wreaking
havoc on their energy balance pathway. What does this phenomenon have to do with the
obesity pandemic? As you will see, everything.
Back in 1998, after three years of my working at St. Jude, the response of these
patients was quite a revelation. My colleagues at the University of Tennessee and I
wondered, “Is it possible that an adult population without brain tumors might manifest
the same problem? Did they also have
increased vagal tone driving excess insulin
secretion and causing their obesity? If we gave them octreotide to suppress their
insulin, might they lose weight, feel better, and start exercising?” We didn’t know what
these patients looked like. So we did a pilot study in forty-four morbidly obese adults
recruited from off the street. We treated all of them with octreotide for six months,
courtesy of Novartis Pharmaceuticals. No dieting, no exercise, just the drug. We told
them, “If the drug works, it will work by itself.”
We’ve done this experiment twice, first as a pilot and then as a placebo-controlled
trial. The majority of patients did not respond to the drug. But in about 20 percent of the
adults, there was big-time weight loss. The thing that predicted their success was their
insulin status. The lucky responders released insulin rapidly and in high amounts at
baseline, just like the brain tumor kids,

 and their quality of life improved with the
drug.
There is one final lesson to glean from these studies. All these obese adult subjects
had high leptin levels. They were leptin resistant; if their leptin worked right, they
wouldn’t have been obese. If leptin falls, the brain should interpret this as starvation
and reduce the patient’s resting energy expenditure accordingly. But these patients’
resting energy expenditures went up! And their improvement in energy expenditure
correlated with the suppression of their insulin levels, the same as with the brain tumor
kids. When we were successful in getting their insulin down, their leptin resistance
improved.

 This suggests that insulin can block leptin signaling in the brain, and
therefore insulin acts as a “leptin antagonist.”

Many scientists have now shown that insulin actions in the VMH block leptin
signaling.

 A reduction in insulin concentrations results in a decline in leptin. Insulin
and leptin are independent hormones that bind to separate receptors in the VMH. They
have their own separate pathways of action, but they share the same signaling cascade.
When insulin levels at the VMH are chronically high, leptin cannot signal the
hypothalamus.
Deconstructing Darwin
Whenever paradoxical events occur in biology, one has to look for an evolutionary
explanation. Why should insulin block leptin signaling? What’s
the advantage for
insulin, the hormone that tells the body to store energy, to block leptin, the hormone that
tells your brain to burn energy? Leptin is a necessary signal to the VMH for the
initiation of high-energy processes, such as puberty and pregnancy. If leptin always
worked right, then nobody could gain weight. Think of the 97-pound weakling at the
beach. The crucial weight gain during puberty and pregnancy would be compromised,
and our reproductive capacity would be shot. Twice in our lives we need to stop leptin
from working, or we can’t gain the weight, and the species dies out. Since insulin
drives energy storage, it makes sense that it should do double-duty, and also be the
central blocker of leptin—one hormone, two coordinated actions. Indeed, both puberty
and pregnancy are hyperinsulinemic states. When adulthood or the postpartum state is
reached, the insulin levels fall, weight stabilizes or is lost, and leptin levels return
toward baseline.

 However, in maladaptive conditions, when insulin is high all the
time and leptin signaling is impaired, the energy gets stored yet the brain sees
starvation, and obesity worsens.
When you examine the symptoms of obese and starved individuals, they are very
similar. On first thought this sounds ludicrous, but it actually makes sense. Both claim
fatigue, malaise, and depression. The reason for this in both groups is the inability to
adequately respond to the leptin signal—in starvation because of the inadequacy of
leptin, and in obesity because of the resistance to leptin. Furthermore, leptin
concentrations drop precipitously during periods of short-term fasting (within twelve
hours), declining faster than body fat stores. You haven’t lost any weight in that time,
but your fat cells are already telling your brain you’re starving, driving your food intake
back up. By the time you’re one day into any weight-loss regimen you’re already leptin
deficient on top of being leptin resistant, meaning, you
really
 can’t see the signal.
Trying not to eat for a day to fit into that little black dress? Oops. This actually drives
gluttony and sloth to return your weight to its baseline level. In a nutshell, this is the
recidivism of obesity. If your brain thinks there’s no leptin (due to either leptin
deficiency or leptin resistance) you’re pretty miserable. Your sympathetic nervous
system goes into conservation mode, driving down your energy expenditure, physical
activity, and quality of life. Your vagus nerve then goes into overdrive, driving up your
appetite, your insulin, and your energy storage.
The Alternate Interpretation of the First Law
No matter the mechanism, insulin blocks leptin signaling both in rodents and in humans.
In the body, insulin causes energy storage in fat cells. In the brain, insulin causes leptin
resistance and “brain starvation.” Insulin delivers a one-two punch to drive gluttony
and sloth, weight gain, and obesity the world over. Insulin is the bad guy in this story.
This idea turns obesity on its head. The standard thinking in obesity is: “If you eat
it, you had better burn it, or you’re going to store it”—in which case the weight gain is
secondary to the two behaviors of increased energy intake (gluttony) and decreased
energy expenditure (sloth). What these data are telling us is that it is the other way
around. Storing energy is a biochemical process not under the patient’s control. Burning
energy is synonymous with quality of life. Things that make you burn energy faster—
such as exercise, ephedrine (off the market now), and caffeine (for about two hours)—
make you feel good. Conditions that make you burn energy slower—starvation and
hypothyroidism, for example—make you feel lousy. So, the first law needs to be
reinterpreted: “If you are going to store it, and you expect to burn it, then you will have
to eat it.”

 In this interpretation, the biochemical process is primary, the weight gain is
secondary, and the behaviors are a result of the biochemistry.
Obesity is a biochemical alteration in the brain promoting leptin resistance with
resultant weight gain and secondary changes in behavior to maintain energy balance.
The apparent character defects of gluttony and sloth are not the cause of the problem;
they are the
result
 of the problem. The biochemistry drives the behavior, not vice
versa. The linchpin in this biochemical alteration is the hormone insulin. The majority
of humans, regardless of weight, release double the insulin today that we did thirty
years ago for the same amount of glucose. Now we’re left with the $147 billion (the
annual financial cost of obesity) question: If insulin is the bad guy and we’re all
hyperinsulinemic as never before in the history of humankind, where did the excess
insulin come from? And how do we reverse it?
The plot thickens.

Chapter 5
L
Food Addiction—Fact or Fallacy
Salvador is a fifteen-year-old Latino boy with obesity, a fatty liver, and
high blood pressure. He drinks four sodas a day. His mother does not
buy them for him or keep them in the house. Rather, he buys them at the
convenience store on the way to and from school. Salvador enrolls in
our research study whereby each day, for ten days, he will consume the
same number of calories from our hospital’s Metabolic Kitchen, which
will provide all his food, prepared by a chef and sugar free.
Nonetheless, each day, he buys a can of soda and brings it home, putting
it on his dresser, next to those from the day before. He tells his mother,
“When the study is over, I’m drinking them all.” Indeed, the evening of
the end of the study, he drinks every last one, to his mother’s chagrin. He
may not have been addicted physically, but the mental obsession and
craving indicated dependence, and could not be suppressed.
ife’s too short to eat bad food, even if it’s cheap. Eating is supposed to be an
enjoyable experience, especially when the food is special. There’s nothing quite like
going to a nice restaurant with the sights, sounds, and smells of a well-prepared meal.
It’s one of the true enjoyments of life. Yet familiarity breeds greater cravings. Ask
Philadelphians about their cheesesteaks, New Orleans denizens about their Po-Boys
and beignets, or Memphians about their barbecue. Surprise! Those are among the three
most obese cities in the country. Coincidence?
As prodigious as some American cuisine is, is there really anything special about a
soda, a French fry, or any item in a fast food restaurant? Yet we devour fast food as if it
were going out of style. Americans consume Big Macs as if each one might be our last.
(Given the mortality rates in the obese, each one just might be.) Fast food comprises a
growing portion of food eaten outside the home. In the United States of the 1950s, fast
food accounted for 4 percent of total sales of food outside the home. In 1997 it
accounted for 34 percent. Each day, 30 percent of U.S. adults eat at a fast food outlet,
and McDonald’s feeds forty-six million Americans.
What about the rest of the world? They didn’t experience fast food growing up, yet
it’s now the biggest seller in developing countries. There is no familiarity here; they
weren’t raised on the stuff; they’re consuming it
de novo
. Why do they eat fast food
when it’s not their traditional fare? Because it’s cheap? It certainly isn’t abroad. Why
do the locals frequent Taco Bell in Mexico when the original tacos are cheaper and
ostensibly healthier? Something more is going on here. Is the world addicted to fast
food? The biology of addiction is at the center of this question.
Might as Well Face It, We’re Addicted to…
Our brains are wired for reward—it is the primary force behind human survival.
Reward is the reason to get up in the morning. If you take away reward, you take away
the reason to live. We know this from recent experience with the anti-obesity drug
rimonabant, which was deep-sixed after it failed to gain approval from the FDA in
2007. Rimonabant is an endocannabinoid antagonist, or the “anti-marijuana” medicine
—which means it’s also “anti-munchies.” It inhibits the sense of reward. While it
worked to promote weight loss, 20 percent of the subjects who used it experienced
serious psychiatric side effects, especially depression, and there were several suicides.
Kill the reward system, and you just might want to kill yourself.
Although the brain’s reward system is complex and has many inputs, it can be
reduced to the “hedonic pathway.” This pathway is where primal emotions,
reproductive drive, and the survival instinct are all housed and expressed. These
reward mechanisms are thought to have evolved to reinforce behaviors that are
essential for perpetuation of the species and survival: such as sex for reproduction and
the enjoyment of food so that you eat. This is also the pathway that reinforces the
positive and negative aspects of drugs of abuse such as nicotine, cocaine, morphine,
and alcohol. In order to maintain eating as one of the most powerful urges in animal and
human behavior, evolution has also made it a rich source of pleasure and reward.
The hedonic pathway comprises a neural conduit between two brain areas: the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NA, also known as the
reward center), both of which are deep-brain structures. Pleasure occurs when the VTA
signals the NA to release dopamine, a neurotransmitter. It’s a signal from one brain
center to another. When the released dopamine binds to its specific dopamine D

receptor in the NA, the sense of pleasure is experienced.

So what are neurotransmitters and receptors? Think of keys and locks. Each neuron
is a cell body, and at its end is an axon (special fiber of the neuron that sends
information). This axon has a synapse, or pathway, that connects to the dendrites
(specialized fibers of the nerve cell that receive information) of the next neuron. When
a neural impulse is generated in the first cell, it pulses down to the end of the axon,
which contains little packets of neurotransmitters that are then released. These are the
keys. They travel across the synapse to the receptors (locks), located in the dendrites of
the next cell. There are many keys that take the path along the synapse, and not all of
them make it to their destination. Along their way via the synapse, some are
metabolized and some are “re-uptaken.” Dopamine is one of these types of keys
traveling to fit into the locks of the D

 receptors in the next cell, thus determining the
triggering and firing of the next cells down the chain.
Food intake is just one readout of the hedonic pathway.

 It appears to mediate
feeding on the basis of palatability rather than energy need:
I’m stuffed, but that
chocolate cake looks so good.
 When functional, the hedonic
pathway helps to curtail
food intake in situations where energy stores are replete:
I don’t need to finish that
macaroni and cheese.
 However, when dysfunctional, this pathway can increase food
intake, leading to obesity.
If you feed a rodent a palatable food (e.g., a high-fat, high-sugar food such as
cookie dough), the animal experiences reward because dopamine is released from the
VTA and binds to the D

 receptor in the NA. As long as that continues, the animal will
continue to eat and experience reward. There are three processes that modulate this
system in one direction or another:
1.   Anything that increases the dopamine transmission to the NA increases the
feeling of reward.
2.   Anything that clears dopamine from the NA will extinguish the feeling of
reward.
3.   Anything that reduces the number of D

 receptors in the NA, or binding of
dopamine to those receptors (such as chronic overuse of a substance), will
shortchange reward. You then need more dopamine, and hence more of the
substance, to get the same feeling of pleasure.
These precepts are as true for food as they are for addictive drugs. And food and
drugs cross over. With time we can become sensitized to a substance and need more of
it to get the same effect. Once sensitized, animals and humans may become
hyperresponsive to a new substance; this is known as cross-sensitization. In other
words, if the brain has been wired for addiction, it’s easy to switch from one substance
to another. Ask recovering alcoholics about their incessant need for coffee, tobacco,
and/or sugar. A reinforcer is a stimulus that increases the probability that an animal or
human will respond to the addictive drug. Food is a form of positive reinforcement.
Dopamine stimulation in the NA reinforces the intake of drugs or alcohol and also of
food.
The reinforcing effect of dopamine is attributed to D

 receptor stimulation. As
stated before, food intake increases as a result of morphine and marijuana use. The film
Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle
 details the odyssey of two very stoned guys
who seek to overcome seemingly
insurmountable obstacles in their quest for a
hamburger. We can measure this by dopamine release and D

 receptor signaling. Why
does dopamine matter so much? In a normal person, dopamine will be cleared from the
D

 receptors after he is satiated. If you have a decreased dopamine binding capacity,
there is a perceived need for compulsive food intake to provide excess stimulation of
these depressed circuits, thereby driving continued weight gain.
The Usual Suspects: Leptin and Insulin
Yup, them again. Not only are they central in the starvation response, but they are also
key players in this hedonic pathway, modulating reward in response to meals. In normal
circumstances, after you’ve eaten a sufficient amount, leptin sends a signal to the VTA
to suppress the release of dopamine, thereby reducing the reward of food.

So leptin extinguishes reward. But what if you are leptin resistant? That’s what
obesity is: leptin resistance. If leptin can’t act, then the dopamine isn’t cleared from the
NA, and the impetus for further consumption persists. If you’re leptin resistant, do you
really think you have the willpower to ignore both the starvation signal
and
 the reward
signal, when every food outlet you pass by provides you with sight or smell cues to
chow down? Starvation and reward conspire to thwart every obese person.
What about insulin, leptin’s accomplice? Normally, people are sufficiently
sensitive to insulin. Insulin’s job is to clear dopamine from the synapses (that pathway
between the cells) in the NA.

 Thus, the rise in insulin that occurs during a meal blunts
the reward of further food intake (
I’ve eaten enough—I really don’t need a second
helping
). This acts as a servomechanism built into the hedonic pathway to prevent
overfeeding. But what happens when you are insulin resistant? Insulin resistance leads
to leptin resistance in the VTA, contributing to increased caloric intake by preventing
dopamine clearance from the NA. Increased pleasure is then derived from food when
energy stores are full.

 Insulin and leptin resistance
lead not only to increased food
intake but to increased
palatable
 food intake or anything that is high in both fat and
sugar: the muffins, the Cinnabons, the cookies, the cheesecake. Is it any wonder Mrs.
Fields is in every shopping mall?
Defining Food Addiction: Liking, Wanting, and Needing
Look, we all like fast food. And why wouldn’t we? It’s designed to contain the greatest
concentration of fat, sugar, salt, and caffeine, and is placed into as small a package as
possible. Yummmm. It provides food cheaply, quickly, and without table service. The
pretty packaging and restaurant environment increase its salience (the properties that
make you like it more). Ten years ago, fast food locations in the United States generated
more than $125 billion, which accounts for 15 percent of sales of the
entire
 U.S. food
industry. But
liking
 it isn’t the same as
wanting
 it. And
wanting
 it isn’t the same as
needing
 it.

Liking
 is an aesthetic state. You can turn it on and turn it off. As dopamine is
released into the NA, our consumption of a Big Mac heightens our sense of reward.
Then comes the insulin rush, and that should be the end of it. But when you’re insulin
resistant,
wanting
 is a psychological state and
needing
 becomes a physiologic state.
You can’t turn it on and off anymore. This is the nature of addiction to any substance of
abuse. It’s what happens with nicotine, morphine, cocaine, and alcohol—and it happens
with food. It can happen to anyone. It can happen to you.
Substance dependence, in this case synonymous with addiction, is defined by the
American Psychological Association (APA) as “a maladaptive pattern of substance
abuse leading to clinically significant impairment or distress.” There is currently no
standardized definition for food addiction despite many hypotheses in the medical
literature. There are seven criteria for substance dependence according to the APA
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
, the DSM-IV-TR. The first two are considered
physiologic, whereas criteria 3–7 are considered psychological dependence. All these
are seen in the obese, especially those who frequent fast food restaurants. To be
considered addicted to any substance of abuse, one must meet at least three of the
seven.
1.
Tolerance.
 This is defined as the need for more substance to get the same effect,
or when the same amount of substance produces less effect with continued use. That Big
Mac still generates the dopamine rush, but the reward isn’t maintained, as your insulin
won’t clear the dopamine from the NA. Since insulin resistance generates leptin
resistance, you can’t stop the dopamine neurons in the VTA from firing in the first
place. So your NA is awash in dopamine, and the insulin rush from the meal can’t turn
it off. Since your hypothalamus
and
 your NA won’t respond to the leptin signal, the
drive to eat just keeps coming. And here’s the kicker: the more and the longer your NA
is exposed to dopamine, the more those D

 receptors are going to be down-regulated.
After chronic dopamine exposure, the D

 receptors themselves start to disappear. The
locks vanish, much to the chagrin of the keys, which have nowhere to go. Now it takes
more dopamine to ensure that the few receptors that don’t disappear are occupied. You
need to eat more Big Macs just to get the same level of reward.
2.
Withdrawal.
 This is characterized by physical signs (such as tremors) and
psychological ones (anxiety, depression). This occurs due to lack of dopamine D

receptor occupancy. In animals, anxiety and depression are indicated by unwillingness
to spend time in a risky environment. In humans, withdrawal is expressed as symptoms
of depression and anxiety. If you try to stop eating those Big Macs, your dopamine
drops and you are consumed by feelings of anxiety and depression (just like those
patients treated with rimonabant—the “anti-munchie” medicine). The only choice is to
increase the dopamine, reoccupy those diminished D

 receptors, and maintain the
vicious cycle of Big Mac consumption.
If you need proof, I suggest you rent the 2004 documentary
Super Size Me.
 The
film’s author and star, Morgan Spurlock, began as a reasonably healthy specimen at 6
feet 2 inches and 185 pounds (for a BMI of 23.8, within the normal range). He was
eating a reasonably healthy diet (his girlfriend was a vegan chef) before beginning a
thirty-day ordeal of eating every meal at McDonald’s. By day eighteen, he relates to the
camera, “You
know, I was feeling awful. I was feeling like s--t. I was feeling sick, and
unhappy…. Started eating; now I feel great. I feel so great, it’s crazy.” Mr. Spurlock
just described withdrawal. In eighteen days, he went from being a person with healthy
eating habits to a fast food addict.
3.
Bingeing.
 This is defined as an escalation of intake, using a greater amount of the
substance or using for a longer duration than intended. In animals, this can be measured
by an increase in the number of times the animal presses a lever to self-administer a
drug—or, in the case of a human, continuing to eat after satiety has been achieved. One
can easily conceptualize binge drinking (think of the movie
Animal House
 or your
stereotypical chug-a-lug frat guy), but binge eating is harder to define. It is highly
subjective, since what is a large amount to some may not be perceived as unusual by
others. Binge eating disorder includes eating until uncomfortable; eating when not
hungry; eating alone due to shame; feeling disgusted, depressed, or guilty after
overeating; and marked distress over the bingeing. Many afflicted people will consume
massive amounts of food, such as an entire sheet cake, alone and in the dark of their
kitchen, with massive shame.
4.
Desire or attempts to cut down or quit.
 As mentioned previously, diets and
miracle drugs generate over $160 billion annually. Those who are overweight or obese
are almost always on some new diet kick and are frequently “weight cycling,” or yo-
yoing. Juicing, cleansing, meat only, carbs only—they grasp for any possible solution.
And it’s almost never sustainable. After a period of days, weeks, or months, they
frequently binge on the substance from which they were abstaining (often sugar), and
the weight is gained back. The sense of failure and ensuing depression can be
overwhelming. The obese then read a new article or book about the latest craze and
begin the cycle again
ad infinitum
. It’s not that they aren’t trying. Their lives are often
consumed by these attempts.
5.
Craving or seeking.
 This is described as an intense drive to self-administer
drugs. In food addiction research, craving is illustrated by the motivation to seek food.
Drug craving and seeking have been experimentally described as a form of learning,
where dopamine signaling facilitates the consolidation of memory; past experiences are
used to inform future
decisions. Rats “press the lever” for drugs because they have
learned that it is rewarding. We press the credit card button for Frappucinos.
6.
Interference with life.
 This is defined by important work, social, or other life
activities being compromised. Obesity can significantly hamper an individual’s quality
of life. Mobility is markedly more difficult. Airlines may refuse you passage if you
don’t fit into the seat. Employers may refuse to hire you based on your weight. Diabetes
can lead to limb amputation, requiring use of a wheelchair. During the thirty days of
Spurlock’s
Super Size Me
 adventure, he gained 24.5 pounds, experienced mood
swings, sexual dysfunction, and fat accumulation in his liver. While his experience of
eating every meal at McDonald’s may be deemed extreme, these physical and
physiological effects occurred within only a thirty-day period.
7.
Use despite negative consequences.
 This is defined as continued use despite
knowledge that use will make the problems worse. The health consequences associated
with obesity are numerous (see
chapter 19
). Despite knowing and experiencing these
health problems, the eating pattern continues unabated.
What Makes Fast Food Addictive?
In humans, food addiction is often compared to established criteria for substance
dependence.

 One problem with this approach is that it shifts focus away from the
potentially addictive properties of the food and onto the individual “afflicted” with the
addiction. We prefer to focus on the addictive potential of the food itself by placing it
in the scope of other identified substances of abuse. Alcohol is the most analogous
substance to fast food for several reasons, including its biochemistry (see
chapters 11
and

).
Fast food is high in calories, sugar, fat, salt, and caffeine. It is highly processed,
energy dense, and specifically designed to be highly palatable. The majority of the fiber
and a portion of the vitamins and minerals present in the original food have been
extracted in processing (see
chapter 14
). Sugar, salt, and other additives are used to
boost flavor. The end product is packaged and sold conveniently to deliver the
contents. Which of these components could be addictive? Or are they addictive all
together?
A market share analysis of McDonald’s, the largest hamburger chain in the world,
shows that its Big Mac and French fries are the top two most popular menu items. Extra
value meals constitute 70 percent of purchases at McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Burger
King. The most popular combination at McDonald’s is a Big Mac, medium French
fries, and medium regular soda, providing 1,130 calories for $5.99.

But we’re talking about addiction here. So let’s make it a large. Consider a food
label for a typical fast food meal, consisting of a Big Mac, large French fries, and large
Coke (32 ounces) (
figure 5.1
). No percentage daily value (%DV) is listed for sugar
because there is currently no recommended daily intake
for sugar (see
chapter 16
).
Keep in mind that 50 percent of the American population is consuming this or a similar
meal at least once per week.
Fig. 5.1. Supersize Me? A McDonald’s Meal and Its Nutritional Value.
 A Big Mac, large fries, and a large
soda provide 1,360 calories (two thirds of a standard day’s allotment) and 1,380 milligrams sodium (almost an entire
day’s allotment). While the fat content is 38 percent of calories (which is not bad), the sugar content is 95 grams, or
19 teaspoons, or 390 calories, which is more than double what the American Heart Association recommends for one
day.
Salt
This sample meal contains 1,380 milligrams of sodium (salt). The 2005 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans provided a “tolerable upper intake level” of 2,300
milligrams of sodium per day, which is why the %DV of the sample meal is 54 percent.
Processed foods of many sorts contribute more than 3,400 milligrams of sodium per
day to the average American diet. Salt is one method by which the food industry can
preserve foods and increase their shelf life. So salt and calories almost always go
together. (Think potato chips.) But is it addictive? Data to support addiction to salt are
currently confined to animal models. Studies in rats show dopamine signaling in
response to salt, and administration of opioids encourages bingeing on salt. However,
in humans, salt intake has traditionally been conceived as a learned preference rather
than an addiction. The preference for salty foods is likely learned early in life. Four- to
six-month-old infants establish a salt preference based on the sodium content of breast
milk, water used to mix formula, and the rest of their diet. But clearly people can
modulate their salt intake. For example, patients who crave salt due to diseases of the
adrenal gland can reduce their salt intake when given the appropriate medicine. Also,
people’s taste for salt can be retrained; hypertensive adults can be retrained to a lower-
salt diet within twelve weeks.

 So, based on the criteria for an addictive substance, salt
doesn’t make the cut.
Fat
The high fat content of fast food is vital to its rewarding properties. This sample fast
food meal contains 89 percent of the daily fat intake for an individual on a 2,000-
calorie diet. In feeding studies, excess calories from fat are more efficiently stored than
excess calories from carbohydrates (90–95 percent versus 75–85 percent). Therefore,
fat intake has always traditionally been assumed to be the major determinant of weight
gain. Animals will binge on pure fat when given intermittent access to it.
They binge
regardless of the type of fat ingested, which suggests that it is that fat
content
 and not
the type of fat present in fast food that encourages overeating (see
chapter 10
).
However, rat models do not demonstrate other features of addiction to fat, such as
tolerance or withdrawal. Keep in mind, however, that so-called “high-fat foods” are
almost always also high in starch (e.g., pizza) or sugar (e.g., cookies). In fact, adding
sugar significantly enhances preference for high-fat foods among normal-weight
people.

 Thus, the combination of high fat along with high sugar is likely to be more
addictive than high fat alone.
Caffeine
Soda is an integral part of the fast food meal. If you consumed a large soda with your
McDonald’s value meal, the caffeine content would be approximately 58 milligrams.
Soft drink manufacturers identify caffeine as a flavoring agent in their beverages, but
only 8 percent of frequent soda drinkers can detect the difference in a blind taste test of
caffeine-containing and caffeine-free cola.

 Thus, the most likely function of the
caffeine in soda is to increase the salience (the quality that makes it “stand out”) of an
already highly rewarding (sugared) beverage. Dependence on caffeine is well
established, meeting all the DSM-IV-TR criteria for both physiologic and
psychological dependence. In fact, up to 30 percent of people who consume caffeine
may meet the criteria for dependence. Headache (attributed to increased cerebral blood
flow velocity), fatigue, and impaired task performance have all been shown during
caffeine withdrawal. In addition, reinforcement of intermittent caffeine consumption
leads to tolerance.
While children get their caffeine from soft drinks and chocolate, adults get most of
their caffeine from coffee and tea. An 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains 95–200
milligrams of caffeine, depending on how it is brewed. The late comedian and social
commentator George Carlin famously referred to coffee as “Caucasian crack.”
However, few customers these days order a regular brewed coffee at chain restaurants.
A study of Starbucks customers showed that the majority of them order blended
drinks.

 The ever popular “grande” (extra large) Mocha
Frappucchino (without
whipped cream) has 260 calories and 53 grams of sugar. Thus, as a known substance of
abuse, caffeine in coffee drinks and soda is part and parcel of the phenomenon of food
addiction.
Sugar
Although anecdotal reports abound supporting human “sugar addiction,” we are still not
completely sure whether this is full-fledged dependence or merely habituation. Adding
a soda to a fast food meal increases the sugar content tenfold. While Coca-Cola
estimates that currently 42 percent of soft drinks sold nationwide are diet drinks (e.g.,
Coke Zero), when purchased at McDonald’s, 71 percent are the sugar-sweetened
variety. In fact, in 2009 only seven items on the McDonald’s menu did not include sugar
—French fries, hash browns, sausage, Chicken McNuggets (without dipping sauce),
Diet Coke, black coffee, and iced tea (without sugar). While soda intake is
independently related to obesity,

 fast food eaters clearly drink more soda. It is likely
that the widespread phenomenon of “soda addiction” is driven by the inclusion of
caffeine, a known addictive substance.
All criteria for sugar addiction have been demonstrated in rodent models.

 First,
rats exposed to intermittent sugar access (following restriction) will binge. Second,
these animals show signs of withdrawal (teeth chattering, tremors, shakes, and anxiety)
when the sugar is withdrawn. Third, seeking and craving have been demonstrated
where animals consume more sugar after a two-week imposed abstinence—just like
Salvador and his soda. Elevated dopamine levels perpetuate the binge, and
overconsumption increases with time, consistent with tolerance. Finally, cross-
sensitization has been demonstrated in sugar-addicted rats who readily switch to
alcohol or amphetamine use. So, based on the data, sugar is addictive, and soda is
doubly so.
Deconstructing Darwin
There is some evidence that sugar may be addictive in humans. Experimental studies
show that obese subjects will use sugar to treat psychological symptoms. Overweight
women who were self-reported carbohydrate cravers reported greater relief from
various mood disorders in response to a carbohydrate-containing beverage as
compared to a protein drink. But perhaps the best evidence for an opiate-like effect of
sugar is the product Sweet-Ease. This is a sugar solution into which hospitals dip
pacifiers for newborn boys undergoing circumcision, to reduce the pain of the
procedure.
Evolutionarily, sweetness was the signal to our ancestors that something was safe to
eat because no sweet foods are acutely poisonous. (Even Jamaican vomiting sickness
occurs only after consumption of unripe ackee fruit, which is not sweet.) So we
gravitate to sweetness as a default. How many times do parents have to introduce a new
food before a baby will accept it? About ten to thirteen times. But if that new food is
sweet, how many times do you have to introduce it? Only once. And if a sucrose
solution on a pacifier can provide enough analgesia for performing a circumcision,
that’s an evolutionary winner, isn’t it?
Pleasure versus Happiness
You may have heard of the “gross national happiness index,” an indicator that measures
quality of life or social progress in more psychological terms than does the economic
indicator of gross domestic product (GDP). By all accounts, America is not very happy.
Despite having the highest GDP, we score forty-fourth on the happiness index. Of
course, our workaholic attitudes (Americans are afforded the least vacation time in the
developed world) and the recent economic downturn all contribute to our unhappiness.
But could our unhappiness be related to our food?

By all estimations, obese people are not happy. The question is whether their
unhappiness is a cause or a result of their obesity. At this point we can’t say for sure,
and it is entirely possible that both are correct. Here’s how.
Happiness is not just an
aesthetic state. Happiness is also a biochemical state, mediated by the neurotransmitter
serotonin. The “serotonin hypothesis” argues that deficiency of brain serotonin causes
severe clinical depression, which is why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) which increase brain serotonin, such as Wellbutrin and Prozac, are used as
treatment. Interestingly, these medications are also used for obesity. One way to
increase serotonin synthesis in the brain is to eat lots of carbohydrates.

You can see where this is going. If you’re serotonin-deficient, you’re going to want
to boost your serotonin any way you can. Eating more carbohydrates, especially sugar,
initially does double duty: it facilitates serotonin transport and it substitutes pleasure
for happiness in the short term. But as the D

 receptor down-regulates, more sugar is
needed for the same effect. The insulin resistance drives leptin resistance (see
chapter

), and the brain thinks it’s starved, driving a vicious cycle of consumption to generate
a meager pleasure in the face of persistent unhappiness. And this vicious cycle can
happen to anyone. Just substitute a little pleasure for a little unhappiness, and presto!
Addiction in no time at all.
You, the Jury…
There is one obvious hole in this thesis, and I’m sure you’ve been chomping on it
throughout this entire chapter. Can anyone become addicted to fast food? Everyone in
America eats fast food, but not everyone is addicted. With narcotics, chronic use pretty
much assures addiction—ask Rush Limbaugh about his OxyContin—but fast food
doesn’t fit this paradigm. There are lots of habitual fast food consumers who can stop if
they wished. Instead, is there a subset of people who are “addictable” and who have
chosen food as their preferred substance of abuse? This might explain why people who
stop smoking start eating.
Doctors are starting to come around to the concept of food addiction. Nora Volkow,
the head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is on record supporting the
concept of food addiction.

 Yet not everyone is sold on the idea that obesity and
addiction are related. For instance, in 2012 a British group challenged the obesity-
addiction model,

 arguing that not
all obese people demonstrate addiction, that not all
obese people have reduced dopamine receptors on neuroimaging, and that rats are not
humans (although, of course, some humans are rats). By that token, not everyone who
drinks becomes an alcoholic, but we do know that some people become addicted.
So what’s your verdict? Is Salvador addicted to his sodas? Is fast food addictive?
After treating obese children for the last fifteen years, I can categorically say that there
are loads of people who can’t kick the habit. In fact, it’s more likely that children are
unable to—perhaps because they were raised on the stuff or because their brains are
more susceptible.

 There are several caveats to declaring fast food addictive. How
often do you partake (consistently or intermittently)? With whom do you partake (with
your family, or alone)? What do you order? How old are you? And, most important, do
you have a soda (or sweet tea in the southeastern United States) with your meal? I’ve
laid out the data that demonstrate that fat and salt increase the appeal of the fast food
meal, but it’s the sugar and the caffeine that are the true hooks. We’ll come back to this
time and again throughout the book, as this is where the action is.
Chapter 6
T
Stress and “Comfort Food”
Janie is thirteen years old. When she was five she developed a
hypothalamic brain tumor, which was surgically removed. In the
subsequent seven years, she gained 160 pounds (to a maximum weight of
242 pounds) and her oral glucose tolerance test showed massive insulin
release, consistent with hypothalamic obesity. On an experimental
protocol, our surgeons performed an experimental operation on Janie,
which cut her vagus nerve. In the nine months following the surgery, she
lost 22 pounds, reduced her hunger, had more energy, and felt much
better. Then she disappeared from the clinic for nine months. When she
returned, she had regained the 22 pounds and was back up to her
maximum weight. She stated that the surgery had removed her hunger. So
how and why did she gain it all back? It turns out she switched schools
in sixth grade. The kids in the new school hurled insults, calling her
Fatso, Miss Piggy, and The Blob. Despite a lack of hunger, the stress of
her new situation caused her to eat incessantly. Janie switched to a new
middle school, where she got along better with her peers, and lost
weight again.
his poor young lady is triply cursed. First she gets a brain tumor. Then she gets obese
as a complication of the brain tumor. To top it all off, she has the misfortune of being
a teenager (possibly the worst of the three). Even though we did our best to treat this
girl’s biochemical difficulty, the social difficulty turned out to be even more potent.
I take care of kids for a living. While the majority of them are cute and adorable,
some kids can be downright mean. Especially adolescents. Bad behavior is
de rigueur
nowadays. How many movies out of Hollywood play on this adage? Rent
Mean Girls
,
Sixteen Candles
, or
Can’t Buy Me Love
 in case you’ve forgotten what high school is
like. Maybe it’s the testosterone and estrogen of puberty that makes some teenagers
angry and turns them into bullies. Perhaps they build themselves up by taking other kids
down with degrading remarks and slurs. Maybe it’s their upbringing. They see how
their parents handle social issues and they emulate them. (Beware the mothers of the
PTA in the San Fernando Valley.) But I do know one thing: many kids (and adults)
respond to psychological stress by eating.
Coincident with the rise in obesity throughout our society is an increased
prevalence and severity of psychological stress.

 Two mechanisms by which stress
leads to obesity are stress-induced eating and stress-induced fat deposition.

 Both
animals and humans have been documented to increase their food intake following
stress or negative emotion, even if the organism is not hungry. Further, the type of food
eaten tends to be high in sugar, fat, or both. There’s a load of evidence that humans are
more stressed today than we were thirty years ago, which correlates directly with the
expansion of our waistlines.
Cortisol: Can’t Live with It, Can’t Live Without It
The relationship between stress, obesity, and metabolic disease begins with the
hormone cortisol, which is released by your adrenal glands (located on top of your
kidneys). This is perhaps the most important hormone in your body. Too little cortisol,
and you can die. If you’re missing any other hormone in your body—growth, thyroid,
sex, or water-retaining hormones—you’ll feel lousy and your life will be miserable,
but you won’t perish. But if you’re missing cortisol, you can’t handle any form of
physical stress. As David Williams stated in the 2008 PBS series
Unnatural Causes
,
“Stress helps to motivate us. In our society today everybody experiences stress. The
person who has no stress is a person who is dead.” The acute rise in cortisol keeps you
from going into shock when you dehydrate, improves memory
and immune function,
reduces inflammation, and increases vigilance. Normally cortisol will peak in a
stressful situation (when you’re being chased by a lion or your boss is yelling at you for
not getting the memo). Cortisol is necessary, in small doses and in short bursts.
Conversely, long-term exposure to large doses of cortisol will also kill you—it’ll
just take longer. If pressures (social, familial, cultural, etc.) are relentless, the stress
responses remain activated for months or even years. When cortisol floods the
bloodstream, it raises blood pressure; increases the blood glucose level, which can
precipitate diabetes; and increases the heart rate. Human research shows that cortisol
specifically increases caloric intake of “comfort foods” (e.g., chocolate cake).

 And
cortisol doesn’t cause just any old weight gain. It specifically increases the visceral fat
(see
chapter 8
), which is the fat depot associated with cardiovascular disease and
metabolic syndrome.
Beginning in the 1970s and lasting more than thirty years, the seminal “Whitehall
study” charted the health of twenty-nine thousand British civil servants.

 In the
beginning, the scientists hypothesized that the high-power executives would have the
highest rates of heart attack and coronary disease. The opposite proved to be true.
Those lowest on the totem pole exhibited the highest levels of cortisol and of chronic
disease. This held true not just on the bottom rung: the second person down on the
social ladder had a higher likelihood of developing diseases than the person on the top
rung, the third had a higher predisposition than the second, and so on. Death rates and
illness correlate with low social status, even after controlling for behavior (e.g.,
smoking).
The same holds true in America. The prevalence of diseases such as diabetes,
stroke, and heart disease are highest among those who suffer from the most stress,
namely middle- and lower-class Americans. These stressors are acutely felt in children
as well. Almost 20 percent of American children live in poverty. The lifelong
consequences of food and housing insecurity are toxic to the brain and alter its
architecture early in life.

 In particular, cortisol kills neurons that play a role in the
inhibition of food intake.

 Whether one builds a strong or weak foundation in childhood
is a great determinant of later health and eating patterns. Thus, childhood stress
increases the risk of obesity during adolescence and adulthood.
Some of the factors associated with lower thresholds for stress and higher “cortisol
reactivity” are low socioeconomic status, job stress, being female, scoring high in
dietary restraint (a measure of chronic dieting), and an overall lack of power and
confidence. Taking three buses to get anywhere, working two or more jobs, figuring out
how to put food on the table, and not knowing whether you will be able to pay the rent
—all significantly affect not just your state of mind but also your physiological state.
And if you are not Caucasian, the stresses associated with racism will double these
health effects. African Americans and Latinos suffer from higher mortality rates of
nearly every disease than their white counterparts. While there are certainly genetic
influences, stress plays a major role in health disparities among the races.
The Science of Stress
The stress response is a cascade of adaptive responses that originate in the central
nervous system. When an individual perceives stress (anything from a plane crash to a
calculus test), the body interprets and processes the threat in an area of the brain called
the amygdala. From there, the amygdala switches on two other systems. First, like a
game of telephone, the amygdala tells the hypothalamus, which tells the pituitary, which
tells the adrenal gland to release cortisol. In an acute situation, cortisol feeds back on
the hypothalamus to stop further secretion, and its effects would be short term and
limited. (
I escaped the lion! Ah, sweet relief. Time for a nap
.) This negative feedback
loop should protect the brain and body from prolonged, detrimental cortisol exposure.
Second, the amygdala activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), raising the heart
rate. Both cortisol and the SNS raise blood sugar and blood pressure, to prepare the
individual for meeting and adapting to stress. These systems should shut off after the
stress has passed.
However, either chronic stress or heightened responses to stress due to ineffective
coping strategies will unleash a long-term cortisol cascade. In these prolonged stressful
situations, the cortisol is unregulated. Why doesn’t the cortisol feed back in the state of
chronic stress to control its own
release? This is one of the biggest questions in science
today. Apparently, the amygdala’s ability to perceive the cortisol signal becomes
reduced in response to the excess cortisol supply. Chronic exposure suppresses the
negative feedback of cortisol on the brain. How and why this happens is still unknown.
Whatever the mechanism, it’s a vicious cycle: stress breeds more cortisol, which in
turn breeds more stress.

“Stressed” Is “Desserts” Spelled Backward
Over several years, prolonged cortisol leads to excessive food intake—but not just
any
food. Human research shows that cortisol specifically increases caloric intake of
“comfort foods” (those with high energy density or high fat and high sugar). Your
spouse is late and the kids won’t stop whining? Break out the Ben & Jerry’s.
What predisposes certain people to stress-induced eating? For one thing, it’s not the
stress itself; it’s the
response
 to stress. Stress, like art, is in the eye of the beholder.
The same level of stress can have varying effects on different people. The perception of
chronic stress causes increased caloric intake of “comfort foods,” but only among those
with high cortisol reactivity. People who are “stress eaters” exhibit significant
increases in insulin, weight, and cortisol at night (normally the time for cortisol to be
very low) during a stressful period. My colleague Elissa Epel at the University of
California, San Francisco showed that those subjects who generated the greatest amount
of cortisol in response to a psychological stressor also consumed the greatest amount of
high-fat, sugary food.

 Stress has also been postulated to play a role in metabolic
syndrome in childhood, a time when eating patterns and fat cells are “programmed.”
Stress may affect food intake in several ways. One outcome of stress is reduced
sleep, which is both a contributor to and a consequence of obesity. We’re all getting
less sleep than we used to, especially children (Janie included).

 BMI increases over
time among short sleepers. And just because you sleep less does not mean you are
filling your waking hours with exercise. At the biochemical level, acute sleep loss is
associated with elevations in markers of systemic inflammation and signs of metabolic
syndrome.
Sleep deprivation has been shown to increase cortisol and reduce leptin, and
in doing so, mimic starvation and hunger. At the brain level, sleep deprivation
increases the hunger hormone ghrelin, which increases the “value” each of us puts on
food, and also activates the reward system,

 making you eat even more chocolate cake.
Conversely, poor sleep is common among obese individuals. This is in part because
high BMI is a strong predictor of obstructive sleep apnea, which, due to retention of
carbon dioxide, appears to make obesity even worse.
The role of stress and cortisol in eating extends from the physiologic to the
pathologic, and from overeating to undereating. When I was a pediatric resident
working thirty-six hours out of every forty-eight, our group was divided into two
cohorts: those who hit the cafeteria and those who lived on coffee. I tried the coffee, but
my hands shook too much when I was threading catheters into umbilical arteries on
premature infants, so I turned to food. I gained 45 pounds during residency, and I
haven’t taken them off yet.
A monkey model that drives cortisol up is called the variable foraging demand
model, which is the animal equivalent to “food insecurity.”

 In this model, monkeys
have access to food in one of three ways: (1) ad lib, in which the food is available all
the time; (2) at every meal, the animal has to work to find food that has been hidden in a
maze of tubes; or (3) a random combination of the two, called variable foraging.
Despite the fact that the animals in the second group have to work at finding their food,
their body weights and cortisol levels are similar to those of the ad lib monkeys: they
know what they have to do to attain their next meal. However, for the third group, the
variable foragers, the uncertainty of the food availability drives up their cortisol levels
and they become markedly obese.
Stress and cortisol also promote faster addiction to various drugs of abuse and
likely food as well. Experiments in animals emphasize that stress or cortisol
administration (particularly uncontrollable stress) increases the likelihood of abusing
drugs such as cocaine. Another way to drive up cortisol in monkeys is by placing them
in group housing, thereby exposing them to social hierarchy. Invariably, one animal will
rise in the social order to become the alpha male, or the leader of the cage. This animal,
akin to an all-powerful CEO, will have the lowest cortisol levels. The cortisol levels
of the subordinates will be much higher. When all the monkeys are then provided
access to cocaine for self-administration, while the alpha male won’t get hooked, the
subordinates become addicts. This can also happen with food. Thus the stress and
reward systems are linked, making food addiction among those who eat to manage their
stress a
faît accompli
.
Cortisol and Insulin: The One-Two Punch to Your Gut
In both rats and people, when cortisol goes up, insulin does, too. After all, if cortisol
makes you eat, your insulin levels will rise to drive the consumed energy into fat tissue.
So is cortisol the energy intake hormone and insulin the energy storage hormone? Does
cortisol have effects on obesity that are different from those of insulin? Or are the two
always yoked together? Are their effects redundant or synergistic? These are not just
academic points; they are crucial issues in the decision tree on how to go about
preventing and treating obesity.
The only way to answer these questions is to control each hormone separately. You
can’t do this in humans, but you can in rats. In a truly heroic set of experiments, my
University of California, San Francisco colleagues James Warne and Mary Dallman
answered this question beautifully.

 In short—insulin makes you gain weight, while
cortisol tells you where to put it. They do different things to your food intake and your
fat cells (see
chapter 8
), but they synergize to make metabolic syndrome worse (see
chapter 9
).
Cortisol and Metabolic Syndrome
There are boatloads of evidence that humans are more stressed today than we were
thirty years ago. These stresses occur at home, in the workplace, and at school; in other
words, all people all the time. Stress (e.g., job stress), depression, and excess cortisol
are all linked to metabolic syndrome. For instance, psychosocial stresses correlate with
risk of myocardial infarction (heart attacks) in adults. One of the hallmarks of metabolic
syndrome is excessive cortisol due to adrenal gland overactivation. These examples all
suggest that cortisol is a primary player in the development of metabolic syndrome (see
chapter 9
).
Deconstructing Darwin
Why should cortisol lay down fat in the abdomen, where it is more likely to cause
disease (see
chapter 8
), as opposed to your love handles? Our stressed ancestors
sometimes needed lots of energy very fast, to escape the lion or to battle their
neighbors. Belly fat breaks down into fatty acids faster, and has a direct line to the liver
for burning. So having some extra energy that you could “mainline” right into your liver
was adaptive, when the stresses were physical. Nowadays, however, stress is anything
but physical, and now that abdominal fat is a liability rather than an asset.
The Limbic Triangle: Disordered Eating, Obesity, and
Disease
These three brain pathways (hunger, reward, stress) drive hyperinsulinemia (excess
insulin levels), resulting in obesity and metabolic syndrome (see
chapter 9
). We call
this model the “limbic triangle”—similar to the Bermuda Triangle: once you get in, you
can’t get out.

 Chronic insulin action at the VMH inhibits leptin signaling, which is
interpreted as starvation. This decreases SNS activity (sloth) and increases vagal
activity (hunger). In the VTA, chronic insulin deregulates hedonic reward pathways by
inhibiting leptin signaling (reward). You want to eat more, especially high-fat and high-
sugar treats, which results in excessive energy intake. Chronic activation of the
amygdala increases levels of cortisol (stress). By itself, this promotes excess food
intake and insulin resistance, ratcheting up insulin levels and accelerating weight gain.
This is what is going on in virtually every obese individual. Hunger, reward, and
stress conspire to undo attempts at weight loss. The behaviors of “gluttony” and “sloth”
are very real, but they are results of changes in brain biochemistry. And as you will see
in
Part 3
, these behaviors are also a result of the biochemistry of the fat cells that drive
their growth.

“Chewing” the Fat
Chapter 7
The Birth, Care,
and Feeding of a Fat Cell
Kay is a seven-year-old girl who was born at a normal weight. She first
visited the clinic at age two, when she was 45 pounds (twice normal
size) and her BMI was 30 (double the normal BMI for her age). Her
mother and sister are both rail-thin. Lab testing showed massive insulin
release, similar to that in the brain tumor children. Kay’s mother kept
her from all problem foods and promoted exercise as much as she could,
but without effect. Over the next five years, Kay tried diet and exercise,
and various weight-loss medications. Nothing seemed to slow down her
weight gain. At age seven, she weighed 140 pounds, and she had a fatty
liver, lipid problems, and hypertension. As a last resort, she had a lap-
band procedure, to reduce her stomach’s capacity. She was our youngest
patient to undergo bariatric surgery at the time. Within six months post-
op she had lost 30 pounds, and her face was now separate from her
neck. All her labs improved. Her mother was ecstatic, in no small part
because Kay could now wipe her own behind.
Your Fat, Your Fate?
In a nutshell, your body fat is your biggest long-term risk for infirmity. Nothing
correlates with diabetes, heart disease, and cancer better than your
fat. So is your fat
your
fate
? Everyone says, “Lose the fat to extend and improve your life,” but virtually
no one can do it. So how do you lose the fat? Better yet, how do you prevent it from
arriving in the first place, and preferably leave your muscle mass in place? In order to
answer these questions a little more knowledge is required about what causes fat
accumulation.
Each of us starts out as a single cell, the product of the fertilization of a sperm and
an egg. As an adult, we end up having a total of between 5 and 10 trillion cells, with
more than 250 cell types in our bodies. Where did the fat cells come from and why are
they there in the first place? How do you make an adipocyte (fat cell)? What drives its
proliferation? Can you make fewer, and would you even want to? Once a fat cell is
made, how do you fill it? Finally, for all the marbles, once a fat cell is filled, how do
you empty it?
These are the questions that drive scientists and the pharmaceutical industry in their
quest to relegate obesity to the dustbin of medical oddities (and make a bundle in the
process). The sad thing is, here we are, thirty years into the obesity pandemic, and we
haven’t yet harnessed the science to help us.
How Do You Make a Fat Cell?
The size of your fat tissue depot depends on two properties: fat cell number and size. In
reality, the number of fat cells you have dictates your ultimate fate after they have been
created. Once made, fat cells want to be filled. Think of a fat cell as a balloon. When
empty, it is pretty small and many can be stored in a bag without taking up much space.
The fat content is what blows the balloon up; when many are put together, they can fill
an entire room. So to control obesity, you need only control your fat cell number. Alas,
this is easier said than done. How and when do fat cells get born? In the early 1970s,
Jules Hirsch, at Rockefeller University, demonstrated that your fat cell number is
determined by age two. More recently, research has confirmed that while there is a
constant low-level turnover, the majority of fat cells are formed very early in life.

Why do we even need fat cells? The flippant answer is that without
them, girls
would look like boys. The evolutionary answer is that fat cells are repositories of
energy and are necessary for survival of the species, especially in times of famine. Fat
cells are protective; they provide cushioning of vital organs. In addition, specialized fat
cells provide heat after you’re born, to keep you from succumbing to the elements. Fat
cells are not just storage devices. They are active participants in, and are necessary for,
your metabolic health. As you will see in
chapter 8
, you need your fat cells. Fat cells
are the difference between being the picture of health and suffering a miserable,
lingering death.
What makes one person fatter than the next? How is it that Kay and her sister—
children raised in identical environments with the same parents, values, and meals—
can be so physically different from each other? Why does one child dream of nothing
but soccer while the other obsesses over doughnuts? Everyone thinks they are in
control, but the reality is they aren’t. No one is. So please, people, give up on this idea
that you are in control of your fat cells. They were laid down a long time ago. Control
over your fat is an illusion promulgated by the weight-loss and fashion industry to keep
you in tow, paying big bucks. Your mother was more likely in control before you were
born, and she didn’t even know it. (Another reason to blame Mom at the therapist’s
office, as if you needed one.)
Over the last twenty-five years, birth weight has increased worldwide by as much
as 200 grams (half a pound), coincident with the obesity pandemic.

 Is this conferring
the risk for obesity on the newborn? It is likely that maternal weight gain is translated
into fetal body fat; the more weight mothers gain during their pregnancy, the greater the
birth weight of the newborn;

 and the more fat cells early on, the greater the health risk
later on.

 Mom can bestow a blessing or a curse; what she does and eats during her
pregnancy can result in an altered destiny—either way, for better or for worse.
Your fat cell number is determined before you’re born and is dictated through four
separate physiological pathways, none of which can you alter now.
1.
Genetics
. When we talk about genetics, we mean a change in the sequence of
our DNA. Scientists routinely say that obesity is 50 percent
genetics (nature) and 50
percent environment (nurture). We do know of a few genetic mutations in the energy
balance pathway that clearly predetermine your risk, which accounts for about 2
percent of morbid obesity. However, despite exhaustive searches, not that many people
have genetic mutations to account for their obesity. Researchers worldwide have
scanned the human genome and have identified thirty-two genes that are associated with
obesity in the general population.

 Altogether, these genes explain a total of 9 percent
of obesity. And even if one person had every single bad gene variation, it would
account for only about 22 pounds—hardly enough to explain our current obesity
pandemic. Lastly, the genetic pool doesn’t change that fast, so the gene argument can’t
explain the last thirty years. All these investigations show that we need to look past
genetics as a cause of obesity.
2.
Epigenetics.
 Epigenetics is different from genetics. It refers to changes in the
areas around our genes that can cause them to be turned on or off, usually
inappropriately, and that over time can result in the development of various diseases.
Think of epigenetics as the On-Off switch attached to the dimmer of your living room
chandelier. The gene is the light bulb; the epigene is the light switch. If the light bulb is
defective or the switch is frozen in the Off position, the dimmer function is useless as it
is, as it is constantly giving off low light and you are unable to read. Likewise, epigenes
control the extent to which the gene turns on.
Epigenetics has become a very hot area of investigation. Here are four reasons why
you should care. First, an epigenetic alteration can cause as much havoc as a genetic
alteration, but the actual DNA sequence remains unchanged, so even with a full genome
analysis, you can have defective epigenetics without knowing it. Second, epigenetic
changes usually occur after conception but before birth. You are not just the product of
your genes; you are equally the product of your epigenes. Third, changes in maternal
nutrition or altered physical stress to the mother are felt by the fetus through the
placenta. They can modify gene expression and function, affecting the child for the rest
of his life. Fourth, and the most ominous fact of all: once your epigenetic pattern has
changed, there’s a better-than-even-money chance that you will transmit this same
epigenetic change to your offspring, and they to theirs,
ad infinitum
. A recent study
demonstrated
that the epigenetic marks that babies harbor in their DNA at birth predict
their degree of fat accumulation at age nine years,

 suggesting that what the fetus
experiences through the placenta has a huge impact on future risk of obesity.
3.
Developmental programming
. A relatively new field in medicine is known as
developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD), or developmental programming.
We now assume that a hostile intrauterine environment (undernutrition, overnutrition, or
maternal stress) transmits some signal to the fetus, which conveys information about
future threat:
It’s a tough world out there, kid; best be ready for it
. This drives the
infant to store extra energy and increase its fat after birth when there is no need to do
so, to the ultimate detriment of health later on. Such a baby’s intrauterine and postnatal
environment are mismatched. The child is “programmed” for survival at the expense of
longevity.
David Barker first postulated that prenatal biological influences could affect
postnatal outcomes for obesity. He observed that maternal nutrition affected the fetus.
Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (very small at birth) were at an increased risk
for future obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

 This finding was corroborated by the
Dutch Famine Study.

 At the end of World War II, for a four-month period, the official
daily rations in the Netherlands were between 400 and 800 calories per person. Those
who were undernourished as fetuses developed obesity and metabolic syndrome (see
chapter 9
) in middle age.
Several studies of SGA newborns demonstrate that they exhibit rapid catch-up
growth in the early postnatal period and develop obesity, persistent insulin resistance,
and metabolic syndrome in childhood. An analysis of newborns born in Pune, India,
versus those born in London demonstrated that, despite the fact that those born in India
weighed 700 grams less at birth, their insulin levels were markedly elevated. After
adjustment for birth weight, the India-born babies demonstrated increased adiposity,
four times higher insulin, and two times higher leptin levels than their London-born
counterparts.

 Because these babies were already insulin and leptin resistant at birth,
they were predestined to develop obesity and metabolic syndrome.
Worse yet, premature babies also manifest insulin resistance.

 It’s
assumed that
some aspect of prematurity leads to alteration in developmental programming. This is
often compounded by well-meaning pediatricians, who prescribe high-calorie formula
to rapidly increase the baby’s weight gain. The infant is then at enormously high risk for
metabolic syndrome in childhood or in adulthood.
But the converse is also true. Babies born large for gestational age (LGA) also end
up with obesity and metabolic syndrome in later life.

 They’re also hyperinsulinemic
and insulin resistant, but for a different reason. Most babies are LGA due to gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM), a type of diabetes that occurs in approximately 5 percent of
pregnant women. The high blood glucose of the mother leads to high blood glucose of
the fetus, and high insulin levels, which drive fat cells to grow. These GDM babies
have three times the chance for obesity and diabetes in later life. In general, the
“vertical” transmission of diabetes from mother to child has been documented in
studies of the Pima, a Native American tribe in Arizona. Clearly, this is the “gift that
keeps on giving.”
However, GDM isn’t required to produce obesity. LGA babies without GDM also
have double the chance of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Animal studies
show that both fetal undernutrition and overnutrition can change epigenetics, making it
less likely that beta-cells (cells in the pancreas that make insulin) will keep dividing.
LGA children have a limited insulin reserve. As they gain weight over their lives,
diabetes will be the final outcome. But this can be prevented: obese women who
underwent bariatric surgery between their first and second child reduced both the
chance of LGA in the second child and the second child’s future risk for obesity. Fix the
mother, fix the offspring.
Why does this happen? Generally, as the fetal brain develops, the hormone leptin
(coming from the fetal fat cells) tells the hypothalamus to develop normally, defending
against obesity. However, either lack of leptin (as in the undernourished SGA baby) or
insulin antagonism of leptin action (seen in SGA, GDM, LGA, and premature babies)
may prevent normal hypothalamic development and generate a baby whose brain never
gets the right signal. His brain always sees starvation! The infant will eat more and
exercise less right from birth, which will predispose him to obesity in later life,
especially given our current overabundant food supply.

4. Environmental toxins.
 Lastly, there is the possibility that toxins in our
environment are programming increased fetal adipose tissue development. Numerous
compounds in our environment, called obesogens, can act on three molecular switches
to turn on fat cell differentiation. Early fetal exposure may increase the “adipocyte
load,” fostering future obesity, even if the exposure is short-lived (see
chapter 15
).
What these four lines of reasoning tell us is that the major determinant for your
disease risk is the development of your fat cells before you were even born. You had
no say in the matter. This can happen due to problems in the fetal liver (insulin
resistance), fetal brain (leptin signaling), or the developing fat cell itself, increasing
your fat cell number and storage capacity. So does this mean it’s a done deal? Do all
children like Kay need surgery to lose weight? Are we completely powerless to control
our fate? Should you stop reading this book and live on French fries with ice cream
because you are doomed anyway? Not quite.
How Do You Fill a Fat Cell?
So our number of fat cells is predetermined, but what about filling them? This is the
crux of the book and the pivot on which your long-term health can turn. We could easily
put our blinders on and recite the old adage that “fat cells get bigger because we eat too
much and exercise too little.” And, of course, we do. One recent report determined that
increased caloric intake accounts for the entire U.S. obesity epidemic.

 Alternatively,
less energy expenditure, due to increased screen time and decreased physical education
in schools, has been directly correlated with both obesity and the prevalence of
metabolic syndrome in adolescents. Aside from the obvious changes in the caloric and
exercise milieu in which we find ourselves, numerous other processes have been
proffered as examples of environmental change, such as sleep debt, changes in ambient
temperature, and exposure to obesity-causing viruses. Even social networks have been
implicated as causes of obesity.

Would that it were that simple. All these are examples of correlation, not causation.
The journey through obesity and chronic metabolic disease
begins and ends with the
hormone insulin, the energy-storage hormone (see
chapter 4
). There is no fat
accumulation without insulin. Insulin shunts sugar to fat. It makes your fat cells grow.
The more insulin, the more fat, period. While there are many causes of obesity, excess
insulin (known as hyperinsulinemia) in some form is the “final common pathway” for
the overwhelming majority of them. Block it, and the fat cells remain empty.
And we’re all making more insulin than we used to. Today’s adolescents have
double the level of insulin secretion of their predecessors in 1975.

 High insulin is
responsible for perhaps 75–80 percent of all obesity.
There are three different ways to increase your insulin:
1.   If, in response to a meal, particularly one high in refined carbohydrates (see
chapter 10
), your pancreas makes extra insulin (called insulin hypersecretion),
it will drive your fat cells to store energy.

 This happens when your brain
sends a signal to the pancreas through the vagus, or “energy storage,” nerve.
2.   If, because of the specific foods you eat (see
chapters 9
 and

) you build up fat
in your liver, this fat will make the liver sick (called insulin resistance). The
pancreas has no choice but to make more insulin in order to force the liver to do
its job. This raises insulin levels throughout the body, driving energy into fat
cells everywhere, and making other organs sick as well.
3.   If your stress hormone cortisol (which comes from your adrenal gland)
increases, two things will happen. It will work on the liver and muscle to make
them insulin resistant, raising your insulin and driving energy deposition into
fat. It may also work on the brain to make you eat more (see
chapter 6
).
Of course, these three insulin problems are not mutually exclusive. One person
could have more than one problem going on at a time, which makes it even harder to
diagnose and treat.
There’s yet another way that our current society increases insulin and weight gain.
Three classes of medicines (steroids to control inflammation, antipsychotics to stabilize
mood, and oral hypoglycemic agents to treat diabetes) are notorious for driving insulin
up and causing excessive weight
gain. Bottom line, once a glucose molecule is in the
bloodstream it has one of three fates: it can be burned (by exercise), it can be stored in
fat (by insulin), or it can be excreted in the urine (which eventually kills your kidneys).
It’s way better not to need these drugs in the first place—but usually they are the lesser
of two evils.
Can You Get Your Fat Cells to Slim Down?
As you can imagine, these biochemical pathways are pretty darn powerful. Fat cells
want to be downsized about as much as General Motors or AIG. And it doesn’t matter
if you’re young or old—your fat is here to stay. Once the balloon is filled, it doesn’t
want to be deflated. It’s because of insulin that weight loss is so difficult. Virtually
every aspect of our modern society drives our insulin levels higher and higher. From an
evolutionary perspective, our ancestors had to work hard in the face of famine to
accumulate their fat. Their children needed to be prepared for this fate
in utero
 to have
a chance at survival. Once the fat is stored we don’t want to give it up, at least not
without a fight. Because when fat cells get smaller, they stop making leptin. And when
there’s no leptin, there’s no puberty, no pregnancy, no human race. To add insult to
injury, our current drug armamentarium is only minimally effective in promoting fat loss
(see
chapter 19
).
So, how do we slim down a fat cell? What options are left? One promising research
tool is to deprive fat cells of their blood supply. Investigators are actively pursuing the
possibility of using chemicals called angiogenesis inhibitors, which would cut off the
blood supply to fat tissue. Animal experiments using these compounds demonstrate
melting away of the fat tissue. But it will be years before we are ready for trials in
humans. Other compounds are in development, but likewise it will be a long time
before they’re ready to use. In fact, many drug companies have left the obesity research
business, despite the promise of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow (see
chapter

).
So, at least today, there’s only one hope: Reverse the biochemistry. Stop the energy
storage. Fix the leptin resistance. Lowering the insulin works on both counts. But there
are two problems with this strategy:
First, not everyone has the same insulin problem.
So giving general guidelines is not going to work for everybody. We need some version
of “personalized obesity medicine.” Second, changes in the environment are what drive
the biochemistry. If you want to fix the biochemistry, you have to fix the environment.
And that’s not easily done. Parts 5 and 6 will provide some guidance.

The Difference Between “Fat” and “Sick”
July 21, 2009, abcnews.com
“Critics Slam Overweight Surgeon General Pick,
Regina Benjamin” —By Susan Donaldson James
“Dr. Regina M. Benjamin, Obama’s pick for the next surgeon general,
was hailed as a MacArthur Grant genius who had championed the poor
at a medical clinic she set up in Katrina-ravaged Alabama. But the full-
figured African-American nominee is also under fire for being
overweight in a nation where 34 percent of all Americans aged 20 and
over are obese.
Even some of the most reputable names in medicine chimed in. ‘I
think it is an issue…’ said Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor of the
New
England Journal of Medicine
…‘It tends to undermine her credibility…
at a time when a lot of public health concern is about the national
epidemic of obesity, having a surgeon general who is noticeably
overweight raises questions in people’s minds.’”
ven Dr. Angell, an intelligent woman by any definition, doesn’t get it. Do you think
Dr. Benjamin chose to be obese? Do you think she’s a glutton and a sloth given her
talents, character, and track record? Is she overweight? Sure. Is she sick? Don’t bet on
it.
Most people in the modern world do not want to be thought of as obese. Here’s a
politically incorrect disclosure: my pediatric colleagues and I see Latino mothers who
come to clinic with infants whose weights top the charts
and tip the scales. And these
women are worried, but in the opposite direction. “
No come
” (Spanish for “He doesn’t
eat”), they moan. There is a racial/ethnic overlay to obesity. This is in part due to
societal norms and what’s expected for your culture. For instance, some extremely poor
countries have developed a set of cultural norms that equate obesity with affluence and
desirability. Fatty foods, such as meat and dairy, were scarce in their native countries,
and pitifully available only to the wealthy. Upon moving to America, immigrants from
developing countries are suddenly immersed in a glut of rich energy-dense foods, and
they overindulge as their insulin increases. Sometimes these cultural views persist
throughout generations. The immigrants view their obese children as the epitome of
health and an affirmation of their ability to provide for them. In their countries of origin,
thin children were sickly and at risk of premature death. Unfortunately, they aren’t yet
familiar with the fact that the opposite is true in America.
More political incorrectness: some teenage African American girls tip the scales at
300 pounds, but when you ask them if they think they’re obese, many will say, no, that
they’re “thick” (which describes a girl who isn’t fat or skinny, but is well proportioned,
and has meat on her bones and in all the right places). Many DJs still play Sir Mix A
Lot’s song, “Baby Got Back,” “I like big butts and I cannot lie….” (Those of you with
young children and not hip with modern tuneage may instead recognize this song as sung
by the character Donkey in
Shrek
.) Then again, it’s long been known that, when polled,
women consistently underestimate their weight. (Don’t worry ladies, you’re not alone
in the exaggeration department; men consistently overestimate their height and other
lengths as well.) Clearly obesity, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.
There seems to be a genetic component to this as well. Several studies have looked
at how much fat must be present before signs of illness develop. And the results are
striking, if not surprising. Caucasians start showing metabolic wear and tear at a BMI
of around 30, which is why epidemiologists chose 30 as the obesity breakpoint.
However, African Americans don’t show metabolic decompensation until a BMI of
about 35, while Asians start to manifest disease at a BMI of around 25.

 On average, an
African American woman can carry an extra 27 pounds over an Asian female (half of
which is fat, half muscle), before she can expect some kind of negative impact from that
extra weight.
Many of my patients will say to me, “As long as I feel all right, my weight’s not a
problem.” They may very well be right. But for how long? Which brings us to an
important precept about body weight. Whenever we step on the scale, we are measuring
the sum of four different body compartments, only one of which is bad for us.
1.
Bone.
 The more bone, the longer you live. When little old ladies fracture their
hips, that’s their swan song. African Americans, to their benefit, have a greater bone
density than do other races.
2.
Muscle
. More muscle is better for your health. Muscle takes up glucose. More
exercise means more muscle, and more muscle means better insulin sensitivity. Arnold
Schwarzenegger in his weightlifting days (anabolic steroids or not) had a BMI of 32,
not because he was obese but because he was all muscle and had very little fat. When
you’re building bone and muscle, you are providing a method for burning energy rather
than storing it, which leads to improving your health regardless of your weight.
3.
Subcutaneous (or “big butt”) fat
. This makes up about 80 percent of our total
body fat and is what gave Marilyn Monroe her hourglass figure. Believe it or not, more
subcutaneous fat is better for your health. Several studies show that the size of the
subcutaneous fat depot correlates with longevity. Little old ladies who don’t have much
subcutaneous fat get sicker and die sooner, and not just from their hip fractures.
4.
Visceral fat
. The only compartment that is consistently bad for us is our visceral
(aka abdominal, ectopic, or “big belly”) fat. This consists of fat in areas where it
doesn’t belong, including fat inside your abdomen and inside your organs (e.g., liver
and muscle). It makes up about 20 percent of our total body fat, or about 4–6 percent of
our total body weight. Visceral fat is the fulcrum on which your health teeters.
The Scale Lies Even More Than You Do
Not all pounds are created equal. The scale lies—you were right all along!—at least in
terms of your health and your lifespan. In fact, the
majority of Americans now have a
BMI of over 25, which puts them in the overweight category. Studies show that, on
average, people with a BMI of 25–30 have the longest lifespan.

 So being overweight
is good? Yes, all you Kate Moss wannabees—provided the weight is in the right place.
Do you ever wish that all the fat on your body would somehow miraculously
disappear? That some talented plastic surgeon could painlessly remove every cubic
centimeter of unwanted adipose? For free and with no lasting scars or cellulite? Come
on, admit it. It’s a recurrent dream of virtually everyone on the planet. Even men.
Think again. What would life be like without any fat? Pretty damn miserable, and
short to boot. Indeed, some unfortunate souls get to experience this firsthand. It’s called
lipodystrophy and it’s one of the worst diseases known to humankind.

 It can be genetic
or acquired as a complication of AIDS therapy. With it, you look weird, gaunt, and as if
you’re circling the grave, which you are. When your body wants to store energy, there’s
no place for it to go. So it goes to the only places it can—your liver, muscles, and
blood vessels. The organs of people with lipodystrophy get filled with fat and they
develop diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and heart disease.
Bottom line, you need your fat. At least you need your subcutaneous or “big butt”
fat, which provides a bucket for extra energy to keep you alive and healthy. With rare
exceptions, your subcutaneous fat contributes very little to the development of chronic
disease. Twenty percent of morbidly obese adults have completely normal metabolic
status, no evidence of disease, and normal longevity. In fact, the smaller your
subcutaneous fat compartment, the faster you die.
When it comes right down to it, it’s all about your middle. This whole
obesity/health/longevity question centers on your abdominal, visceral, or “big belly” fat
—at least statistically. All this hoopla about one body compartment, which constitutes
only 4–6 percent of your total weight. But it translates into the difference of about
fifteen years of life.

 Here, size really does matter; it means dying in your fifties of a
heart attack or cancer versus living into your eighties or longer. Visceral fat depots are
more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat depots, and they drive inflammation.
Visceral fat causes insulin resistance, which in turn promotes
diabetes, cancer,
cardiovascular disease, dementia, and aging. While the populace is more worried about
subcutaneous fat (because it’s unsightly), this fat is much less prone to being lost; in
fact, it is rarely shed unless you go on a caloric restriction or starvation diet, which is
rarely sustainable.
It’s the visceral fat that doctors care about, because it’s the visceral fat that kills
you. When you lose weight on any diet, it’s the visceral fat that is lost first. It’s there for
easy access for energy (see
chapter 6
), so it’s the first to go. And that’s good. But your
body defends its subcutaneous fat, because that’s the fat that makes leptin, and your
body (your brain) knows it’s good for you. And it’s even more specific than that. Your
visceral fat is really just a proxy for your “ectopic,” or intra-organ, fat—the fat in your
liver and muscles. This is the real killer. But it is too hard to measure without very
specialized imaging techniques such as MRI or liver ultrasound. Chronic metabolic
disease starts when fat deposits itself in organs such as muscles and especially the
liver.
This fact is borne out in a recent study comparing BMI to percentage body fat by X-
ray methods. It appears that many as 50 percent of women and 20 percent of men who
are categorized as normal on the basis of their BMI are actually obese based on their
carriage of visceral (bad) fat.

 The study’s author, Dr. Eric Braverman, called BMI the
“Baloney-Mass Index,” because it gives a false sense of security to those who follow
it. Indeed, Dr. Jimmy Bell of London, using MRI scans of the abdomen, realized that
body size is irrelevant; it’s visceral fat that drives disease. He coined the expression
“thin on the outside, fat on the inside,” or TOFI.

 Bottom line, it’s your visceral fat, in
particular your liver fat, that counts.
How Do You Measure Visceral Fat?
Standing on a scale is great for determining your wrestling weight class, but it is
woefully inadequate for just about any other purpose. It is particularly useless for
discerning how healthy you are or whether you are at risk for metabolic disease and/or
death. BMI is problematic because, as a measurement, it can’t distinguish between the
four body compartments of bone, muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. Doctors
use BMI anyway
because it works at a population level, but not necessarily for their
individual patients. The reason is that, excluding African Americans (like Dr.
Benjamin), who get five extra BMI points for free, and the 20 percent of obese subjects
who are metabolically normal, if your BMI is over 30 you likely have a significant
visceral fat component and some level of metabolic dysfunction.
Still, we need a better measure than BMI of where your body fat is located, how
much, and what it means. The simplest and cheapest surrogate for determining your
health status is your waist circumference, which correlates with morbidity and risk for
death better than any other health parameter.

 This is arguably the most important piece
of information in your entire health profile because it tells you about your visceral fat.
A high waist circumference translates into the “apple” shape that tips physicians off to
risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. But physicians are loath to measure
this in the office because you need a metal tape measure, the measurement is subject to
error, different people do it differently (the two sanctioned methods use completely
different body landmarks), it takes time and effort, and it means getting “up close and
personal” with the patient. Furthermore, the doctor often doesn’t know what to do with
the results except say, “You should really eat less and exercise more.”
A reasonable proxy is belt size. Greater than 40 inches for males and 35 inches for
females is a likely indicator of visceral fat, which is correlated with insulin resistance
and risk for metabolic disease in adults

 and in children.

 But you can imagine that
people who wear their pants way below their beer belly might get the measurement
wrong. As long as you have someone to help you, you might also try to measure your
hip circumference. A waist-to-hip ratio of greater than 0.85 (in women) or 1.0 (in men)
is another warning sign of insulin resistance, versus a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.8 or less,
which suggests metabolic normalcy. Waist circumference is more complicated to
measure and determine in children because it is dependent on sex, age, and race. While
standards have been published, none of the childhood obesity guidelines from any of the
medical societies currently advocate using waist circumference as a screen for
metabolic disease.
Another simple method for determining your metabolic status is to look at the back
of your neck, armpits, and knuckles. What you’re looking
for is acanthosis nigricans, or
a darkening, thickening, and ridging of the skin. Many people think this is dirt or, in the
case of the neck, “ring around the collar,” but it’s actually excess insulin working on the
skin (the epidermal growth factor receptor, to be exact). You might also see skin tags in
these areas. Both of these are visible signs of insulin resistance and predict future risk
for chronic metabolic disease. Every other method to find out your metabolic risk is
expensive and requires blood drawing, specialized equipment, and professional data
analysis.
Weight Loss Is the Wrong Approach and the Wrong
Outcome
Any doctor will tell you that losing weight will improve your health, including me. And
it’s a fact—except for two small problems: First, weight loss is next to impossible.
Witness all the money wasted on weight-loss aids. And second, it’s only half-true.
(See, even I lie!) When you go on a diet to lose weight, what are you losing? You lose
some fat, but you’re actually losing more muscle, unless you exercise while you’re
dieting in order to prevent the muscle loss. Remember, muscle is good for you. Even if
you lost subcutaneous fat easily, it wouldn’t help your health. A group of obese women
were studied before and after liposuction, which vacuums out subcutaneous fat only.
Their metabolic status didn’t improve despite an average 20-pound weight loss.

 So
aside from not being easy, losing weight is a bit of a crapshoot in terms of
effectiveness.
And here’s the catch-22 of weight loss: thanks to the DEXA scan (an X-ray method
of determining body composition), we know that when you lose subcutaneous fat (the
fat underneath the skin) by dieting, you also lose an equal amount of muscle. Your
percentage of fat stays the same. A decidedly good-news, bad-news deal.
So what should your doctor be telling you? No question, if you’re obese and you
want to improve your health, you want to lose some fat. But the fat you want to lose is
the visceral, or the ectopic (intra-organ, as in liver) fat. If you lose subcutaneous fat,
too, that’s a bonus. Your doctor will tell you that losing even 5 percent of your body
weight will be beneficial, which is true. Because that 5 percent is likely going to come
from
your visceral/ectopic/metabolically active fat. If you are obese, the National
Institutes of Health recommends losing 7–10 percent of your body weight to reduce
your risk of life-threatening illness.

 I agree; just make it your visceral fat—that’s the
key to improving your individual health outcomes. Watch your waist circumference. If
your pants fit better, then you are healthier. But if you think you’re going to be able to
lose that big butt with any rational diet, think again. You might be able to do so—for a
short time. But as you lose subcutaneous fat, and your leptin levels fall, your brain will
sense starvation, and reduce the activity of your sympathetic nervous system (see
chapter 4
), reduce your energy expenditure, make you feel lousy, and activate your
vagus nerve. Viva Las Vagus! That darn vagus will drive up your appetite, your insulin,
and energy storage to replace what you lost. And you’re going to regain the visceral fat
first. Screwed yet again.
So how can anyone do it? What’s rational? What’s effective? What strategy will
improve your health? If I didn’t think this could be accomplished, I wouldn’t have
bothered writing this book. The short answer is that it depends on how you got there in
the first place. Because obesity isn’t one disease; it’s many. This isn’t a one-size-fits-
all deal. Like anything in medicine, different problems require different approaches. As
you saw in
chapters 4
–

, there are three reasons to eat—two insulin problems and one
cortisol problem—and they all have different solutions. These solutions will be
discussed in detail in
chapters 17
–

. The short answer is that to get your visceral fat
down, you don’t necessarily need to lose weight. But you will have to do something
different.

Metabolic Syndrome: The New Scourge
Diana is an eight-year-old Latino girl who weighs 200 pounds. Despite
not yet starting puberty, she has already been diagnosed with type 2
diabetes. For the past two years, she and her mother have lived in a
homeless shelter. The child constantly cries for food despite being given
ample portions. To feel that she can provide for her daughter, her mother
also gives Diana her own portion of every meal served by the shelter.
Worse yet, Diana gets a third breakfast at the school as part of the
USDA School Nutrition Program. While Diana’s mother does what she
feels is in the best interest of her daughter, she is inadvertently making
her sicker and likely contributing to an early death.
he numbers don’t lie: the fatter you are, the quicker you die. At least at a population
level. An actuarial analysis in 2003 demonstrated that those with a BMI of 45 lost a
total of twenty years of life.

 As a rule, the fat die young. Ford now makes cars
specifically suited for the obese in America, and we’ve even super-sized our caskets.
But we’re talking statistics for large populations of people here. At an individual level,
all bets are off. Twenty percent of the obese population have a normal metabolic
profile, whereas up to 40 percent of normal-weight people have an abnormal metabolic
profile. Knowing where you stand is crucial to taking steps to prolong your life.
Metabolic Syndrome
You don’t die of obesity; you die of the diseases that “travel” with it. It’s these
metabolic decompensations that make obesity the scourge that it is. Diabetes,
hypertension, heart disease, cancer, and dementia—the things that kill you are
collectively packaged under the concept of “metabolic syndrome.”
Metabolic syndrome is classically defined by the National Cholesterol Education
Program’s Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP) as a cluster of five chronic conditions
(obesity, diabetes, lipid problems such as high triglyceride and low HDL, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease), any or all of which increase your chance of early death. The
NCEP states that if you’ve got three of the five, you’ve got metabolic syndrome.
However, the syndrome is not nearly so easy to define. Other professional
organizations have chosen to define it using slightly different criteria.

 The reason for
these alternate diagnostic benchmarks is that we really don’t know the true cause. All
the benchmarks try to establish cutoffs, which are fraught with error. Establishing
criteria for metabolic syndrome in children is even more difficult.

 But it’s crucial,
because the problem is increasing at alarming rates and translates into fifteen to twenty
years of life lost. Metabolic syndrome may soon overtake smoking as the leading cause
of heart disease worldwide.
The concept that cardiometabolic risk factors “cluster” in certain individuals has
been known for several decades. However, it was not until the early 1980s that the
relationship between obesity, dyslipidemia (an abnormal amount of cholesterol and/or
fat in the blood), and hypertension was recognized. Only then did the roles of insulin
resistance and abdominal obesity become apparent. But metabolic syndrome should be
considered a spectrum of diseases. And not all the diseases hit each person; it tends to
be “mix and match.”
Racial/Ethnic/Sex Differences in Metabolic Syndrome
Males with metabolic syndrome are seven times more likely than females with
metabolic syndrome to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Race is one of
the biggest determinants of what diseases you are susceptible
to. For example, blacks
do not get the hypertriglyceridemia (high levels of triglycerides in the blood; see
chapter 10
) that Caucasians do, but they tend to have higher blood pressure levels
independent of body weight. Hence, despite having higher rates of diabetes and
cardiovascular disease, blacks are diagnosed with metabolic syndrome less frequently.
Conversely, Latinos have an increased prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, but they
have less hypertension. Hispanic males are approximately seven times more likely to
have the diagnosis than non-Hispanic males. Blacks and Latinos also appear to be more
insulin resistant than Caucasians. All these data reinforce the fact that racial/ethnic/sex
differences in metabolic syndrome and its components make it very hard to use hard-
and-fast cutoffs for its diagnosis.
How Insulin Resistance Becomes Metabolic Syndrome
You don’t have to be obese to have metabolic syndrome. After all, up to 40 percent of
normal-weight adults have it! Obesity is a “marker” for metabolic syndrome, but not the
only marker; it is not the cause. Whether it resides in fat people or not, the one thing
everyone seems to agree on is that insulin resistance is the hallmark of metabolic
syndrome. And thin people can be insulin resistant, too. But how? And where? And
why does the body become insulin resistant? Here is one postulated scheme by which
metabolic syndrome occurs

:
1.   Metabolic syndrome starts as your body accumulates energy, storing it in the
liver and in visceral fat tissue. This makes the liver insulin resistant, which
starts metabolic dysfunction—a detrimental cascade of effects that damages
every organ in the body.
2.   Liver insulin resistance causes the liver to transport energy improperly. The
pancreas responds by increasing insulin release to make the liver do its job.
This drives insulin levels even higher (hyperinsulinemia), which causes further
energy deposition into subcutaneous fat tissue and causes the persistent weight
gain that drives obesity.
3.   The liver tries to export the excess fat as triglycerides, to be stored in the
subcutaneous fat tissue. The blood lipids rise to drive dyslipidemia (see
chapter

), one of the risk factors for heart disease.
4.   The high insulin acts on blood vessels, causing the smooth muscle cells that
surround each blood vessel to grow more rapidly than normal. This process
tightens the artery walls and promotes high blood pressure.
5.   The combination of insulin resistance, lipid problems, and high blood pressure
wreaks havoc throughout the body. This promotes cardiovascular disease,
which can result in heart attack or stroke.
6.   The fat in the liver causes inflammation, which drives further insulin resistance.
Eventually the liver can scar, which results in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(see
chapters 11
 and

). This can later progress to cirrhosis.
7.   Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in women can drive the ovary to make
extra testosterone and reduce estrogen, resulting in polycystic ovarian
syndrome, hirsutism (excess body hair), and infertility.
8.   As the liver insulin resistance gets worse and the body fat grows, the pancreas
has to make more insulin. Eventually the pancreatic beta-cells can’t keep up
with the body’s requirements, which leads to a relative insulin deficiency.
Eventually the beta-cells fail, precipitating type 2 diabetes.
9.   Insulin is one of the hormones that cause cells to divide. Hyperinsulinemia is
associated with the development and growth of various forms of cancer.
10.   There is early evidence, although by no means proven, that insulin resistance
in the brain leads to dementia.
Basically, the various diseases of metabolic syndrome are where virtually all our
health care dollars are going. So understanding these disease processes is essential for
making any headway in our current health care debacle.
The First Hit: The Liver Dilemma
Under normal circumstances, approximately 20 percent of your caloric intake goes to
the liver. The liver uses that energy for three tasks. First, it burns some of it for its own
metabolism and livelihood. Second, when the energy source is glucose (the major
energy source of all living things, and the building block of complex carbohydrates), the
liver turns the excess glucose into glycogen (liver starch), stimulated by the hormone
insulin. Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in the liver. Glycogen isn’t dangerous;
it provides us with a ready supply of glucose should we need it. Third, the liver has to
deal with excess energy, which may arrive in several forms: as fatty acids from
digestion of dietary fat or as amino acids from the digestion of protein, the consumption
of alcohol, or from the molecule fructose (which is half sucrose, or table sugar, and
roughly half high-fructose corn syrup). This extra energy is processed by the liver into
fat. The liver needs to transport this fat out, or it will muck up the works. If it can’t, the
liver can get very sick, very fast. Bottom line: in the liver, glycogen is good, fat is bad.
And anything that drives liver fat accumulation, even in children such as Diana, is a
potential driver of metabolic disease (see
chapters 10
 and

).
The Second Hit: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Disease
Okay, that’s one problem. What else drives metabolic dysfunction? And in so many
tissues? Glucose is the preferred energy source of all organisms on the planet. If you
don’t consume glucose, your liver will make it out of what’s available. Glucose
metabolism occurs through two distinct pathways. The first is called glycolysis, which
converts glucose into the energy intermediate pyruvate, liberating a small amount of
energy. The second step is called the Krebs cycle. It occurs within the mitochondria
(the cell’s equivalent of a coal furnace), and burns the pyruvate down to carbon dioxide
and water, liberating a lot of energy in the process. About 80 percent of energy intake
will be metabolized in this way. When your body burns energy, some toxic metabolites
(breakdown products of a reaction) get manufactured within the mitochondria; these are
called reactive oxygen species (ROS). They are the body’s equivalent of hydrogen
peroxide. In some parts
of the body, ROS are put to good use. For instance, when found
within your white blood cells, ROS are part of your body’s immune defense system to
kill foreign invaders so you don’t get infected.
But ROS are also by-products of normal energy metabolism. When they are made in
other types of cells, such as those of the liver or pancreas, they can do damage to the
cells’ DNA, proteins, or membranes. ROS require the help of antioxidants to quench
them before they have a chance to do damage. That is the function of another part of the
cell, called the peroxisome, which is full of antioxidants. Most of these come from the
foods you eat in the form of micronutrients (see
chapter 14
). Peroxisomes live right next
to mitochondria, and act as the “mop-up crew” for excess ROS. When the peroxisomes
can keep up with the ROS generated inside the cell, you and your cells stay healthy.
When they can’t, the cell either is damaged or dies. These two hits together cause the
cell to crap out, and when enough cells give up, you’ve got the basis for metabolic
syndrome.

The Four Foodstuffs of the Apocalypse
Many investigators have spent considerable resources searching for the gene or genes
that cause metabolic syndrome. As with obesity, the genetic analyses have thus far been
unrevealing. In fact, it has been suggested that only about 10 percent of metabolic
syndrome can be explained by genetics.

 This leaves approximately 90 percent to
changes in the environment, specifically the quality and quantity of our food intake, and
how these promote liver insulin resistance.

When the energy bolus comes as glucose (starch), the liver has several safety
mechanisms, including letting the other organs deal with it (spread the pain), and
conversion to glycogen, keeping the liver safe. But when the liver has to deal with
foodstuffs that can’t be metabolized by other organs, the result is the excess production
of ROS and liver fat, which gets transported out as triglycerides (blood fats) (see
chapter 11
). When energy supplies overwhelm the mitochondria’s ability to handle
them, the result is a buildup of ROS and fat deposition in the liver (“mitochondrial
constipation,” if you will), leading to chronic metabolic disease. These foodstuffs
tend
to affect different age groups based on their frequency in the American diet. What
foodstuffs have this unique signature to cause this metabolic disturbance? There are
four, by my count.
1.
Trans fats.
 These can’t be broken down by the mitochondria because of their
synthetic nature.

 Trans fats have long been assumed to contribute to chronic metabolic
disease, especially atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Trans fats used to be in
every processed food, although slowly they are leaving our diet. But they are still in
baked goods and candy bars. In fact, any food in a wrapper at room temperature that’s
meant to sit on a store shelf is suspect. The FDA and the food industry have since
recognized the problem that trans fats pose, and while there is no nationwide ban on
them, there is currently a concerted effort to remove them from our diet. For instance,
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has banned the use of trans fats within restaurants in New
York City. Yet, despite the cutback on trans fats, the rates of obesity and diabetes
continue to rise.
2.
Branched-chain amino acids
. These are essential amino acids, meaning our
bodies cannot make them so they must be eaten in our diet. Blood levels of branched-
chain amino acids are directly related to consumption. These amino acids are in high
concentration in corn, so every animal fed on corn (e.g., U.S. beef and pork) is a
potential contributor to your total body load. While these amino acids are necessary for
building proteins all around the body, any in excess are burned for energy in the liver.
Body builders consume these with abandon in their protein powders, and as long as
these people are building their bodies, no problem. For everyone else, however, big
problem. When branched-chain amino acids are metabolized for energy, they bypass
glycogen in the liver and go straight to the mitochondria for burning, or to be turned into
fat (see
chapter 10
). Christopher Newgard at Duke University has demonstrated that
patients with metabolic syndrome exhibit higher levels of these amino acids in the
bloodstream.

 But at this point, we only have correlation, not causation.
3.
Alcohol.
 Alcohol is interesting because a small daily ration, especially when
consumed as wine, has been shown to
prevent
 metabolic syndrome. (If you have high
cholesterol, your doctor may recommend a glass
or two of red wine with dinner.)

 But
increased consumption of booze clearly contributes to metabolic syndrome’s
development. Furthermore, alcoholic beverages that also contain glucose, such as beer
and shochu (a Japanese fermented drink) have been clearly implicated in the promotion
of metabolic syndrome in America and Japan, respectively.

 Alcohol also goes to the
mitochondria without stopping at glycogen. However, alcohol certainly does not
explain how children get metabolic syndrome or why metabolic syndrome is rampant in
alcohol-abstaining Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.
4.
Fructose
. Finally, we come to the Voldemort of the dietary hit list: the sweet
molecule in sugar. If it’s sweet, and it’s caloric, it’s fructose. Period. This is the one
foodstuff whose consumption has increased worldwide, and with reckless abandon.
And it is the one that children eat with no holds barred. We have animal and human
data. We also have the golden ticket: correlation
and
 causation. Every age group,
including infants, has increased its consumption of fructose in the last thirty years. As
far as I am concerned, this is where the action is, and will be fully elaborated in
chapter 11
.
Can’t We Just Pop a Pill?
In a word, no. There’s no drug target to stop this process, because ROS formation is a
fact of life. We’ve got medicines that can treat the various downstream outcomes. We
have statins and fibrates for lipid problems; antihypertensives to reduce blood
pressure; insulin and other hypoglycemic agents to treat diabetes; loads of drugs to
make the heart beat better and stronger; vitamin E and metformin for fatty liver; dialysis
and transplantation for chronic kidney disease; various chemotherapies once you get
cancer; and even new Alzheimer’s drugs. But your mitochondria are still screwed. And
the lipogenesis and ROS damage will continue unabated. Your cells will die, and so
will you. But you and Diana aren’t doomed. You can slow the process down
considerably.
The easiest and most rational approaches to reducing ROS formation and toxicity
are preventive. You can: limit specific substrate
availability (modify your diet; see
chapters 11
,

,

); reduce the rate at which the liver metabolizes energy (eat more
fiber; see
chapter 12
); increase your antioxidant capacity (consume micronutrients; see
chapter 14
); and/or increase mitochondrial formation and number to improve
mitochondrial capacity and efficiency (exercise; see
chapter 13
). We’re talking altered
intake and expenditure. If you’ve overindulged your entire life, and you want to get on
the bandwagon now, all is not lost. Studies of patients with diabetes who improve their
lifestyle (e.g., eat properly and exercise) demonstrate reduction in total body burden of
ROS, improved health, and increased longevity.

Oh no! Diet and exercise again! Is this whole book just a crock? Why did I spend
good money for the same message? Didn’t I already know this? No, because it’s not just
“eat less, exercise more.” We’re talking about something specific. Because
a calorie is
not a calorie.

The “Real” Toxic Environment
Chapter 10
The Omnivore’s Curse:
Low Fat versus Low Carb
Sally is a beautiful thirteen-year-old girl, but since the age of eleven she
had been gaining 20 pounds per year. She has the lead in her middle
school musical and is mortified because she can’t fit into her costume.
She comes to my clinic after her family’s attempts at lifestyle
intervention are ineffective. An oral glucose tolerance test shows that
her pancreas releases too much insulin (see
chapter 19
), yet she is also
insulin resistant and glucose intolerant. We place her on a low-carb diet
and prescribe metformin (see
chapter 19
) to lower her insulin. She loses
20 pounds in the first three months, another 10 pounds after that, and
holds steady thereafter. She isn’t abnormally hungry anymore, and her
insulin levels have returned to normal. She is a very happy camper.
The “Hunters”
In the beginning there were the hunters. Most hunters killed their food, while some
fished. They ate fat and protein, went long stretches between kills, and had to live off
their fat stores. Their livers processed dietary fat in one of two ways based on the
hunters’ body weight and their current energy supply. If energy was in short supply, the
liver would chop up the fatty
acids (long carbon chains) systematically into 2-carbon
fragments called acetyl-CoA, or ketones. These fragments could then be burned for
energy either by the mitochondria (the portion of the cell where energy generation
occurs), in the liver, or in other organs. If the energy supply was in excess, the liver
would package the fat into particles known as low-density lipoproteins (LDL). These
LDL particles would circulate in the bloodstream and eventually take up residence in
fat cells to be stored as triglyceride (blobs of fat) for another day, when energy might
be needed when food was scarce. In the absence of insulin (as would occur in
starvation), this stored triglyceride would break down into free fatty acids. The cycle
would then repeat itself—the stored triglyceride would be released into the
bloodstream, reenter the liver, and be chopped up into 2-carbon fragments to make
acetyl-CoA, or ketones, again. These hunters didn’t know what a carbohydrate was and
they didn’t need to, as animal (and human) carcasses were devoid of carbohydrates.
Our bodies were, and are, perfectly adapted to burning fat as an energy source.
This is the nature of what has become known as the low-carb diet. Natural
examples of this can still be found in cultures around the world, such as the Maasai and
Samburu tribes of north-central Kenya (who eat meat, milk, and animal blood) and the
Inuit of the Arctic (who eat fish, meat, and whale fat). In the early 1900s, the Arctic
explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson (1879–1962) lived among the Inuit for several years,
subsisted primarily on whale blubber, and never felt healthier. He was the first to note
that the Inuit, who ate nary a carbohydrate, had an extraordinarily low incidence of
cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. (This has unfortunately
changed in recent years with the introduction of processed foods into their diet.) When
he returned to the United States in the late 1920s, Stefansson undertook an experiment.
Under medical supervision, he ate only meat for one year and was documented to have
no negative health effects from his diet. Stefansson wrote the 1960 book
Cancer:
Disease of Civilization?
 about his experiences and observations.
The low-carb diet has achieved mythic status. In the 1970s, Dr. Robert Atkins
transformed it into high art—cheeseburgers without the bun, bacon and eggs, and
broccoli with cheese sauce. No toast or potatoes, and woe to the beer drinkers. It
continues to recruit record numbers of followers,
who swear by it for treatment of
obesity and promotion of health. The low-carb movement hit its peak in 2002, with the
publication of two
New England Journal of Medicine
 articles demonstrating its
utility.

 Die-hards still swear by it, mainstream obesity experts have gotten on the
bandwagon, and the number of positive testimonials can be documented with one click
of your mouse. But in the recent past, the low-carb diet has come under fire, as it is
very difficult to stay on it in America. It has also been criticized for having potential
negative health impacts.

The “Gatherers”
Alongside the hunters, there were the gatherers. The gatherers found their food in what
came out of the ground. They ate carbohydrates and proteins in the form of fruits and
vegetables. If energy was in short supply, the glucose would be completely taken up by
the liver. If the gatherers’ energy status was instead replete, the liver would not capture
some of the glucose and a rise in the blood glucose and subsequent insulin release
would occur. If energy was in great surplus, then the blood glucose would rise even
higher and insulin would keep pace, driving energy into fat for storage for a rainy day
(e.g., famine).
This is the basis for today’s vegan diet. It is practiced in multiple cultures around
the globe, because if you grow your own food, that’s what’s available. Many people in
the United States eat this way as a matter of choice and sometimes to an extreme. (For
example, fruitarians eat only fruits, nuts, and seeds, and some fruitarians eat only that
which has naturally fallen from the tree, to avoid hurting the plant.) This diet can also
be perfectly healthy and, when practiced properly, lifesaving.

The Omnivore’s Curse
The conflict between these two dietary philosophies is touched on in Michael Pollan’s
2006 book
The Omnivore’s Dilemma.
 Evolutionarily, the metabolism of fat and
carbohydrates developed separately. The net
energy recoupment of each of these
processes is minimal. But both metabolic products of these two completely different
pathways (fat being broken down serially versus carbohydrates undergoing glycolosis)
meet at the mitochondria in the form of the compound acetyl-CoA. As we learned in
chapter 9
, how much acetyl-CoA the mitochondria have to process has
everything
 to do
with how healthy the cell is. It also determines whether the cell will collapse under the
weight of processing all that energy.
The hunters ate fat; the liver would beta-oxidize (the process by which fatty acids
are broken down by the mitochondria, two carbons at a time) what it needed for its use
and would then export any excess LDL to be taken up in adipose tissue. The gatherers
ate carbohydrates (glucose); after absorption, the liver would extract what it needed
and the insulin would clear the rest out into the bloodstream for muscle and adipose
tissue. In the liver, any excess glucose would be converted to glycogen for storage. Our
ancestors were rarely exclusively hunters
or
 gatherers, but they likely favored one food
type (fat or carbohydrate) over the other depending on where they lived and the time of
year. The liver thus developed two separate pop-off valves to protect it from excess
energy, one for carbohydrate and one for fat. In both cases, the mitochondria’s exposure
to acetyl-CoA was exquisitely regulated so as not to overwhelm their capacity. The
mitochondria never had to bite off more than they could chew.
But then, as humans learned to irrigate and farm, we became omnivores. Sally, and
with few exceptions, our entire society, eat fat and carbohydrates at the same meal
(e.g., steak and potatoes). As food became more plentiful, we began to overload both
sides of our metabolic pathways: the 2-carbon breakdown of fat
and
 the glycolysis of
carbohydrates. Now the mitochondria are catching hell; they have to deal with an
onslaught of acetyl-CoA coming from both directions. One high-fat, high-carbohydrate
meal is no big deal. But keep this up for ten thousand meals in a row (about ten years;
just in time for your teenage years) and we’re talking about some real damage: an
increase in chronic metabolic disease or metabolic syndrome.
Fat
or
 Carbohydrate? Or Fat
and
 Carbohydrate?
Here’s some food for thought. With very few exceptions, every naturally occurring
foodstuff contains either fat
or
 carbohydrates, but usually not both. Meat, fish, and
poultry have no carbohydrates. Grains, roots, and tubers (e.g., potatoes and yams) have
no fat. Those fruits that have fat, such as avocados, olives, and coconut, have minimal
carbohydrates. Nuts are an exception, but they are still pretty low in carbohydrates and
very high in fiber. (That’s why they’re brown; see
chapter 12
.) Milk is another
exception to the rule, but other than that which came from their mothers, humans were
not exposed to other mammals’ milk until the beginnings of agriculture, in the Neolithic
period. They didn’t have a USDA Food Pyramid to follow.
It wasn’t until we became
gourmets
, eating fat and carbohydrates in the same meal,
that our cells first felt the wrath of mitochondrial wear and tear. This accounts for the
appearance of metabolic disease with the advent of trade in the early seventeenth
century; before that, food was still a function of what you killed or you grew yourself.
Eventually, we became
gourmands
, eating fat and carbohydrate in the same food. This
is the essence—the blessing and the curse—of processed food. Except for one big item,
which has both fat and carbohydrates at the same time. (I’ll give you a hint: it’s really
sweet.)
The Battle Royale
The prevalence of heart disease had begun to rise slowly over the early twentieth
century when Paul Dudley White wrote his classic treatise
Heart Disease
 in 1931.
White was Eisenhower’s cardiologist in 1955 after the president’s heart attack. The
move to reduce heart disease through dietary intervention was in full swing by the
1960s, with the U.S. government wanting to take a proactive role. This set the stage for
a nutritional “holy war,” played out in kitchens and restaurants across America. The
goal was to alter our diet for the better. Instead, we’ve laid waste to every nutritional
hypothesis, lost the public’s trust, and killed countless millions in the
process. We will
be suffering the aftermath of this Battle Royale for generations to come.
The first salvo in the battle emanated from the dental community. Prior to 1960, the
known problems associated with sugar were restricted to the development of cavities.

With the advent of water fluoridation in 1945, cavities were no longer a public health
issue. Sugar dropped from the radar.
Enter John Yudkin and Ancel Keys. Yudkin, a British physiologist and nutritionist,
researched the nature of chronic disease. In 1957 he postulated that dietary composition
was the cornerstone of coronary thrombosis (heart attacks). By 1964 he had determined
through natural observation that the consumption of sucrose was most closely
associated with heart disease. He was the first to show that sugar uniquely raised serum
(blood) triglycerides and insulin levels. In 1972 he published his seminal work on the
subject,
Pure, White, and Deadly,
 in the United Kingdom. Yudkin published countless
papers on the biochemistry of sucrose, specifically the molecule called fructose, which
gives sugar its sweetness. He was the first to warn that excessive consumption could
lead to coronary heart disease, diabetes, GI disease, eye disease, and other
inflammatory diseases.
Ancel Keys, a Minnesota epidemiologist, was already in the public eye as the
inventor of the K-ration during World War II. In 1952 he took a sabbatical in England,
where he saw enormous increases in heart disease in the face of the English diet, which
consisted of incredibly high fat and high cholesterol items. (Think bangers and mash,
fish and chips.) He noted that those who were the best fed in both the United States and
the United Kingdom, those able to afford meat, were the ones who suffered most often
from heart problems. He returned to the United States on a mission to prove that
cholesterol and dietary fat were the direct sources of heart disease.
Keys published many studies in the 1960s and ’70s that demonstrated higher
cholesterol levels in patients with heart disease; he also showed that increased
consumption of dietary fat led to higher cholesterol. Keys’ seminal “Seven Countries”
study (1980) was a 500-page volume dedicated to the concept that, through its
cholesterol content, dietary fat was the single cause of heart disease. Unfortunately,
based on his own work, there are four problems with his thesis.
1.   The Seven Countries study started out as the Twenty-two Countries study. Keys’
seven countries were Japan, Italy, England, Wales (included as a separate country by
Keys), Australia, Canada, and the United States. For these seven, the relationship
between dietary fat and heart disease looked pretty convincing. But when all twenty-
two countries were plotted (add Austria, Ceylon, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Sweden, and Switzerland), the correlation became a lot less convincing. He also chose
to leave out “indigenous tribes,” such as the Inuit (North America), Tokelau (Oceania),
and Maasai and Rendille (both Africa), who ate only animal fat and have among the
lowest prevalence of heart disease on the planet.
2.   The role of dietary fat in heart disease is complicated by the consumption of
trans fats (e.g., margarine), which are a significant factor in the etiology of metabolic
syndrome. Trans-fat use peaked in the 1960s with the advent and popularization of
margarine—remember Imperial Margarine, “fit for a king”?—just as Keys was starting
his epidemiologic research. Could he have been studying an effect of trans fat instead of
saturated fat in the developed countries? Since he did not separate the two in his work,
we don’t know.
3.   The correlation itself is a problem. At one end of the graph are Japan and Italy,
as they eat the least amount of saturated fat. But they also eat the least amount of dietary
sugar of all the countries included. How can you determine whether it is the fat or the
sugar that is driving this relationship when both go together?
4.   On
page 262
 of his mega-opus, Keys wrote, “The fact that the incidence rate of
coronary heart disease was significantly correlated with the average percentage of
calories from
sucrose
 in the diets is explained by the intercorrelation of sucrose with
saturated fat.” In other words, sucrose also correlated with heart disease, but Keys did
not think this was an issue. When one does a multivariate correlation analysis
(determining whether A causes B regardless of the impact of C, D, and E) one has to do
it
both ways
; in this case, one would need to hold sucrose constant and show that
dietary fat still correlates with heart disease. Keys didn’t perform this kind of analysis.
We don’t know why. So which was it—the fat or the sugar?
Kick It up a Notch, and BAM…
In the midst of the Yudkin-Keys battle came the lipid hypothesis of heart disease. In the
1970s, the Nobel Prize–winning team of Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein in
Dallas discovered how the liver recycled fatty acids.

 From this discovery we learned
four important precepts. First, we identified LDL, or low-density lipoproteins (the main
export particle of dietary fat), and the liver LDL receptor (which gobbles them up to
recycle them). Second, we learned that dietary fat increased blood LDL levels. Third,
one rare genetic disease generates massively high LDL levels, and these patients die of
heart attacks very early in life. Fourth, in large populations of adults, blood LDL levels
correlate with risk for coronary heart disease.
The implications of this work seem quite logical on the surface. Let’s call dietary
fat A, LDL B, and cardiovascular disease C. The implication was that “If A leads to B,
and B correlates with C, then A must lead to C; therefore, no A, no C.”
This was the debate of the late 1970s, specifically taken up by Senator George
McGovern’s bipartisan, nonlegislative Select Committee on Nutrition and Human
Needs in 1977, and chronicled by Gary Taubes.

 McGovern appointed a labor reporter
named Nick Mottern, who had no scientific background, to research and write the first
dietary goals for the United States. Rather than doing extensive research on the subject,
Mottern relied almost exclusively on the work of Mark Hegsted, a nutritionist at the
Harvard School for Public Health. Hegsted was of the opinion that dietary fat was the
ultimate cause of dietary woes in the United States, and that the solution was to limit its
intake. Thus, Mottern’s report recommended that the American populace limit its fat
intake to 30 percent of their diet and saturated fat to 10 percent. Mottern admitted that
not all scientists agreed with his suggestions, but he stated that Americans could only
improve their health by following his advice. What did they have to lose?
Although it took seven years and several twists and turns, the USDA, the AHA, and
the American Society of Clinical Nutrition all endorsed the document. Mottern’s
brainchild,
Dietary Goals for the United States
, was implemented, and our dietary
practices began to change as the
food industry retooled itself to deliver low-fat
products rushed to meet the new directives.
What Went Wrong?
Seems logical—A to B to C; so no A, no C—i.e., no dietary fat, therefore no LDL, and
no heart disease. Not so fast. A can lead to B, but it can also lead to D, E, F, and G, and
never make it back to C. And the contrapositive of the statement is, “No C, no A.” This
is flawed logic, to be sure.
The implicit assumption was that all LDL was bad. As it turns out, there are
two
types of LDLs: one is called large buoyant LDL, or type A LDL, and the other is called
small dense LDL, or type B LDL. Large buoyant LDL floats in the bloodstream. It’s too
big to get underneath the cells lining your blood vessels to start the atherosclerotic
(artery wall thickening) process. Eighty percent of blood LDL is large buoyant and is
thought to be neutral from a cardiovascular standpoint. However, small dense LDL
doesn’t float; it sinks. It’s small enough to get underneath the blood vessel cells and has
been specifically implicated in the start of atherosclerotic plaques. True, dietary fat
raises LDL, but it’s the large buoyant kind. The small dense variation is raised by
carbohydrates.

Here’s one more fly in the ointment. Dietary fat isn’t one entity. It’s at least seven,
listed in
table 10.1
. Some of these, such as omega-3 fatty acids, are good for you and
protective against heart disease. Trans fats are disasters because our mitochondria
can’t break them down completely for energy. Because
a calorie is not a calorie
. The
fat remnants precipitate in arterial walls—a great way to get a heart attack. Omega-6
fats are pro-inflammatory and associated with heart disease. Keys’ personal demon
was saturated fat, which is in the middle of this spectrum and does neither harm nor
good. Indeed, recent studies have exonerated saturated fat from a primary role in the
atherogenic process.

But the proof’s in the low-fat pudding, right? Does a low-fat diet prevent heart
disease or not? This was put to the test in the Women’s Health Initiative, started in
1993. The study followed nearly fifty thousand postmenopausal women over eight
years. Fat (saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated) was decreased in their
diets to 30 percent of their total calories—but there was no change in the incidence of
heart attack or stroke. A long-term, prospective, randomized controlled study on a lot of
people, and it was a bust.

The Devolution of Our Diet
Nevertheless, in the early 1980s, none of these concerns about sugar, carbohydrates,
and types of fats was known. With the endorsement of the
Dietary Guidelines
, Keys
delivered the knockout punch and won the food fight, while Yudkin was thrown under
the bus. We were beseeched to reduce our consumption of dietary fat from 40 to 30
percent. The food industry had to retool its products to meet the demand for low-fat
fare. This meant altering its recipes. But when you take the fat out, the food tastes like
cardboard. And palatability equals sales. The food industry had to find ways to make
this low-fat fare palatable. They therefore upped the carbohydrate content, specifically
the sugar. An example is Nabisco SnackWells, which are still stocked on the shelves.
For each serving, 2 grams of fat were removed and 13 grams of carbohydrates, 4 of
which were sugar, were added.
In the 1990s there was a major shift in the availability of specific foodstuffs. The
foods containing fat, such as milk, saw a drop or a stabilization in consumption.
Conversely, levels of refined carbohydrates, devoid of their inherent fiber, went
through the roof. Remember, refined carbohydrates means lots of insulin, which means
more energy storage in fat tissue. And thus the obesity epidemic was born in the
aftermath of this seemingly logical and well-meaning, yet tragically flawed,
understanding of our biochemistry.
The gradual understanding that dietary fat isn’t always the demon that it was
portrayed to be in the
Dietary Guidelines
, and the work of Dr. Robert Atkins and other
pioneers, led to the introduction of the “low-carb diet” into the American lexicon.
Restaurants started serving cheeseburgers wrapped in a lettuce leaf instead of a bun
(hold the fries). By the early 2000s, the carbohydrate-restricted diet was put to the test;
it went head to head against the low-fat diet for the treatment of obesity and type 2
diabetes. From controlled studies, we learned the following five lessons

:
First,
carbohydrate restriction improves glucose control, the primary target of diabetes
therapy. Second, carbohydrate-restricted diets are at least as effective for weight loss
as low-fat diets. Third, substitution of fat for carbohydrates is generally beneficial for
markers of and incidence of heart disease. Four, carbohydrate restriction improves
features of metabolic syndrome. Five, the beneficial effects of carbohydrate restriction
are independent of weight loss. (Look at Sally.) Carbohydrate restriction lives on in
many guises throughout the food world. Yet so do the vegan, traditional Japanese, and
other low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets.
Because the two overlap.
There is one specific foodstuff that is both fat
and
 carbohydrate at the same time.
It’s the one item that’s excluded from every successful diet in the world. It the
real
omnivore’s curse. And it’s the real culprit of the global obesity and metabolic
syndrome pandemic.
Chapter 11
Fructose—The “Toxin”
Gabriel is a 100-pound eight-year-old boy who has mildly elevated
blood pressure. His father is a type 2 diabetic and has already had a
gastric bypass. A dietary analysis of the family’s eating habits exhibits
no abnormalities,
except
 that the father is a truck driver for the Odwalla
juice company and is allowed to bring home as much product as he
wants. Gabriel’s mother limits her son to one glass of juice per day, but
he admits to drinking three glasses per day. We counsel the parents to
remove juice from the house. Within one year, the father loses 20
pounds and his diabetes improves, while Gabriel has not gained any
weight and his blood pressure has returned to normal.
The Fructose Epidemic
Can low-fat and low-carb diets
both
 be right? Or
both
 wrong? What do the Atkins diet
(protein and fat), the Ornish diet (vegetables and whole grains), and the traditional
Japanese diet (carbohydrate and protein) have in common? On the surface they seem to
be diametrically opposite. But they all have one thing in common: they restrict sugar.
Every successful diet in history restricts sugar. Sugar is, bar none, the most successful
food additive known to man. When the food industry adds it for “palatability,” we buy
more. And because it’s cheap, some version of sugar appears in
virtually every
processed foodstuff now manufactured in the world. Sugar, and specifically fructose, is
the Lex Luthor of this story.
Nutritionists routinely categorize sugar as “empty calories,” interchangeable with
calories from starch. But sugar has a special payload. Sugar (sucrose) is made up of
half glucose and half fructose. It’s the fructose that makes it sweet, and that, ultimately,
is the molecule we seek. It’s the fructose that causes chronic metabolic disease. So
sugar, despite ostensibly being a carbohydrate, is
really
 both a fat (because that’s how
fructose is metabolized in the liver) and a carbohydrate (because that’s how glucose is
metabolized) all rolled into one. Both pathways have to work overtime, which is why
sugar is the real omnivore’s dilemma. Now, if you’re starving and energy-depleted,
consuming sugar can replete your liver’s glycogen stores more rapidly, which can be
beneficial. So offensive linemen after three hours on the gridiron can consume all the
Gatorade they want. But the overwhelming majority of people are neither starving nor
energy-depleted (there are now 30 percent more obese individuals than undernourished
ones on the planet). Our bodies have not adapted to our current environmental sugar
glut, and it is killing us…slowly.
Fructose has increased both as a percentage of our caloric intake and our total
consumption. When you add it up, Americans currently consume sugar at a rate of 6.5
ounces a day, or 130 pounds a year. Our current fructose consumption has increased
fivefold compared to a hundred years ago, and has more than doubled in the last thirty
years.

 A recent survey by the CDC estimates that 50 percent of Americans have one
can of sugared soda per day, and 5 percent of Americans have four or more.

 In other
words, we’re not just eating more—we’re increasing both the amount of sugar we eat,
and sugar as a percentage of our daily caloric allotment. The inescapable reality is that
20–25 percent of all the calories we consume, a total of twenty-two teaspoons per day,
comes from some variation of sugar.

 And some adolescents are consuming 40 percent
of their calories as sugar. This can’t be good for you.
Okay, America is sugar-dipped and candy-coated. But that’s not true elsewhere—or
is it? World sugar consumption has tripled in the last fifty years, while the population
has only doubled. That means our global per capita intake of sugar has increased by 50
percent, commensurate with this
pandemic. The upper threshold of 200 calories per day
of sugar, advocated by the American Heart Association in its scientific statement for
optimal cardiovascular health,

 has been exceeded in virtually every country on the
planet.

 This is a massive increase from just thirty years ago, when most countries were
bereft of sugar.
When reading the title of this chapter, your first reaction may be “Aha! I knew it!
High-fructose corn syrup is evil.” You’re half right. Media attention and consumer
activist groups have started to vilify HFCS due to its synthetic nature and assumed
effect on the obesity epidemic. As a result, its consumption has been declining since
2007. But our rates of obesity remain unchanged. HFCS is ubiquitous in the United
States and Canada, but it is used more sparingly in the European Union and Japan. The
rest of the world uses sucrose. Australia and the entire Pacific Rim, for example, have
only sucrose, but they are right behind us in terms of obesity and metabolic syndrome.
Scientific studies of acute satiety versus energy intake and of metabolic alterations
support the notion that HFCS is technically no different from sucrose, although HFCS
does generate a higher blood fructose level, which could have negative metabolic
consequences.

 This has led to a vociferous campaign by the Corn Refiners
Association, and its public commercials, arguing that HFCS is a natural, out-of-the
ground, and benign sweetener. HFCS is biochemically similar to “natural” sucrose
(made of glucose and fructose), taking “corn syrup” (glucose) through an enzymatic
process so that approximately half the glucose becomes fructose, in order to make it
sweeter. The question is not whether HFCS is worse or better than sugar; the question
is whether sugar (in any of its forms) is
toxic
?
The health-conscious among you may opt for juice over soda. For those of you who
can afford it, you skip the Sunny Delite in favor of “natural 100 percent fruit juices”
made by Odwalla or other organic companies. They tout multiple health benefits and
claim that, because they are devoid of added sweeteners, they are in fact good for you.
Wrong. The fruit is good for you, because it also contains fiber (see
chapter 12
). In fact,
calorie for calorie, 100 percent orange juice is worse for you than soda, because the
orange juice contains 1.8 grams of fructose per ounce, while the soda contains 1.7
grams of fructose per ounce.
All caloric sweeteners contain fructose: white sugar, cane sugar, beet
sugar, fruit
sugar, table sugar, brown sugar, and its cheaper cousin HFCS. Add to this maple syrup,
honey, and agave nectar. It’s all the same. The vehicle is irrelevant; it’s the payload that
matters. Bottom line, sugar consumption is a problem, 33 percent of sugar consumption
comes from beverages, and the biggest abusers are the poor and underserved.
A Carbohydrate Is a Carbohydrate—or Is It?
All carbohydrates are not created equal. Just as there are different gradations of fats
(see
chapter 10
), there are different gradations of carbohydrates based on their
metabolism.

 To illustrate how this works, consider the following exercise involving
the metabolism of three different carbohydrates of equal caloric value (120 calories):
glucose, ethanol (grain alcohol), and fructose.
Glucose
Despite its absolute necessity for life (see
chapter 10
), dietary glucose isn’t perfect.
When it exists in nature without fructose, it’s called “starch,” and it truly does supply
“empty calories,” energy for either storage or burning. But the Atkins, Paleo, and
caloric-restriction adherents will all tell you that the glucose molecule has three
metabolic downsides, all of which do damage over time and necessitate the limitation
of its consumption. To demonstrate this, let’s consume 120 calories of glucose (e.g.,
one-half cup cooked white rice). Twenty percent, or 24 calories, will enter the liver,
whereas the rest will be metabolized by other organs in the body. Here’s what happens:
1.   Glucose metabolism is insulin-dependent. Consuming glucose raises the glucose
level in the bloodstream, stimulating insulin release, which promotes energy
storage into fat cells and causes weight gain.
2.   The overwhelming majority of glucose in the liver will be directed toward
forming glycogen, or liver starch, which is not harmful
to the liver cell. This
also will keep the liver from releasing glucose into the blood, preventing
diabetes.
3.   A small amount of glucose will be metabolized by the liver mitochondria for
energy.
4.   Any excess glucose in the liver that is not shunted to glycogen and not
metabolized by the mitochondria for energy will instead be converted to
triglycerides. High triglyceride levels in the blood can promote development of
cardiovascular disease.
5.   Glucose can bind to proteins in the cell, which causes two problems:
•  When glucose binds to proteins throughout the body, the proteins become less
flexible, contributing to the aging process and causing organ dysfunction.
•  Every time a glucose molecule binds to a protein, it releases a reactive
oxygen species (ROS; see
chapter 9
), which can cause tissue damage if not
immediately mopped up by an antioxidant in the peroxisome (see
chapter 14
).
Like all things, glucose in excess can be bad for you—especially when it lacks
fiber, which limits the insulin response (see
chapter 12
). However, you would have to
consume a lot of it and over a long period of time for glucose to have these detrimental
effects. In general, large amounts of glucose (starches such as pasta, white bread, rice,
etc.) will cause you to gain pounds but it won’t make you sick. Rather, if over time you
gain too much weight from glucose, the visceral fat that is formed will eventually take
its toll on your health (see
chapter 8
). But when you consume the same number of
calories as either ethanol or fructose, you get much more of a bang to your liver (more
like a hand grenade), and it takes its toll that much faster.
Ethanol (Grain Alcohol)
Ethanol is a naturally occurring by-product of carbohydrate metabolism, called
fermentation. Upon ingestion of 120 calories of ethanol (e.g., a 1.5-ounce shot of 80-
proof hard spirits), 10 percent (12 calories)
is metabolized within the stomach and
intestine (called the first-pass effect) and 10 percent is metabolized by the brain and
other organs. The metabolism in the brain is what leads to the alcohol’s intoxicating
effects. Approximately 96 calories reach the liver—four times more than with glucose.
And that’s important, as the detrimental effects are dose-dependent.
1.   After ethanol enters the liver in high dosages, it can promote ROS formation and
cell damage.
2.   In contrast to glucose, which went to glycogen, the ethanol goes straight to the
mitochondria.
3.   Any excess gets turned into fat by a process called
de novo
 (new) lipogenesis
(fat-making). The lipid buildup can lead to liver insulin resistance and
inflammation.
4.   If this process continues, it can eventually cause alcoholic liver disease. This is
a surefire prescription for slow death or, at best, a liver transplant.
5.   Alternatively, the lipid can exit the liver and take up residence in skeletal
muscle, where it also induces insulin resistance and can cause heart disease.
6.   Lastly, ethanol enhances its own consumption, by acting on the brain’s reward
pathway. When this goes out of control (chapter 5), addiction sets in.
Thus, for the same number of calories, ethanol is more likely than glucose to cause
chronic disease.
Fructose
Fructose is never found alone in nature. Rather, it is always partnered with its more
benign sister molecule, glucose. They both have the same chemical composition
(C

H

O

), but they are hardly the same. Fructose is much worse. Let’s start with the
Maillard, or “browning,” reaction. This is the same reaction that turns hemoglobin in
your red blood cells into hemoglobin A1c (HbA
1c
), the lab test that doctors follow to
determine how high a diabetic patient’s blood sugar has risen over time. The reaction
product is brown; this is the reason bananas turn brown with time and also why
barbecue sauce caramelizes the meat underneath when exposed to heat. So, you can
brown your meat at 375 degrees for one hour, or you can brown your meat at 98.6
degrees for seventy-five years. The result is the same. And fructose drives the Maillard
reaction seven times faster than glucose.

 This seemingly subtle difference can cause
every cell in the body to age more rapidly, driving various degenerative processes such
as aging, cancer, and cognitive decline.
There are dozens of studies that now implicate fructose as a major player in causing
metabolic syndrome. In fact, it’s metabolized a lot like ethanol. Let’s now consume 120
calories of sucrose (60 of glucose, 60 of fructose)—for example, an 8-ounce glass of
orange juice. (As I mentioned before, juice is just as bad as soda, if not worse.) The 60
calories of glucose do the same 20-80 split, so 12 calories of glucose will enter the
liver. But, unlike with glucose, which can be metabolized by all organs, the liver is the
primary site of fructose metabolism (although the kidney has the capacity to metabolize
a few calories in rare cases). Give or take, the whole 60 calories of fructose end up in
the liver. So, the liver gets a 72-calorie dose, triple the amount as with glucose alone.
The unique metabolism of fructose can induce each of the phenomena associated
with metabolic syndrome:
1.   Triple the dose means the liver needs triple the energy to metabolize this combo
versus glucose alone, depleting the liver cell of adenosine triphosphate (or
ATP, the vital chemical that conveys energy within cells). ATP depletion leads
to the generation of the waste product uric acid. Uric acid causes gout and
increases blood pressure.
2.   The fructose does not go to glycogen. It goes straight to the mitochondria.
Excess acetyl-CoA is formed, exceeding the mitochondria’s ability to
metabolize it.
3.   The excess acetyl-CoA leaves the mitochondria and gets metabolized into fat,

which can promote heart disease (see
chapter 9
).
4.   Fructose activates a liver enzyme, which is the bridge between liver
metabolism and inflammation. This inactivates a key messenger of insulin
action, leading to liver insulin resistance.
5.   The lack of insulin effect in the liver means that there is no method to keep the
glucose down, so the blood glucose rises, which can eventually lead to
diabetes.
6.   The liver insulin resistance means the pancreas has to release extra insulin,
which can force extra energy into fat cells, leading to obesity (see
chapter 4
).
And the fat cells that fill up most are in the visceral fat, the bad kind associated
with metabolic disease.
7.   The high insulin can also drive the growth of many cancers.

8.   The high insulin blocks leptin signaling (see
chapters 4
 and

), giving the
hypothalamus the false sense of “starvation,” and causing you to eat more.
9.   Fructose may also contribute to breakdown of the intestinal barrier. Normally
the intestine prevents bacteria from entering the bloodstream. This intestinal
breakdown may lead to a breach in the walls of the intestine. The result is a
“leaky gut,”

 which could increase the body’s exposure to inflammation and
more ROS. This worsens insulin resistance and drives the insulin levels even
higher.

10. Fructose undergoes the Maillard (browning) reaction 7 times faster than
glucose, which can damage cells directly. Although the experiments are in their
infancy, preliminary results suggest that in a susceptible environment, fructose
can accelerate aging and the development of cancer.
11. The data on fructose and dementia in humans are currently correlative and
indirect. However, the data on insulin resistance and dementia show clear
causation. African Americans and Latinos are the biggest fructose consumers
and those with the highest waist circumference (a marker for insulin resistance).
Coincidentally, they also have the highest risk for dementia.
Fructose versus Ethanol: Pick Your Poison
Studies of alcohol use show that a little bit is good for you. Alcohol raises HDL (good
cholesterol), and red wine has the compound resveratrol, which is thought to improve
insulin sensitivity and longevity (see
chapter 14
). As with alcohol, a small dose of
fructose has been shown in some studies to have a beneficial effect on insulin secretion.
The toxic effects of fructose, just like those of alcohol, are dose-dependent. For
alcohol, we have empiric evidence that in most people, a maximum dose of 50 grams
per day (about three glasses of wine) is the threshold for toxicity.

 This is likely the
threshold for fructose as well (slightly less than a quart of orange juice). The problem
is that the current
average
 adult fructose consumption is 51 grams per day. That means
that more than half the population is over the threshold.
When you look at chronic alcoholics versus those consuming massive amounts of
sugar, they often appear very different, at least on the outside. Many alcoholics are thin,
if puffy, compared to those consuming massive amounts of sugar. But remember, we’re
not concerned with subcutaneous fat. It’s the visceral fat—the fat that surrounds your
organs and often remains invisible to the naked eye—that’s going to kill you. Both
alcohol and sugar significantly increase your visceral fat and your likelihood of
developing associated diseases. The difference between alcoholic fatty liver disease
and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease lies only in the terminology—the effect on the body
is the same.
Of course, the major difference between alcohol and sugar is alcohol’s intoxicating
effects; the brain does not metabolize fructose. People don’t get arrested for driving
under the influence of sugar. But the liver’s metabolism of fructose is remarkably
similar to that of ethanol. Fructose isn’t the only cause of obesity, but it is the primary
cause of
chronic
 metabolic disease, which kills…slowly. Fructose can fry your liver
and cause all the same diseases as does alcohol. We know we must limit our ethanol
consumption or face the consequences. But sugar flies under the radar. No wonder
Saudi Arabia and Malaysia have the highest rates of type 2 diabetes on the planet. No
alcohol, but they’re drinking soft drinks like they’re going out of style.
Sugar and the Global Diabetes Pandemic
According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the global diabetes pandemic
currently claims 366 million people. That’s a prevalence rate of 5.5 percent of the
world’s population. And they’re breaking the bank on health care worldwide (see
chapter 1
). While it would be easy to lay the blame on the fast food industry, whose
outlets continue to propagate worldwide, lots of countries whose populations do not
overindulge in McDonald’s are also experiencing increases in obesity and diabetes.
What’s changed in the food globally?
My colleague Sanjay Basu and I are attempting to answer that question by looking at
food supply data worldwide. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) monitors
the world’s food supply. FAO keeps close tabs on food supply data, broken up by type
of foodstuff. We linked the FAO food supply database with the IDF prevalence
database and with the World Bank Gross National Income database (to control for
poverty). We are currently performing an epidemiological analysis for 154 countries
around the world, known as an “ecological” analysis, between the years 2000 and
2010. We asked two questions: Does the increase in caloric intake per capita correlate
with increase in diabetes prevalence? And if so, is there any aspect of the diet that
explains this relationship?
In the time period we studied, diabetes prevalence worldwide rose from 5.5
percent to 7.0 percent. Surprisingly, total calories did not correlate with diabetes
prevalence worldwide. Instead, the correlation with the percentage of calories coming
from sugar and sugarcrops was enormous. For every 100 calories supplied as sugar, the
prevalence of diabetes rose by 0.9 percent, even after controlling for obesity in each
country. The amount of sugar availability explains more than one fourth of the increase
in diabetes prevalence rates worldwide during the last decade, even after controlling
for aging and obesity in the population. And those few countries whose consumption
went down experienced a reduction in diabetes prevalence of 0.18 percent. This is not
correlation
, but rather
causation.
If you had any residual doubt about “
a calorie is not a calorie,
” this analysis
should remove it. Every additional 150 total calories per person
per day barely raised
diabetes prevalence. But if those 150 calories were instead from a can of soda,
increase in diabetes prevalence rose sevenfold. Sugar is more dangerous than its
calories.
Sugar is a toxin
. Plain and simple.
There are clear limitations to doing this kind of analysis. First, food supply does not
automatically mean consumption. However, in most parts of the world, the two are
closely aligned. Only in the United States do we throw away significant amounts of
food (up to 30 percent of what we produce). Second, populations are diverse, in
socioeconomic status, vulnerability, and food preference. So, what you learn from a
population may not be immediately ascribable to one individual. Third, estimating
diabetes prevalence is always difficult. Different countries use different criteria for
diagnosis, many people go undiagnosed, and the IDF pools people with type 1 and type
2 diabetes. Nonetheless, the robustness of the effect is undeniable. The global industrial
diet that revels in sugar consumption clearly negatively affects the metabolic health of
entire countries, unrelated to obesity.
The Sweetest Taboo: Fructose, Reward, and Addiction
Now you’re thinking: diabetes, liver dysfunction, cancer, dementia, and aging—it
couldn’t get any worse, could it? Oh, but it can. Not only does fructose turn your liver
to fat and your proteins brown, but it tells your brain that you need more of it…and
more. Remember the starvation pathway (see
chapter 4
), and the reward pathway (see
chapter 5
)? Similar to the effects of alcoholism, fructose stimulates excessive and
continued consumption by tricking your brain into wanting more. For Gabriel, one glass
of juice just wasn’t enough.
Fructose Drives Reward and Food Intake
Recall the lessons of leptin. Anything that blocks leptin signaling will be read as
starvation at the hypothalamus (
chapter 4
) and as lack of reward by the nucleus
accumbens (
chapter 5
); both of which drive long-term
food intake. And anything that
alters the meal-to-meal hunger and satiety signals will drive short-term food intake.
When you don’t feel full, you consume more. Fructose does them all.
1.   Consumption of fructose does not stimulate an insulin response, so leptin
doesn’t rise and the animal keeps eating (or drinking soda, as the case may be).
2.   Long-term fructose consumption generates liver insulin resistance and causes
chronic hyperinsulinemia (excessively high blood insulin), which interferes
with leptin signaling and promotes further food intake by preventing dopamine
clearance from the NA (see
chapter 5
).
3.   Ghrelin, a peptide produced by cells in the stomach, is the “hunger” signal. In
humans, ghrelin levels rise with increasing subjective hunger, peak at the time
of voluntary food consumption (which is why your stomach grumbles at noon),
and decrease after a meal. However, fructose intake does not decrease ghrelin;
therefore, caloric intake is not suppressed. Indeed, fructose consumption in the
form of a Big Gulp does not reduce the volume of solid food needed to feel
satiated, multiplying the total calories consumed during the meal.
Deconstructing Darwin
So why do we have this fascination with sugar in the first place? Why does sugar make
us want more? What’s the selective advantage? In
chapter 4
 we saw that insulin blocks
leptin signaling to promote leptin resistance, in order to allow the weight gain
associated with puberty and pregnancy to occur. In
chapter 5
 we saw that sugar
stimulates brain dopamine and opiates to let us know what foods are safe. But why
should sugar cause insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia? Naturally occurring sugar
in fruit is what makes fruit palatable. But for our ancestors, fruit was readily available
for one month per year, called “harvest time.” Then came four months of
winter, and no
food at all. We needed to stock up—to increase our adiposity in preparation for four
months of famine. In other words, in the doses that were available to our forebears,
sugar was evolutionarily adaptive. Indeed, fruit binges among orangutans in Indonesia
are responsible for their altered energy intake and changes in weight. For their normal
diet, they consume 21 percent of their calories as fruit—as opposed to when fruit is
plentiful during a binge, at which point that figure rises to 100 percent. This results in
high insulin, driving energy storage and cyclic adiposity.

 But with our current global
sugar glut, devoid of fiber and in high doses 24/7/365, our weight gain is not cyclic
anymore, and this process has become maladaptive.
Face it, we’ve been “frucked.”
Still, while sugar is the biggest perpetrator of our current health crisis, it is by no
means the only bad guy. There are “antidotes” to the fructose effect, but they have been
removed from our environment as well. The rest of
Part 4
 will lay bare the rest of our
“toxic environment.”
Chapter 12
Fiber—Half the “Antidote”
Sujatha is a thirteen-year-old Indian girl who has just been diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes. At a height of 5 foot 4 inches, she weighs 170
pounds. According to her BMI, she is technically obese, but she doesn’t
look it. Her mother is a nurse in a local hospital and also a type 2
diabetic. She told me, “I don’t understand how this can happen. We are
Indian, we are vegans at home.” However, the family consumes large
volumes of “white foods” such as naan, rice, potatoes, and processed
starches. Almost completely lacking from their diet are “brown foods”
such as lentils, garbanzo beans, and whole grain products. Like many
teenagers, Sujatha refuses to eat her vegetables. Beverages consist of
soda and juice, and virtually no water. The fiber content of their diet is
close to zero.
The Stealth Nutrient
Fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, is the most misunderstood weapon in our
nutritional arsenal. The common belief, promulgated by countless TV commercials
playing to the over-seventy crowd, is that fiber is important for our bowels and little
else. Fiber makes you “regular” (as if constipation makes you “erratic”?). These
commercials suggest that you should start eating fiber to make those golden years a
little smoother. Meanwhile, gastroenterologists have impressed upon us the value of
fiber to prevent both
colon cancer and diverticulitis. All that’s true—but fiber is oh so
much more. As you will see, fiber is half of the “antidote” to the obesity pandemic. But
how can something that we don’t even absorb be so darn valuable?
Unlike the other foodstuffs previously discussed—fats, proteins, and carbohydrates
—fiber isn’t digested or absorbed by your body. It travels through and out of your
stomach, small intestine, and colon with minimal alteration. The USDA does not
classify fiber as an essential nutrient; indeed, most people consider fiber a waste
product of food and a waste of time. Despite this, the Dietary Reference Intake for fiber
suggests a total of 14 grams per 1,000 calories, or essentially 25 grams of fiber per
day.

 Paleobiologists have performed DNA footprint analyses of three- to ten-thousand-
year-old stool samples from caves in Texas, allowing them to determine what our
ancestors ate based on the bacterial makeup of their intestines. They estimate that these
cave dwellers consumed about 100 grams of fiber per day,

 yet our median
consumption of fiber is currently 12 grams. Does this matter? Why should we care
about fiber? Why does processing a food remove its fiber? Aside from our current
“irregularity,” what might our lack of fiber be doing to us? After all, it’s just to make us
poop “regular,” right?
Definitions
Dietary fiber—found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes—is the part of the
plant that the human gut is unable to digest. So, you can’t use it for energy. Therefore it
has one destination: the toilet. There are two types of fiber: soluble, which dissolves in
water, and insoluble, which does not (see
table 12.1
). This difference determines each
type of fiber’s impact on your body, health, and stool. Soluble fiber slows digestion
and absorption, and is fermented by the bacteria of your colon into gases (read: socially
unacceptable emissions except for teen boys at summer camp). This is one reason we
haven’t missed the removal of fiber from our diet. It consists of strings of glucose
molecules such as pectins (found in fruit and used to make jelly) that absorb water to
become a gelatinous, viscous substance. Insoluble fiber consists of polysaccharides
(non-glucose carbohydrates)
such as cellulose, the stringy stuff in celery. They are not
digested at all. Because they do not dissolve in water, they have a laxative effect and
speed up the passage of food and waste through your gut.
Table 12.1: Sources of Dietary Fiber
Soluble Fiber (absorbs water)
Insoluble Fiber (doesn’t absorb water)
oatmeal, oat cereal, lentils, apples, oranges,
pears, oat bran, strawberries, nuts,
flaxseeds, beans, dried peas, blueberries,
psyllium, cucumbers, and carrots
whole wheat, whole grains, wheat bran, corn bran, seeds, nuts, barley,
couscous, brown rice, bulgur, zucchini, celery, broccoli, cabbage,
onions, tomatoes, celery, carrots, cucumbers, green beans, dark leafy
vegetables, fruit, and root vegetable skins
Metabolically, the two together are an unbeatable pair.

 The insoluble fiber forms a
latticework for the soluble fiber to sit on, while the soluble fiber bridges the gaps in the
latticework to maintain its integrity—kind of like the hair catcher on your shower drain.
Without it, the hair goes down the drain rapidly. But when the hair catcher catches the
hair, now you’ve got a stopped-up bathtub. In the case of fiber, however, inhibiting the
rate of flux from the intestine crossing into the bloodstream is a good thing. It gives the
liver a chance to fully metabolize what’s coming in, so there’s no “overflow.”
Unfortunately, the majority of the foods we are consume today lack fiber of any sort.
Refined grains are stripped of both the bran and the germ in the process of milling. This
gives them a finer texture and extends their shelf life while taking out various
micronutrients (see
chapter 14
) and, in particular, fiber. Refined grains include white
rice, white flour, pasta, potatoes, and many of the cookies, crackers, and cereals that
stock your pantry. “Enriched” grains may replace some of the nutrients removed, but
once the fiber is taken out you can’t put it back in.
The Fallacy Surrounding Fiber
To get the full metabolic benefits of fiber, it needs to “coat” the starch granule on all
sides (forming a sphere, or a “kernel”) so that the digestive enzymes in
the intestine
must slowly strip it away. The starch (endosperm) is on the inside. The bran is on the
outside. The whole kernel represents a source of insoluble fiber. Strip away the outside
bran, and you are left only with the starch (glucose). When you ingest the whole kernel,
your intestines will slowly strip away the outside bran, making the rise in serum
glucose occur slowly and reach a lower peak concentration. But when the outside bran
is removed by processing, your liver is hit with an influx of glucose and the rise occurs
quickly, with a higher peak. And that means a higher insulin peak.
So, to derive maximal effects from fiber, you need to consume products with the
unadulterated whole grain. Naan and white rice, the only grains in Sujatha’s diet,
ceased to be grains after being polished at the mill. But here’s the problem: even
“whole grain” doesn’t always mean “whole grain.” According to the IOM, food must
meet at least one of the following criteria to be considered “whole grain”: (1) contain
at least 8 grams of whole grain per serving, (2) qualify for the FDA whole grain health
claim (51 percent whole grain by weight), or (3) have a whole grain as the first
ingredient by weight for non-mixed dishes (e.g., breads, cereals) or as the first grain
ingredient by weight for mixed dishes (e.g., pizza, corn dogs). (So “whole grain” Lucky
Charms is a misnomer as there are no “whole” grains in the cereal.) Manufacturers may
mix in regular starch with the whole grain, but that’s not a great idea if you’re trying to
keep insulin down.
There is nothing in the IOM’s definition about the grain being “whole”—that is,
uncracked, uncrushed, unadulterated. Plus, foods that list “whole grains” as the second
or third ingredient may contain as little as 1 percent. Hence, the IOM definition leaves
much to be desired.
The Jive on Juice
Whereas fruit does contain fructose, it also has inherent fiber. And that’s not by
accident. The reason the fructose in fruit doesn’t cause significant health problems is
that it’s balanced by the endogenous fiber that makes up the solid part of the fruit. If you
consume both together, as Nature intended, it reduces the rate of flux to the liver; the
liver can keep up, which mitigates most of the negative effects of the sugar. In fact, the
amount of fructose
in most fruits is balanced nicely by the fruit’s fiber content.
Conversely, juice is devoid of the insoluble fiber found in whole vegetables and fruits.
When “juicing,” you keep some of the essential vitamins and minerals (but not all)
inherent in the fruit or vegetable, but you discard perhaps the most important part: the
fiber. Remember, it doesn’t matter where the fructose comes from—fruit, sugarcane,
beets—without the fiber, it has the same metabolic effect on your body. Our ancestors
didn’t have the health complications associated with fructose because they ate the
whole fruit.
One current fad is to juice the entire fruit into a “smoothie.” Juice bars have popped
up all over the West Coast, ostensibly because juicing is healthy. The problem is that
the shearing action of the blender blades completely destroys the insoluble fiber of the
fruit. The cellulose is torn to smithereens. While the soluble fiber is still there, and can
help move food through the intestine faster, it now does not have the “latticework” of
the insoluble fiber to help form that intestinal barrier. The sugar in the fruit will be
absorbed just as fast as if the juice were strained with no fiber at all. You need both
types of fiber to derive the beneficial effects.
Chapter 4 showed us that insulin is the bad guy in terms of weight gain and that
keeping insulin down is a priority to combat obesity. The amount and rapidity at which
energy arrives at the mitochondria trigger the disease associated with metabolic
syndrome (see
chapter 9
). In other words, the two elements to keep in mind are: the
dose of carbohydrate (to keep the insulin down) and the flux of carbohydrates (to keep
the liver happy and functioning properly). Fiber takes care of both.
A Waste Product, or a “Waist” Product
As you saw in
chapter 11
, the glucose in sugar drives the insulin up, while the fructose
brings a huge dose of energy straight to the liver for immediate processing, both of
which drive obesity and metabolic syndrome (one of the reasons Sujatha developed
diabetes). Fiber possesses five different properties that assist in fighting obesity and
metabolic syndrome by keeping insulin down and reducing the energy hitting the liver.
1. The Annals of Absorption
Once fiber (soluble and insoluble) is consumed with a meal, it forms a gelatinous
barrier between the food and the intestinal wall. This delays the intestine’s ability to
absorb glucose, fructose, and fat. By slowing glucose absorption, the blood glucose
rise is attenuated, which limits the peak glucose. In return, the pancreas, sensing the
slower and lower rise in blood glucose, limits its response and reduces the amount of
insulin released. Less insulin means less shunting of energy to fat. When patients with
type 2 diabetes ate a high-fiber diet, blood sugar was cut by one third, thereby reducing
the total insulin load of the body.

The same thing happens with the absorption of fructose.

 Not only does fiber reduce
the dose, it reduces the “flux”—that is, the rate at which fructose is absorbed and
arrives at the liver cell for processing. The liver then has a chance to “catch up” and is
able to process the fructose molecules to acetyl-CoA at essentially the same rate that
new ones are being introduced. This allows them to burn in the mitochondrial Krebs
cycle (see
chapter 10
), instead of overwhelming the mitochondria, to be shunted out and
turned into fat, causing subsequent insulin resistance. So, consuming fruit, despite its
fructose content, is not nearly as big a problem because the fructose is for the most part
mitigated by the presence of fiber.
2. Calories and Cholesterol
Lower blood cholesterol levels are associated with lower rates of heart disease in
large populations. One purpose of cholesterol is to aid in the production of bile acids
(which help absorb fats in the intestine), some of which are excreted in your stool. So,
if you manage to get rid of the bile acids, you lower your cholesterol. Because soluble
fiber binds to bile acids, it can help lower LDL (“bad cholesterol”). Insoluble fiber
also decreases cholesterol and helps lower blood glucose.
3. Speed and Satiety
You eat a whole plate of macaroni and cheese, yet you’re still hungry. Why? Food in
the stomach reduces ghrelin levels, which should tell
the hypothalamus that you’re not
hungry anymore. But you still are. The reason is that lack of hunger isn’t the same
phenomenon as satiety. After food moves through the small intestine, a hormone called
peptide YY
(3-36)
 (PYY) is released into the bloodstream, which binds to receptors in
the hypothalamus and tells you that you’re full. PYY is the satiety signal.

 The problem
is that there are twenty-two feet of intestine that the food has to traverse before the PYY
signal is generated. That takes time. So anything that will move the food through the
intestine faster will generate the satiety signal sooner. Insoluble fiber does just that; it
increases the speed of transit through your gut in order to generate the PYY signal
earlier. Soluble fiber forms a sticky gel, delaying the emptying of your stomach, making
you feel full faster. Both types of fiber can cut down on the need for consuming second
portions, helping to prevent further weight gain.

4. Fat or Fart
With the presence of fiber, some of the dietary fat will be delayed from absorption in
the small intestine. Instead, these fiber-delayed dietary fats will make it all the way to
the colon, where they won’t be absorbed, thus keeping insulin low.

 Although
controversy remains, it is thought that insoluble fiber contributes more significantly to
the effects on obesity and insulin resistance than does soluble fiber. The downside of
this process is that this fiber will generate a lot of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane,
and a little hydrogen sulfide in the process. In other words, it’s
fat
 or
fart.
5. Bowels and Bugs
The human body contains about ten trillion cells. But your gut harbors about a hundred
trillion bacteria. They outnumber us ten to one! For years, we thought they were just
along for the ride, making gas at inopportune times and visiting upon us the occasional
“traveler’s revenge.” But those bacteria are a big part of our energy metabolism. Most
of the gut bacteria live in the large intestine and are anaerobic, which means they
metabolize without oxygen and therefore waste more energy than oxygen burners. Well,
if all our nutrients (including fat, glucose, and fructose) are absorbed
in our small
intestine, what do the large intestinal bacteria have left to eat? What we can’t absorb—
the fiber, and in particular, the soluble fiber. This is why so many fiber supplements,
such as psyllium, give people so much gas.
There are thousands of species of gut bacteria, but science has thus far focused on
three:
Bacteroidetes
,
Firmicutes
, and
Archae
. Almost assuredly, the bacterial
composition of the gut is one of the factors that promote weight gain in some people.
And the fiber composition of the diet is one of the factors that determine the bacterial
profile,

 because fiber delivers more nutrients farther down the intestine, where the
bacteria can utilize them for energy.

 Taken all together, it would appear that altering
the fiber content of the diet alters the bacterial content in the gut, allowing for
“beneficial” bacteria to proliferate while keeping the “obesogenic” bacteria at bay.

Fiber and Insulin Resistance
So does dietary fiber consumption promote weight loss? Here’s where the design of the
study makes a big difference. If you keep calorie intake constant, the addition of fiber
does not demonstrate significant effects on weight. However, in a free-range situation,
where people get to choose how much they eat, higher dietary fiber appears to limit
total food intake, which likely results in decreased weight. High-fiber foods tend to be
less “energy dense,” so you are consuming fewer calories for the same quantity of food.
Also they often require more time to chew, giving your body more time to receive its
satiety signal, and they move the food through the intestine faster, generating the satiety
signal sooner.
The role of dietary fiber in the prevention of metabolic diseases is complicated by
which kind of fiber you are talking about and what kind of study you are referring to. In
the Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), dietary analysis demonstrated
only one item that correlated with insulin sensitivity: fiber.

 Yet the soluble fiber
content did not correlate with improvement in diabetes risk.

 For the most part, this
improvement in insulin sensitivity was conferred by insoluble fiber (the stringy stuff).

So there goes taking soluble fiber supplements such as psyllium. It looks like you have
to get your fiber in the food itself, not from a pill. And
there’s only one way to get both
soluble and insoluble fiber: the source—and the closer it is to its original form, the
better. This concept of food being better than its components will come up again in
chapter 14
.
What Comes Out Is Just as Important as What Goes In
It’s very clear that fiber is a big deal. Not just for your bowels, but also for your
metabolism. Fiber doesn’t get absorbed. There’s no blood level of fiber, as opposed to
levels of micronutrients that improve your metabolic machinery. But by reducing both
the dose and the rate of flux of glucose, fructose, and fatty acids entering your
bloodstream, fiber keeps your insulin down. By delivering nutrients to the large
intestine to allow for fermentation, fiber improves metabolic machinery and selects for
the “good” bacteria, which help with energy loss from the colon. Finally, fiber limits
total food consumption. But it has to be eaten in the form of the whole, intact food in
order to get the full benefit, so you get both the soluble and insoluble fiber. Fiber alone
won’t mitigate all the negative effects of sugar, but it’s a hell of a good start. Want to
reverse your diabetes? Want to improve your metabolic health? Put fiber back on the
menu.
Chapter 13
J
Exercise—The Other Half of the Antidote
Britt is a depressed thirteen-year-old boy who weighs 230 pounds and
is getting bad grades, in part due to excessive “screen time.” His fifteen-
year-old brother is 320 pounds and has no intention of altering his
lifestyle. Britt sees the misery of his brother and uses him as a “negative
role model.” Over the next three years, as puberty progresses, Britt
starts wrestling in high school, practicing three to four hours a day. He
slims down without appreciably altering his diet and without shedding
any pounds. He grows into his weight and places second in the state for
his weight class. By age eighteen, his depression has lifted, his
academics have improved, and he is valedictorian of his high school
class.
ack LaLanne passed away in January 2011 at the ripe old age of ninety-six. The
“father” of modern exercise, he adopted a healthy lifestyle at age fifteen and practiced
what he preached until the day before his death. He had it right: exercise is the key to
optimal health. But not everyone benefits equally. Jim Fixx, one of the pioneer
American runners and the author of
The Complete Book of Running
, bit the bullet at
age fifty-two. Maybe Fixx died for his first thirty-five years of bad lifestyle choices:
before he took up running he smoked two packs per day and weighed 240 pounds.
How
about Arthur Ashe? The premier tennis player had a heart attack at age thirty-six.
Maybe exercise can’t reverse a lifetime of indiscretion. Maybe genetic factors play a
role. Or maybe exercise has different benefits in different people.
Either way, expecting that exercise will let you live longer is very different from
expecting that exercise can help you lose weight. LaLanne didn’t gain a pound all those
years on TV. That was because he ate properly. Don’t get me wrong; there’s nothing
bad about exercise (although it may not provide all the effects you expect). Exercise is
the single best thing you can do for yourself. It’s way more important than dieting, and
easier to do. Exercise works at so many levels—except one: your weight.
The Myth of Exercise
If “
a calorie is a calorie
” and one ingested equals one burned, then exercise should
cause weight loss, and doing a lot of exercise, even if you keep eating the same foods,
should make you shed some serious poundage. But it doesn’t. The calories you eat or
drink may have a positive effect on your weight, but the energy you burn doesn’t do the
opposite. There is not one study that demonstrates that exercise alone causes significant
weight loss, and a meta-analysis (designed to assess significance over many studies at
once) proved it; moderate exercise resulted in a weight loss of 2.2 pounds and vigorous
exercise in a loss of 3.5 pounds.

 Given our current obesity epidemic, that just ain’t
gonna cut it. As an example, a friend of mine decided to clear her post-baby “muffin
top” by initiating a moderate-to-vigorous exercise program. Twelve weeks later, she
was up five pounds. She felt better, but her muffin top hadn’t changed. She asked me
what she was doing wrong. Nothing, I told her. She was doing just fine and was likely
much healthier than at the outset. Her waist would be smaller, but the muffin top was
subcutaneous fat; she could still “pinch the inch.” She got into her pre-pregnancy jeans
anyway.
Burning a pound of fat liberates 2,500 calories, so it had always been assumed that
you can lose one pound by eating 2,500 calories less or exercising 2,500 calories more.
However, a recent scientific analysis

 shows the fallacy
of expecting increased energy
expenditure to promote weight loss. As people lost weight, their energy intake had to
drop even further to keep the weight loss going. On average, obese people had to eat
3,977 calories less to burn off that one pound of fat. So you can see that trying to burn
weight off with exercise is extremely difficult, if not downright impossible. A second
reason that exercise doesn’t cause weight loss is that when you exercise, you build
muscle. That’s good for your health, but it doesn’t reduce your weight.
If
chapters 4
–

 say anything, it’s that studying an event as complex as obesity means
looking at the entire gamut of behaviors—because, in the real world, none of them
occur in isolation, and all of them are driven by biochemistry. Guaranteed, if you hold
food intake constant and then institute vigorous activity,
some
 weight loss will follow,
but not much. That’s why every exercise plan promotes good nutrition. And that’s why
so many weight-loss programs want to sell you their food. But it’s the biochemistry that
drives the behavior.
Oh, you say to me, I know people who joined the armed forces and they lost a lot of
weight. Wrestlers do it all the time. NFL linemen show up in training camp overweight
and out of shape and by the end of exhibition season they’re back at playing weight.
This is the fact that perpetuates the myth. Anyone can lose weight if his or her
environment
 is changed. “Boot camp” is a secluded and controlled environment. Every
aspect of your daily regimen, from food to exercise to sleep, is regulated. The trick is to
change behavior while in your routine environment. Don’t bet the ranch. As we learned
in
chapter 4
, behavior is a result of biochemistry, and biochemistry is a result of
environment. Even the contestants on
The Biggest Loser
 get a personal trainer and a
chef to control their environment. But in a free-range situation, in which the general
populace finds itself, energy intake will rise to meet energy expenditure to maintain the
same level of adiposity. And in the majority of obese people, we know why: leptin…
again.
Energy Expenditure in a Nutshell
To explain energy expenditure, we’re going to assume a 2,000-calorie intake and
2,000-calorie output for an average person. This value comes
both from observation
and from the Harris-Benedict equation, a guesstimate used by dietitians to generate
dietary plans for individual patients.
Everyone equates energy expenditure with exercise. Your aerobics instructor will
yell at you, “Feel the burn.” Burning it means
burning
 it. In point of fact, physical
activity is the minority of energy expenditure, accounting for anywhere from 5 percent
(the ultimate couch potato, at about 100 calories) to 35 percent (the gym rat, at about
700 calories) of total energy expenditure based on the level and degree of activity.
While physical activity may not account for the largest percentage of energy
expenditure, it is the only component that will improve your health—and the more you
do, the better.
There are two other components. It might seem hard to believe, but the largest
percentage of your calories is burned while sleeping and watching TV (but this does
not mean that you should increase your hours on Facebook or World of Warcraft).
Resting energy expenditure (REE, the energy you burn lying on the couch) accounts for
about 60 percent (or 1,200 calories per day) of total energy expenditure, is dependent
on your size, and is usually excluded from concern. Lastly, a process called the thermic
effect of food (TEF, the energy you burn to absorb, digest, and metabolize the food you
eat) accounts for about 10 percent (or 200 calories). While it’s true that for the most
part REE and TEF are not easy to change in most people, it should be noted that some
patients with obesity exhibit problems with each. And there are some tricks to increase
REE and, to a lesser extent, TEF (see
chapter 18
).
Resting Energy Expenditure
Rudy Leibel at Columbia University in 2004 was quoted as saying, “Obese people tell
me all the time they eat very little, they eat like a bird…well, maybe a pterodactyl.” Yet
Rudy himself showed that in response to weight loss, REE declines commensurate with
the number of pounds lost, working to keep your weight stable.

 Don’t blame your
exercise regimen; blame your biochemistry. While you’re burning more energy by going
to that Zumba class, your REE is going to thwart you by evening out your overall
percentage. Fat cells want to remain filled; they aren’t going away without a fight. In
response to a decline in either leptin synthesis or leptin signaling (which the
hypothalamus interprets as starvation), REE is reduced from 50 calories per kilogram
fat-free mass to 42 calories per kilogram fat-free mass, or an improvement in energy
efficiency of 16 percent, resulting in a decrease of total energy expenditure of 0.16 x
0.65, or 10 percent. Assuming that standard adult 2,000-calorie intake, that’s a
decrease of 200 calories, which easily rivals the increase in caloric intake that has
been observed in the past thirty years.
Furthermore, there are patients that have specific reductions in REE as part of their
general pathology. As REE accounts for the majority of energy expenditure, this is the
greatest predictor of weight gain. Children with certain forms of developmental delay
are born with lack of muscle tone (called hypotonia) and are “floppy” at birth. Children
with various forms of mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g., Prader-Willi syndrome)

 burn
energy at rest about 60–70 percent of normal. This means they need fewer calories. But
that means a lower leptin, and their brain feels starved, jacking up the caloric intake.
Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
You have to put energy in to get energy out. Chewing, moving food through the GI tract,
absorbing, and processing food will burn some energy. TEF usually accounts for 10
percent (or 200 calories per day) of all energy burned. Many obese children are not
hungry when they awaken (in part because many of them had a big snack or meal just
before bedtime), so their body’s degree of energy burning is not ratcheted up prior to
their departure for school. This is one reason, among many, that eating breakfast is
important for prevention and treatment of obesity, especially in children (see
chapter

). Not eating breakfast has many other disadvantages. It means not performing well
on tasks because of distraction due to lack of food. Not eating breakfast means the
stomach hormone ghrelin, which conveys the signal for hunger, is not suppressed
throughout the morning. Obese people rationalize not eating breakfast by saying that’s
one less meal’s worth of calories. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Numerous
studies show that people who skip breakfast eat
more
 during
the daylight hours, in part
because ghrelin rises to high levels. This leads to overconsumption of calories at lunch,
dinner, and prior to bedtime, all driving further obesity.
Even though oxidation of fats (see
chapter 10
) liberates a lot of energy, a little bit of
energy is spent making it work. Another way to take advantage of TEF to is to consume
some form of protein at breakfast. Burning protein costs more energy than burning other
foodstuffs.

 Protein does not stimulate insulin to the same extent as carbohydrates do,
and increases satiety better than other nutrients. So consuming some protein at breakfast
is a smart and very defensible practice. People who eat veggie omelets at breakfast are
way less hungry at lunchtime.

Physical Activity
Finally, physical activity. You can be completely sedentary, or you can be Olympic
swimmer Michael Phelps. The range of energy expenditure by physical activity that
humans can achieve is quite remarkable; topped perhaps only by how many calories
can be eaten. Phelps eats everything in sight, on the order of 12,000 calories a day. As
hard as he works, he doesn’t expend 12,000 calories in physical activity—even
marathon runners don’t burn that kind of energy. The Cleveland Clinic Center for
Consumer Health estimates that a 130-pound runner will burn 2,224 calories during a
marathon, a 165-pound runner will burn 2,822 calories, and a 210-pound runner will
burn 3,593 calories. Yet Phelps can eat anything he wants, and he doesn’t gain weight.
That’s because exercise increases the number of mitochondria in the form of increased
muscle. And increased muscle means you burn more energy at rest. So Michael Phelps
has a higher REE than you do. And that’s why exercise is good; because it builds
muscle, and muscle burns energy even at rest.
Physical activity is the most misunderstood aspect of obesity medicine. People
think if they exercise they will lose weight. That’s a pipe dream. Most of the studies of
exercise for obesity in children are free-range community interventions and use either
weight or BMI as their outcome. And no amount of exercise is going to change BMI, a
measure of body size, because BMI is the wrong outcome. In the absence of
environmental control, caloric
intake will increase to meet the shortfall. Remember,
your subcutaneous fat can actually be good for you. But as discussed in
chapter 8
, the
target of exercise is muscle and bone.
What Exercise Actually Does
So, if you’re not going to lose weight, why go to spin class? Why is exercise so good
for you? Diet is about pounds, exercise is about inches. Diet is about weight, exercise
is about health. Exercise does the one thing that dietary restriction cannot: it builds
muscle. This is a poorly understood concept, because most people, including clinicians,
equate BMI with body fat. BMI does not take into account the difference between
muscle and fat, or the difference between subcutaneous and visceral fat. Several studies
have examined body composition before and after long-term exercise. What they show
is that percentage body fat declined. Absolutely true. But it’s because muscle increased.
And, in the process, metabolic status improved—both because visceral fat went down
(a little) and because muscle went up (a lot) (see
chapter 8
).
You
want
 to improve your insulin sensitivity—and exercise does just that. It makes
you build muscle at the expense of visceral and especially liver fat. But you can’t see
this by stepping on a scale. By improving insulin sensitivity and lowering insulin
levels, exercise improves leptin signaling, thereby increasing your sympathetic tone
(see
chapter 4
), energy expenditure, and quality of life.
And these metabolic improvements translate into disease prevention. A study of
thirty-eight thousand American men showed that physical activity was more potent in
preventing heart disease than being normal weight.

 But what about the ultimate
outcome: does exercise promote longevity? A recent study out of Taiwan looking at the
death rates of over four hundred thousand subjects suggests that moderate-intensity
exercise for fifteen minutes a day could increase lifespan by as much as three years,
even in patients with known heart disease.

 And they didn’t control for diet; if they had,
they would have seen an even greater effect of exercise on longevity. Given that 15
minutes a day accounts for only 91 waking hours a year,
or 273 hours in 3 years, a 3-
year life extension for 273 hours of exercise performed is a pretty darn good trade.
The Biochemistry of Exercise
Exercise is truly the other half of the antidote. It will not cure obesity, but it goes a long
way toward mitigating all its negative effects, especially those of metabolic syndrome
(see
chapter 9
). Biochemically, exercise does three things:
1.   Exercise directly activates your sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (see
chapter

). The SNS sends a signal to your muscles to make new mitochondria, which means
that more energy (glucose or fatty acids) can be burned. The age of mitochondria plays
a big role, because old mitochondria are inefficient, “leaky,” and make more ROS (see
chapter 9
), which contributes to insulin resistance. Exercise clears away those old
mitochondria, allowing for clean, efficient use of energy by muscles.

 This improves
muscle insulin sensitivity, which is key to improving your general metabolic health.
2.   Exercise is your internal stress reducer. Britt became a well-adjusted teenager
(not always an oxymoron) in part because he started to work out. While blood cortisol
levels (see
chapter 6
) rise immediately upon exercise (as they are part of the process
that keeps your blood sugar and blood pressure up), they come down quickly, and stay
down the rest of the day.

 To reduce your blood pressure, you may want to consider
exercise—not because your weight will go down, but because exercising will reduce
your stress levels and release endorphins (feel-good chemicals in your brain) to make
you feel better throughout the day. This is how runners get their “runner’s high.” We
want to keep our cortisol levels low to improve our long-term metabolic status. A little
pain, a lot of gain.
3.   Perhaps most important, exercise increases the speed of your liver’s Krebs
cycle (see
chapters 9
 and

) and makes it burn energy cleaner.

 This determines how
much energy will be shuttled out of the mitochondria and converted to liver fat. Four
factors have been shown to speed up the liver’s Krebs cycle: cold, altitude, the thyroid
hormone (we gave extra thyroid
hormone to obese women back in the 1960s and it
made them crazy), and exercise. Cold and altitude are a potent anti-obesity
combination. Take the difference between Switzerland and Germany. Switzerland eats
virtually the same diet as does Germany. Fat and carbohydrate together, an obesogenic
diet if I ever saw one. Lots of potatoes, lots of bread, lots of cheese, lots of cream
sauces, lots of beer. Yum. Their rates of physical activity are also virtually the same.
But Switzerland is high, cold, and thin (only 8 percent obesity), while Germany is low,
less cold, and fat (16 percent obesity). Same thing in Colorado: you’re so proud
because the CDC obesity map shows that you’re the least obese state in the United
States. But I know the real reason you’ve lagged behind the rest of the country, and it
isn’t your food or your active lifestyle—it’s your geography. So, everyone, if you don’t
want to exercise, move to Switzerland or Colorado!
Cardio or Isometric Exercise?
Assuming you’re a mere mortal at sea level and not an Olympian on a mountain, what
kind of exercise should you perform to get the health benefits? The standard mantra was
that low-intensity, long-interval exercise, otherwise known as “cardio” (e.g., running),
worked your heart and provided all the cardiovascular benefits. There were even those
who eschewed resistance or isometric exercise because it temporarily reduced the
blood flow to the heart, thus slowing it, and because it increased peripheral muscle, it
did not promote weight loss. But recent prospective studies show that high-intensity
interval training (fits of extreme activity interspersed with low levels of exercise)

 or
even strength training (weight lifting)

 provide equal improvements in waist
circumference and blood vessel flow. So, don’t sweat what kind of exercise, just
sweat!
It’s All Good, Except When It’s Not
Of course, you can overdo exercise. Exercise promotes the release of chemicals called
“endogenous opioids,” or “endorphins,” which cause
the hypothalamus to reduce the
release of the pituitary hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH), which reduces estrogen production by the ovaries. In women, this
leads to the stoppage of menses and long-term reductions in bone mass—not a good
thing, given that women are destined to lose bone mass rapidly upon menopause.
When obese patients start to exercise, they may be at significant risk for injury
because of the excess weight they are carrying. The obese need to exercise to improve
their overall health, but they need to start out slowly, because they are at greater risk for
muscle strains and pulls as well as fractures. Studies demonstrate that the fracture rate
among the obese is four times higher than the general population.

And the biggest problem of all: the beneficial effects of exercise, while excellent
for your body and your metabolism, are relatively short-lived, and have to be frequent
and sustained. Studies demonstrate that levels of PPAR-gamma coactivator 1-alpha
(PGC-1α; the protein in muscle cells that turns on all the good muscle metabolic effects
and tells the mitochondria to divide) decline within a day of cessation of exercise, and
insulin sensitivity returns to baseline within fifteen days.

 So, those of you weekend
warriors who think you’re doing yourself some good—it may not be as good as you
think. If you’re going to use exercise as your protection against chronic disease, you’ll
have to be consistent about it.
Fat and Fit Is Better Than Thin and Sick
Exercise is the other half of the antidote. It is your best defense against metabolic
dysfunction. Here’s another way to look at it. Every molecule of energy that you absorb
has one of three fates: First, you can burn it, in which case your insulin doesn’t rise, you
won’t gain weight, and you won’t do metabolic damage. Second, you can store it, in
which case your insulin goes up, you gain weight, and you do some metabolic damage.
Or third, the energy goes out in your urine, in which case you wreak complete
metabolic havoc and cause kidney damage, as seen in poorly controlled diabetics who
end up on dialysis. Burning energy is always preferable to the other two
options. Just
don’t expect exercise to induce weight loss, unless it is coupled with some sort of
dietary intervention as well.
So let’s go back to
chapters 1
 and

, where I mentioned that 40 percent of normal-
weight individuals are insulin resistant or have metabolic syndrome, and those who do
also have fatty livers. Who do you think is better off? The fat person who exercises, or
the thin one who watches nonstop
Law & Order
 marathons? Recent studies have
demonstrated that fitness mitigates all the negative effects of obesity on visceral fat,

health complaints,

 and longevity.

 So does the fat and fit person deserve to be
discriminated against? As long as she keeps it up, she’ll likely live longer than the stick
thin model on the cover of
Vogue
. Indeed, overweight people with BMIs between 25
and 30 live longer than thin people with BMIs of less than 19.

The Greatest Disservice, and by the Medical Profession
Nonetheless, doctors continue to promote the party line with their obese patients. The
corollary to “
a calorie is a calorie
” is the mantra “If you’d only exercise, you’d lose
weight.” Not only is this wrong, it’s downright detrimental. Patients who monitor their
exercise progress on a home scale are destined for disappointment. But their doctors
tell them it will work, and the patients trust them. So they think they’re failures, get
depressed, and stop exercising and start eating, because they think it’s no use. A great
way to make metabolic syndrome even worse. Irrespective of weight, consistent
exercise (even just fifteen minutes a day) is the single best way for people to improve
their health. That’s 273 hours paid in for 3 years of life gained, or a 64,000 percent
return on investment. The best deal in all of medicine.
Chapter 14
N
Micronutrients: Home Run or Hyperbole?
Julio is a fifteen-year-old Latino male from West Texas who weighs
400 pounds. He is Med-Flighted to San Francisco for an emergency
liver transplant because his pathology shows severe fatty liver and
scarring, known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with cirrhosis,
a condition associated with severe alcohol abuse. Although he has never
consumed alcohol, he has imbibed at least a half-gallon of Coca-Cola
every day since he was old enough to open the refrigerator. Julio’s
transplant is successful, and he is discharged two weeks later, after
being told to lose weight, stop drinking soda, and improve his diet. One
year later, Julio is seen back at UCSF for a checkup. His diet hasn’t
changed, the soft drinks continue, his weight has not declined, and an
ultrasound shows fatty deposits in his new liver.
o doubt Julio’s new liver will suffer the same fate. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) is now the most common disease in America, affecting 45 percent of all
Latinos, 33 percent of all Caucasians, and 24 percent of all African Americans, fat and
thin. Considering this disease was not even described until 1980, the increase in
prevalence to encompass one third of the entire adult population is astounding. Most of
the people with NAFLD have no symptoms and don’t even know they have it. The
majority of them will suffer no ill effects. But 5 percent of them will go on to develop
NASH, with inflammation and scarring of the liver. And
of those, 25 percent will
develop cirrhosis, which will lead either to death or to a liver transplant, just as with
Julio. When you do the math, that’s one million Americans dying from a nutritional
disease; never mind all those who die from other complications of metabolic syndrome.
Considering that this disease is completely preventable, this is a travesty. But is this an
overnutritional
 disease or an
undernutritional
 disease? Both, as it turns out.
While there are certain genetic predispositions (accounting for the higher
prevalence in Latinos), you still need the excess energy coursing through the liver to
develop the disease. Cue the sugar glut. We aren’t certain why the disease affects some
severely, while remaining benign in others. There are several theories. Remember our
biological enemies, the reactive oxygen species (ROS; see
chapter 9
)? Those whose
livers can’t quench (detoxify) their ROS will progress on to NASH. ROSs damage
lipids and proteins within the cell, which can cause cell structural damage or cell
death. Removal of ROSs before they can do damage is the job of a subcellular structure
called the peroxisome, which is where ROSs go to die. The chemicals that do the dirty
work of knocking them off are known as antioxidants.
The “Triage Hypothesis”
It’s been over a hundred years since we discovered the link between vitamin B

 and
beriberi, a disease of cardiac and neurological degeneration. William Fletcher
discovered that eating polished rice stripped of its fiber caused the disease, while
eating unpolished rice prevented it. Since then, we’ve learned of many vitamin or
mineral deficiencies that lead to specific individual diseases with funny names (e.g.,
scurvy, pellagra). Fortunately, virtually all these micronutrient deficiency diseases have
been essentially wiped out in America—either through the abundance of micronutrients
in our diet or through specific supplementation in foods (such as giving folic acid to
pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects in newborns). The concept that the
diseases of metabolic syndrome might be due to inadequate micronutrient availability
has been spurred on by animal studies and small-scale
human studies. Nonetheless, the
search for the “magic supplement” to reverse metabolic syndrome continues with
fervor.
Enter Bruce Ames at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, who has been
working in the field of nutrition for fifty years. He has put forward the “triage
hypothesis” to explain our current metabolic dilemma. The premise is simple: Cells
want to survive. Virtually every biochemical reaction requires one micronutrient or
other, whether it is a vitamin, mineral, or biochemical compound. When micronutrients
are in short supply, they are triaged to these reactions to maintain cell viability. Their
relative deficiency then deprives secondary reactions, which are less important to
short-term survival but crucial for long-term cell integrity. DNA or protein damage that
goes unrepaired can lead to either cancer formation or cell death. According to the
triage hypothesis, acute micronutrient deficiency leads to one set of diseases (e.g.,
scurvy), while relative micronutrient insufficiency leads to another set of diseases (e.g.,
metabolic syndrome).
I Used to Care, but Now I Take a Pill for That…
As our collective health has declined over the past thirty years, the imperative to find
the magic bullet that will forgive our previous indiscretions has only heightened. This
has created the approximately $100 billion industry of “nutraceuticals.” Currently,
more than 50 percent of America takes at least one form of nutritional supplement,
hedging their bets. A trip to the local health food store or pharmacy will overwhelm
even the most seasoned vitamin aficionado with options. Do any of these supplements
exert any benefits? Maybe it doesn’t matter, since 71 percent of users say their belief is
so strong that they will continue to consume the nutraceutical even if studies
demonstrate a lack of efficacy.
Antioxidants: The Fountains of Youth?
Almost every advertisement for breakfast cereal shows the bowl dressed with a handful
of blueberries. Perhaps this is to draw your attention away from the fact that the
antioxidants in the cereal have been processed out and that the only way to rescue your
meal is to supplement them back in the form of fresh berries. No doubt, more color
means more antioxidants, and fruits and vegetables are packed with them. Antioxidants
allow the plant to buffer the damage from its own ROSs when making its carbohydrates
from photosynthesis. Can consuming them help us to battle our own?
There’s growing literature that “oxidative stress,” or the damage caused by ROSs,
is the single most important factor contributing to the aging process. Different tissues
generate ROSs by different means. Therefore, disparate antioxidants are required to
help quench them to prevent various types of chronic diseases. Antioxidants come in
many shapes and sizes, many of which have been considered as treatments for
metabolic syndrome.

 The antioxidants vitamins C and E protect against lipid
peroxidation (as in potato chips when they go rancid), though neither has been shown to
improve vascular function or insulin resistance. In fact, high-dose vitamin E has been
linked to increased rates of mortality.

 Although there are occasional “hits” among the
treatment of metabolic diseases with antioxidants, most are near misses.
Vitamin D—The “Great Impostor”?
By far, the most enticing yet unrealized hope for the magic bullet that will cure all our
ills is vitamin D. More has been written about this compound than all other vitamins,
minerals, and supplements combined. Deficiency of vitamin D can occur either from
lack of sunlight (which makes vitamin D in the skin) or lack of vitamin D in the diet.
Vitamin D is certainly a godsend for children who suffer from rickets, a debilitating
bone disease and seizure disorder due to a lack of vitamin D. We learned back in the
1920s that a teaspoon of castor oil (made from salmon liver) cured rickets,
though we
didn’t know why (much to the chagrin of the children forced to swallow it). In the
1950s it was discovered that a teaspoon of castor oil contained 400 units of vitamin D,
so this became the dogma: we need 400 units of vitamin D per day (although recent
studies suggest we need as much as 800 per day).
Could low vitamin D be at the heart of our chronic metabolic problems? Many
scientists subscribe to this idea, and a subset of them have gone out on a limb to stake
their claim to vitamin D as the cure-all for chronic metabolic disease. There is no doubt
that vitamin D levels correlate inversely with all the core diseases associated with
metabolic syndrome: diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. But why is one third of
America vitamin D deficient anyway? One reason is that we have been taught to avoid
the sun like the plague. The second reason is that per capita consumption of milk, the
primary source of dietary vitamin D, has declined by half over the past sixty years.
Commensurate with the decline in milk consumption is the increase in sugar-sweetened
beverages (soda and juice). You can’t untie the two with epidemiologic data, which is
all we have so far. So which is the cause of metabolic syndrome? The dearth of vitamin
D, the glut of sugar, or a combination of the two? Currently, not one study examines
vitamin D levels and sugar consumption at the same time to determine which is the
primary cause of metabolic syndrome and which is secondary.

Resveratrol: The New “It” Compound
Perhaps the single biggest blockbuster in the field of nutraceuticals is in trials right
now. Not since gingko biloba has a nutraceutical been so highly touted as has
resveratrol, a compound found in small amounts in food but in high amounts in red
wine. (Yes, you
can
 have it all!) But this one has some staying power because of its
mechanism of action in the right part of the cell. In animal models, resveratrol has
shown beneficial effects on reducing inflammation produced by ROSs and, by doing so,
preventing cancer, reducing atherosclerosis, reducing visceral fat, improving insulin
sensitivity, and possibly even preserving neuronal function—all with virtually no side
effects. The problem is that human studies are just
getting started, and so far have been
short term only. The most recent review

 suggests that while promising, resveratrol is
not yet ready for prime time.
Contenders or Pretenders?
Many epidemiologic studies demonstrate correlations between low blood levels of
antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene and the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome. But are these micronutrient deficiencies the true cause of disease or just
markers of an extremely bad diet? At this point, we just don’t know. We know that
altering
diet
 (eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting processed foods and sugar) to
deliver more of these compounds is almost uniformly beneficial in improving the signs
and symptoms of metabolic syndrome. But when these antioxidants are given as
supplements, they usually fail miserably. This could very well be due to the beneficial
effects of eating unprocessed foods, where you get both the fiber and the antioxidants as
a bonus.
In clinical trials, vitamin E supplementation has flamed out not once but five
separate times: (1) in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention
(ATBC) study, in which beta-carotene (the orange stuff in carrots and the precursor to
vitamin A) and vitamin E given to heavy smokers increased their risk for cancer and
ischemic heart disease; (2) in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Education (HOPE) Trial
of 2005, in which vitamin E contributed to heart failure; (3) in the Women’s Health
Initiative of 2005, in which ten years of vitamin E showed no benefit on heart disease
or cancer; (4) in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) of
2009, in which the vitamin E group increased their risk for prostate cancer; and (5) in a
2008 Cochrane meta-analysis, in which vitamin E did not alter the rate of cognitive
decline.
The Iowa Women’s Health Study has provided the most recent stake through the
heart for the dietary supplement movement.

 This long-term and well-controlled study
showed slightly
increased
 risk of death with several dietary supplements (particularly
iron). Of all of them, the only long-term benefit was found by taking calcium, which
improved longevity through fewer broken bones. But you never hear about these
failures, because no agency publicizes them and there is no pressure to remove the
supplements from the market.
This is a real dilemma. Micronutrients matter—the biochemistry says so—except
they don’t work when provided as supplements in clinical trials. How many studies do
we need? Now you’re ready for the dénouement: Real food, containing endogenous
micronutrients, prevents metabolic syndrome. Processed food causes metabolic
syndrome. And nutritional supplements can’t reverse that which has previously been
destroyed.

 So why does real food work while supplements don’t?
The Right Stuff: Real versus Manufactured
Face it, we got spoiled by previous successes. All the classic vitamins work to cure
their respective nutritional deficiencies, even when they are supplied in a pill. Perhaps
because the only thing that’s wrong is the undernutrition, the vitamin deficiency itself.
But metabolic syndrome is far more complicated. Treating overnutrition is a much
tougher nut to crack. Replacing something that’s missing is a whole lot easier than
taking away something that’s in excess. Kind of like pudding. You can always put it
back on the stove. But once overcooked, you might as well throw it away. There are
five theories as to why:
1.   Various items added during the processing of food, such as sugar and other
preservatives, are even more toxic than we think (see
chapter 12
). Something
that ubiquitous and potent may just dwarf the beneficial effects of any nutritional
supplement.
2.   The processing of food removes something even more valuable than the
micronutrients, which remain un-replaced. Could there be something else in real
food that is missing in processed food? Could it be the fiber itself? Could fiber
be the real antidote to metabolic syndrome while everything else is just window
dressing?
3.   The simple act of food processing removes the food’s native micronutrients,
just as the fiber is stripped. After all, many micronutrients travel with the fiber.
Recall the beriberi story—it was
the polished rice, stripped of its fiber, that
lost its native vitamin B

. Flavonoids, folate, and many other micronutrients are
decimated by food processing. While it’s enticing to think that we can put them
back with a pill, the data support that once a food is “biologically” dead, it’s
unlikely that you can revive it with a sprinkling of a nutraceutical.
4.   Some antioxidants when furnished in high supply are instead oxidants,
performing the opposite effect. The perfect example of this is iron. Iron is
needed to make all the scavenger enzymes work, but too much iron brings its
own level of oxidation—it’s called rust, which like the “browning reaction,”
occurs inside you as well.
5.   Nutraceutical supplements aren’t subject to the same rigorous quality control
standards as pharmaceuticals. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education
Act of 1994, passed by Congress, virtually assured the nutraceutical industry a
free pass on demonstrating both safety and efficacy of their products. In 2008
the IOM crafted lower limits for these substances, but no tolerable upper intake
limits—which means that companies don’t have to assure potency. Can you
assure consistency from one batch to the next? Can you even assure that the
native plant was accurately identified and put in the correct supplement? And
does consuming 1,000 percent of your USDA recommended daily allowance of
vitamin C have any demonstrable effects on fighting the common cold? The only
way that the industry has gotten away with this so far is that the FDA doesn’t
regulate them.
One thing’s for sure: the $123.9 billion (in 2008) nutraceutical industry, accounting
for 6 percent of all food dollars, is a house of cards. Better to go with the tried-and-true
answer to combat metabolic syndrome. We know it works, it has even more positive
effects for our bodies, it’s a lot cheaper, and it tastes better. So what is this magic
bullet? Unfortunately for Julio, it’s not a new liver. Rather, it’s called
real food
.
Chapter 15
I
Environmental “Obesogens”
Rebecca is a five-year-old girl who has gained 20 pounds in one year
and is referred to us for premature breast development. An MRI of her
head rules out a brain tumor. A pituitary evaluation to look for the onset
of puberty is unrevealing, and tests show no estrogen in the blood. A
more detailed history reveals that Rebecca’s mother has recently taken
to bathing her daughter in Victoria’s Secret bath gel. The bottle says in
large block lettering, “
FOR ADULTS ONLY.
” The assumption is that the
bath gel contains a plant estrogen. The mother is counseled to stop the
bath gel, and subsequently Rebecca’s weight gain and breast
development both cease.
n 1990 no U.S. state had an obesity rate higher than 14 percent. In just twenty years,
not one state is absolved from having a population with a lower obesity rate than 20
percent; thirty-six states have a prevalence of 25 percent or more. These numbers
continue to climb, with no signs of abating. Perhaps the most bizarre thing about the
obesity pandemic is its spread over time. To think that this national trend is purely a
mass alteration in behavioral change, state by state, is to ignore the pattern of this
pandemic. Rather, it is more akin to an infectious disease, a contagion, or some other
mass environmental exposure. But what can have that effect and that sort of reach?
The Obesity/Puberty Dilemma
One of the issues that directed attention to the childhood obesity epidemic, and the
possibility of some grand and overwhelming exposure, is the fact that girls have been
starting puberty at increasingly younger ages.

 Understandably, this is causing parents
undue distress. Studies have demonstrated that, across ethnicities, girls are exhibiting
breast development as young as seven years of age: Caucasians (10 percent), African
Americans (23 percent), and Latinos (15 percent).

 Many studies have since
corroborated the finding of earlier-onset puberty in girls (but not in boys; we don’t
know why). Coinciding with the epidemic of early breast development in girls is the
epidemic of obesity. Could the two be related? Could it be that the breast development
(and perhaps also obesity) is not being caused by the ovary (true puberty), but rather
some kind of estrogen exposure?
For hundreds of years the timing of puberty in girls has been advancing earlier and
earlier. This advancement has been attributed to improved nutrition and increased
weight and fat at younger ages. Higher BMI clearly predicts earlier menarche,

 which
suggests that obesity may be the culprit of the recent early-onset puberty. Furthermore,
we know that children who constantly exercise vigorously and don’t gain weight, such
as gymnasts and ballet dancers (many of whom also suffer from eating disorders),
won’t enter puberty at all until they slow down. In addition, their growth is often
stunted. This is a perfect example of how the hormone leptin is a permissive factor in
the onset and progression of puberty; you have to gain a certain amount of fat to
generate the leptin needed to start the process—no leptin, no puberty.

Due to all this obesity, leptin levels are increasing at younger ages—but is puberty
really occurring as early as age seven or not? We’re still not sure how to interpret the
data because there are two questions that have yet to be answered. First, is the
appearance of breast tissue in girls always a true sign of the onset of puberty? Could it
just be fat tissue making the breasts look bigger? You would have to palpate (feel) the
breast tissue to be sure; and many of these studies used visual inspection only. (Many
doctors feel uncomfortable palpating the breasts of young girls.) Second, how do we
know that breast development truly means that puberty has begun? This is
not always
clear because it depends on the source of the estrogen, and we don’t always know
where the estrogen is coming from.
Three sources of estrogen can promote breast development: First, the ovary—when
the hypothalamus gets the leptin signal, it can allow the pubertal process to begin.
Second, the fat cells, which have the enzyme that makes estrogen—the more fat, the
more estrogen. This is true in both women and men (hence obese men get “man boobs”
and sometimes need the “manzierre”). Third, any chemical in the environment that
resembles estrogen, which could induce breast tissue formation and fat storage. A
chemical that disrupts the endocrine system. An
environmental obesogen
.
What Is an Obesogen?
Scientists have coined the term
obesogen
 to refer to any endocrine-disrupting chemical
(EDC) that promotes weight gain and obesity in people. Obesogens can promote
obesity in various ways. Like estrogen, they can increase the number of, or promote fat
storage into, existing fat cells. Obesogens can alter energy balance to favor the storage
of calories and reduce the amount of calories burned at rest (REE; see
chapter 13
).
They can change the mechanisms through which the body experiences appetite or
satiety. In other words, obesogens can insidiously hijack the body’s energy balance
system, making energy go places that are detrimental to your metabolic health.
Estrogens
It doesn’t take much for any chemical to be an estrogen. The human estrogen receptor is
extraordinarily promiscuous; it’ll hook up with just about any chemical that strikes its
fancy. And there loads of chemicals that make the estrogen receptor go wild and lose
all its inhibitions, promoting breast development and inducing fat cell differentiation,
which means weight gain as well.
Estrogens are
everywhere
. They are in our food, our plastics,
and our water supply.
Until recently they were used in our pesticides. Perhaps the most famous of these
compounds is the pesticide DDT. Used in great abundance during World War II to
control malaria and typhus among the troops, this chemical worked to kill off insects
because it was an estrogen. Rachel Carson’s 1962 book
Silent Spring
 indicated that
DDT was a cause of animal disease and human cancer. The pesticide was banned in the
United States in 1972 and in Mexico in 1997. Here’s the kicker: DDT has been absent
from the United States for four decades, yet its metabolite DDE can still be found in the
urine of pregnant women, even those who were born
after
 1972. Among the many
implications for health, the concentration of DDE in pregnant women’s urine predicts
the weight of their children at age three.

 Almost assuredly, DDE is creating extra fat
cells before the baby is even born! Could this be driving childhood obesity?
Another well-known estrogen is our newest environmental bogeyman, bisphenol-A,
or BPA. This compound is leeched out every time an acid touches a polycarbonate
plastic bottle. In other words, every consumable liquid in America. BPA is used in a
multitude of commercial products. The BPA-cancer link is strong enough that the state
of California has passed a ban of BPA in baby bottles and kids’ toys that will go into
effect in 2013. BPA is associated with fat cell differentiation, and urine BPA
concentrations are correlated with BMI in adults.

 But remember, correlation is
not
causation.
The last of our big-time estrogen exposures is genistein, a soy and alfalfa estrogen.
Genistein drives fat cell differentiation in rats; exposure at birth predicts increased fat
deposition at three and four months. And because it’s in soy, it’s in everything we eat.
Even if you’re a carnivore, the meat you consume will be from animals that were fed
soy products. If you are a vegetarian, you’ll still be ingesting it in your milk and cheese.
And vegans are likely eating lots of soy products anyway (e.g., tofu), so no one is
immune. Whether genistein contributes to human obesity is still unknown, and the data
are being collected now. However, given the ubiquity of soy products in our food
supply, it’s still a cause for concern.
Phthalates
Like that new shower curtain smell? Those are phthalates, plasticizers that render
plastics soft and pliable. Phthalates are used in a large variety of items, from the
coatings on pharmaceutical pills and nutritional supplements to personal care products,
to children’s products such as rubber duckies. In adults, urine phthalate levels correlate
with adiposity, waist circumference, and insulin resistance. And most recently,
phthalate levels in the urine correlated with waist circumference in New York City
children.

Again, while this is correlation and not causation, it is still highly worrisome.
Atrazine and Other Organochlorines
Atrazine is an example of an organochlorine, a pesticide that is highly teratogenic, that
is, causing structural malformations in living things (e.g., tadpoles). This has
implications for human developmental abnormalities and childhood cancer. Atrazine
use has been banned in Europe but not in the United States. Iowa is awash in atrazine
because it is the chief pesticide for the state’s corn crop. For the past two decades,
there has been a “dead zone” in the northern Gulf of Mexico, killing nearly all the fish
in the Delta, due to the atrazine runoff down the Mississippi River. Blood atrazine
levels correlate with adiposity and insulin resistance in adults. But again, showing that
atrazine
causes
 human obesity is still a long way off.
Tributyltin (TBT)
Tributyltin, or TBT, is not a well-known compound, but it is particularly egregious
when it comes to obesity. TBT is a fungicide, used in painting ships to prevent rotting
and keep barnacles from sticking to the hull. Because it’s on boats, it’s also in our
general water supply, meaning that everyone is exposed to it. When it comes to making
fat, TBT does double duty.

 First, it mimics the signals that tell fat cells to multiply; and
second,
it activates cortisol metabolism so that more visceral fat accumulates (see
chapter 6
). Bad news all around. Worse yet, a single exposure for a pregnant rat
promotes fatty liver in her offspring right at birth, dooming them to a lifetime of obesity
and metabolic syndrome. Although we can measure TBT in human urine (so we know
we’re exposed), the jury is still out as to whether TBT is a primary driver of obesity in
either children or adults.
Smoking and Air Pollution
Everyone knows that smoking is bad news. Yet despite Surgeon General Luther Terry
declaring that smoking was harmful to health in 1964, it took thirty years for society to
care enough to do anything about it. Why has society enacted these changes now?
Thanks to the rights of the nonsmoker, we now have no-smoking laws in public
buildings. All this because of secondhand smoke. And no one suffers more than the
unborn child.
Cigarette smoke harbors a host of ugly compounds, one of which is thiocyanate, a
relative of cyanide. Thiocyanate inhibits the function of the thyroid gland and is known
to reduce thyroid levels in school-age children whose parents smoke. This might alter
cognitive performance in school. Worse yet, thiocyanate crosses the placenta to the
fetus and is also found in breast milk. Cigarette smoking is a well-known cause of SGA
(small for gestational age) in newborns and, as elaborated on in
chapter 7
, SGA infants
are at high risk for developing obesity and metabolic syndrome in later life.
But the chemicals you breathe in every day could be even more insidious than
someone else’s smoke. One of the most sobering associations, and one that may play a
huge role in the worldwide obesity and diabetes pandemics, is air pollution. There is
no question that obesity and diabetes rates have increased progressively in
industrialized countries. The counterpart to the “
a calorie is a calorie
” argument is that
we now drive everywhere instead of walk, so we don’t burn the energy. Another dogma
to be shattered. We’ve long known that asthma, obesity, and diabetes like to congregate
in the same individual. Several new studies have shown that living near freeways or
other highways is a major risk factor for developing all
three. A long-term study of ten-
year-olds in Southern California showed that the level of traffic within 150 meters of a
child’s home predicted that child’s BMI by age eighteen.

 What is not clear is whether
the air quality had direct effects, or whether the degree of traffic altered the child’s
level of physical activity and thus promoted weight gain.
Or Is It an Infection?
This whole book is about the obesity
pandemic
—and a pandemic it is. But when we
talk about pandemics, we’re usually talking about some contagion such as influenza,
plague, ebola, or something equally movie-worthy. The pattern of obesity propagation
looks like some grand exposure. Could it be due to some sort of infection?
Enter adenovirus-36 (Ad-36). This virus starts by giving you standard cold
symptoms and then takes over your fat cells. Ad-36 does just what some of these EDCs
do: it differentiates your fat cells and makes them divide. Standard transmission studies
have shown that infection of monkeys with Ad-36 makes them gain weight. And like any
other adenovirus (respiratory infections), Ad-36 is contagious through coughing and
sneezing. For obvious reasons, proving causation in humans is a little harder to do.
However, Ad-36 antibody levels correlate with BMI in certain populations,
particularly in children.

 In one study, 15 percent of obese children were Ad-36-
positive, compared to 7 percent of normal-weight children. But
within
 the obese
population, those who were Ad-36-positive weighed, on average, 35 pounds more than
those who were not. This suggests that Ad-36 might make the obese get obeser. But all
these correlations are still not causation. We have a long way to go before we can
prove that Ad-36 is a bona fide contributor to human obesity.
You Can Run, but You Can’t Hide
I could go on—the list of offending agents seems endless. And of course, let’s not
forget the most ubiquitous toxin of them all: fructose, the Evil Queen/Witch of this
story, peddling the poison we just can’t get enough of.
No one can escape. These EDCs are everywhere. We’ve got toxins in the water,
plastics, grocery store, and in the very air we breathe. Rebecca may have been affected
by obesogens in her bath gel. Indeed, even animal species that drink our water, breathe
our air, and eat chow made from the same adulterated foodstuffs (corn, soy) are also
getting fatter

 (see
chapter 3
).
You still don’t want to try to argue that obesity is due to gluttony and sloth, do you?
The obesogen hypothesis makes two important points. First, susceptibility to
obesity is part of the human (and animal) condition. These chemicals
love
 to make fat
cells, and fat cells
love
 to get filled. Second, obesogens can alter developmental
programming of fat cells or the hypothalamus
in utero
, and thus change the set point for
gaining weight as early as birth. Even though the exposure might end, the damage
appears to last forever. And there are more of them around today than ever before.
Finally, back to our obese six-month-old. Soy infant formulas are packed with these
compounds, and consuming soy formula is a well-known contributor to weight gain.
The formula Isomil is 10.3 percent sucrose (Coca-Cola is 10.5 percent sucrose). It’s a
baby milkshake! Add to that the genistein in the soy formula, and put all that in a baby
bottle containing bisphenol-A. Is that six-month-old looking more like a perpetrator or
victim?
How can we reduce our exposure to EDCs? Sadly, reducing such environmental
exposure usually requires governmental legislation and public health intervention. Does
any government agency have the stomach for that? We’ll address the public health
implications of the obesity pandemic in
Part 6
.
Chapter 16
S
The “Empire” Strikes Back:
Response of the Food Industry
“Obesity is a complex problem with many causes and no single, easy
solution. It is irresponsible and scientifically spurious to single out
HFCS or any other food or ingredient as the chief cause of obesity. The
only effective and lasting way to combat obesity is to encourage people
to live a balanced lifestyle, eating a variety of foods in moderation and
incorporating lots of physical activity into their daily lives.”
—National Soft Drink Association press release, March 25, 2004
ort of. HFCS and sucrose are, for all intents and purposes, biochemically and
metabolically equivalent. But the truth stops there. Both the Sugar Association and the
Corn Refiners Association have gone out of their way in their attempts to exonerate
sugar, whatever the source. They want the public to think that “
a calorie is a calorie
.”
They want us to believe that fructose—and, by inference, all sugar—is just “empty
calories.” If it were, then sugar would be the same as—no better, no worse than—any
other nutrient. In their view, for a standard sedentary adult consuming 2,000 calories
per day, approximately 1,800 calories are “essential” calories, in that they are directed
to producing lipids for cell membranes, protein for muscles and enzymes, and
carbohydrates for normal energy metabolism, growth, and repair. This leaves about 200
calories per day as “discretionary calories,” which can be spent any way we want.

And if we exercise, we have the capacity to consume an even higher number of
discretionary calories.
If we want to use them all on sugar, then we should have the
choice to do so. And we do—and then some.
Figure 16.1
 shows the number of calories per day of added sugar eaten by children
in different age groups in the United States. The fiftieth percentile consumes between
320 and 350 calories of sugar per day throughout their life span, and the ninetieth
percentile consumes above 600 calories. Even the two- to three-year-old age group is
consuming an average of 180 calories per day in added sugar. We have far exceeded
our discretionary calorie limit; in fact, we’ve left it in our dust. The food industry
continues to add more sugar to processed foods because they can. And they know that
when they do, we will buy more (see
chapters 5
 and

). Soft drinks account for one
third of all the sugar consumed. But other foods that never had sugar before are now
busting at the seams from the sugar overload (e.g., yogurt, ketchup).
A Short History of the U.S. Sugar Glut
The U.S. sugar glut is the result of more political distortion and behind-the-scenes
manipulation than the 2000 Bush-Gore election. We’ve always had a “sweet tooth,” but
our consumption of sugar was not a problem until the second half of the twentieth
century. North America was consistently a sugar deficit area, requiring more imports
than exports to meet growing consumption needs. In chronological order, the events of
the past fifty years escalated the problem to bring us to the precipice of our current
public health collapse.

sugars (kilocalories per day) in U.S. children, broken down by age and sex. This comprises all foods, including cereals,
desserts, soda, and juice.

age and sex. All age groups are consuming more sugar than the upper limit of 10 percent of calories recommended by
the American Heart Association.
2.   High-fructose corn syrup began to hit our shores in the early 1970s. Initially, the
U.S. food industry was somewhat wary of this new product. The eventual
introduction of HFCS to the Western diet resulted in stability of the U.S.
Producer Price Index for sugar because the cost of HFCS, on average, is about
half that of sucrose (
figure 16.2
).
3.   President Richard Nixon astutely noted that fluctuating food prices foment
political unrest, and he directed his secretary of agriculture, Earl (Rusty) Butz,
to “take food off the table” as a
political issue. Butz’s job was to find ways to
make food cheap. HFCS fit the bill. This was one of the impetuses for
developing the corn subsidy as part of the Farm Bill. Basically, the U.S.
government would underwrite the cost of corn, even when it cost more to grow
it than to sell it. The low cost of HFCS drove down the price of both, making
both substances cheap and readily available.
4.   The McGovern Commission (see
chapter 10
) edict led to a directed policy on
the part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the late 1970s to reduce our
consumption of dietary fat.

 How do you make low-fat taste good? Add sugar.
HFCS was the cheapest alternative around, and homegrown to boot. In the
process of switching various processed foods to the low-fat, high-sugar
versions, the food industry found that its profits were increasing.
5.   The final nail in our coffin came from the second worst hurricane in our history.
Everyone remembers Katrina in 2005. Hurricane Allen in 1980 wiped out the
entire Caribbean sugar crop in one fell swoop. Sugar futures skyrocketed to
$0.55 a pound (a record for that era) and more than $1.00 per pound retail.
Coca-Cola, which had been holding out in terms of switching from sucrose to
HFCS, now saw a shortage of raw sugar and ushered an HFCS-containing
version onto supermarket shelves. The rest of the food industry quickly
followed suit.
In the late 1990s, HFCS became the most commonly used sweetener in the United
States. Currently, 5 percent of all the corn grown in this country is turned into HFCS.

HFCS is no worse for your health than other forms of fructose, though it is always
devoid of fiber. However, it’s cheap, easy to produce, and readily available—so it
now permeates nearly all our food. And we like it, so we buy more. While HFCS is
cheaper to produce than sugar, the prices on various foods containing it have remained
the same if not gotten higher. (Check out the price of a box of cereal.) A win-win for the
food industry.
Fig. 16.2. A Cheap Fix.
 a) The U.S. producer price index (PPI) for sugar before and after introduction of corn
sweeteners in 1975. Upon its introduction, PPI hovers, at 100%, which infers price stability. b) Price of U.S. sugar
compared to London price, documenting price stability and allowing for increased usage overseas. c) Price of refined
sugar compared to HFCS in the U.S. HFCS was so cheap, it started appearing in every food. And that’s where it
remains today.
The Food Industry’s Justification
The food industry will counter that there are many reasons to add sucrose or HFCS to
food and to remove the food’s fiber. And some of them are very reasonable, both
industrially and economically. But how about biologically? How about in terms of our
health?
Sugar Adds Sweetness
Our tongue is able to distinguish five tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and savory. Sugar
covers up the other four. It covers up salty (trail mix, honey roasted peanuts), sour (the
acidity in processed tomato sauce provided by less-than-ripe tomatoes, or lemonade),
bitter (milk chocolate), and savory (sweet-and-sour pork). Sugar covers up the
inequities of foods, making
not-so-tasty food seem like it is worth eating. Bottom line,
you can make pretty much anything taste good with enough sugar. And the food industry
does.
Sugar and Browning
The browning of foods is appealing to your eye and to your taste buds. We slather our
ribs in barbecue sauce before we cook or grill them, to get just the right browning
effect. All foods brown better with sugar. And the browning of meats provides a
smokier, tangier flavor. As discussed in
chapter 11
, the browning of food is the
Maillard reaction.

 While appealing on the plate and to the palate, it’s not so appealing
in your arteries.
Sugar Adds Texture
Baked goods wouldn’t be nearly as interesting without sugar. Try to make a cake with
Splenda. It will taste just as sweet, but it won’t puff up. In baked bread, the yeast needs
something to work on to give it its airiness. Conversely, wafer crackers wouldn’t be
crisp if it weren’t for sugar. Sugar provides viscosity (thickness) to various foods, such
as gummy bears. Sugar also provides the “glass” appearance and crunch of hard
candies. Furthermore, sugar lowers foods’ freezing point (which is essential for ice
cream to have that creamy consistency) and raises their boiling point (which makes
caramels chewy).
Sugar Stops Spoilage
Sugar reduces water activity, or the intensity with which water associates with solids.
The higher the water activity, the more easily bacteria and mold grow on food. And
easily moldy food means quicker spoilage. But sugar (and salt, for that matter) reduces
water activity, and makes it less likely that any given food will be able to spoil. This is
why the food industry uses sugar as a preservative. When was the last time you tasted a
rancid soft drink? Flat maybe, but never rancid. Nothing can grow in that bottle.
The addition of sugar to a food also adds humectancy, which is the ability to hold
on to water. This is extremely important for preventing your favorite treats from going
stale, particularly your baked goods. One way to gauge the effect of sugar on
humectancy is the staling of bread. How long
does a loaf of bread purchased at your
local bakery take to go stale? About two days. How long does a loaf of commercial
bread purchased at the supermarket take to go stale? About two to three weeks. This
works for the consumer because it retards spoilage and reduces waste. The food
industry and the supermarket associations are happy because it reduces depreciation,
thereby increasing profits. I checked my local supermarket: of the thirty-two
commercially available breads there, thirty-one were made with HFCS, added for both
browning and humectancy. And what were they lacking? Fiber.
Fast Food and Fiber
Currently, the median U.S. fiber consumption is 12 grams per day. This is on purpose.
The food industry removes fiber from food because fiber limits shelf life. Bread devoid
of fiber is going to last far longer in your pantry than if you buy it fresh at the farmers’
market. And the food industry capitalizes on this. Reduced depreciation means reduced
costs, which means increased sales. What’s the definition of
fast food
? It’s fiberless
food. Because you can’t freeze fiber and expect to maintain the same texture. Fiberless
food can be frozen, shipped globally, and cooked quickly. But getting rid of fiber has
obviated satiety, and exacerbated the negative impact of the carbohydrates, contributing
to hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.
When You Can’t Justify, Deflect
So there you are. Lots of reasons to add sugar and remove fiber. Good for the visual
presentation. Good for the palate. Good for the pocketbook. Good for the industry. But
bad for your health. Let’s take a generic cookie as an example: 30 percent flour, 30
percent fat, 30 percent sugar, and about 6 percent protein. This is the ultimate
concoction of fat and carbohydrate possible in one food item. And sweetness has more
salience (appeal) when you add fat. (Which would you rather eat: Pixie Stix or a
Cinnabon?) One cookie is a treat. But bet you can’t eat just one, because sugar is
addictive, and sugar plus fat is even more so. Our caloric overload, generated
specifically by added sugars, proves it.
The food industry says they do not understand what all the fuss is about. Sugar has
been around for millennia. Sugar is a source of energy. Sugar is a “natural” part of our
diet. True, but irrelevant in terms of our health. Here are some samples of the claims
the food industry or their ambassadors have used to persuade the public that the
addition of added sugar to food or drinks is as American as apple pie (with extra
HFCS).
Food Industry Argument #1: Fructose Doesn’t Raise Blood Glucose
The industry argues that fructose doesn’t raise blood glucose, and they’re right.
Fructose has a very low glycemic index (see
chapters 11
 and

), which is a measure
of a food’s generation of an insulin response and is used as a method for quantifying a
food’s potential for weight gain. But remember, there’s no fructose alone in nature. It is
always found with glucose (either as sucrose or HFCS), and the glucose contribution
generates quite a hefty insulin response.

 So when the glucose is metabolized, it drives
up insulin, while the fructose causes liver fat and liver insulin resistance.
Carbohydrates and fat together. A great way to get metabolic syndrome.
Food Industry Argument #2: Switch ’Em Up: Fructose for Glucose
The food industry would like to develop crystalline fructose (alone) as an FDA-
approved sweetener. They base this idea on several “controlled” studies that
demonstrate that when you substitute fructose for glucose (calorie for calorie) there is
no rise in HbA
1c
 (what doctors test the blood for in order to assess blood sugar control
in diabetic patients), a fact that suggests that fructose would be desirable for diabetics.

Perhaps one reason for this is that crystalline fructose is incompletely absorbed by the
small intestine, and thus its effects on glucose and HbA
1c
 may be minimal. However, if
your body doesn’t absorb the crystalline fructose, the GI symptoms caused by the
residual fructose wreak havoc on the intestine, generating pain, bloating, and diarrhea.

Remember how Olestra was going to revolutionize America? As a fat substitute, it
purported to add no fat, calories, or cholesterol to products. True, but it quickly lost its
market share due to side effects. As described by the health warning label, “This
product contains
Olestra. Olestra may cause abdominal cramping and loose stools.
Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and other nutrients.” The additive
quickly became synonymous with “anal leakage” and has since disappeared.
Crystalline fructose may follow the same path.
Furthermore, just because fructose doesn’t raise HbA
1c
 levels in the bloodstream of
diabetics, that doesn’t mean it’s not doing damage; Japanese researchers have shown
that fructose binds to proteins in people.

 It also doesn’t mean that fructose is not doing
damage to proteins
inside
 cells. Studies of animals receiving ad lib sucrose versus
starch show marked inflammation of liver cells leading to cirrhosis.

 Likewise, studies
of humans have demonstrated that sucrose consumption correlates with the degree of
liver inflammation.
The food industry points to controlled studies in which fructose is substituted for
glucose, with no increase in weight. (After all, if the calories eaten are the same, then
one would expect this.)

 They also like to quote a famous 1999 study showing that the
liver turns fructose to fat at a very low rate (less than 5 percent).

 If you believe this,
you should be able to drink as much soda as you want! Not so fast. It holds true only if
you’re thin, fasting (and therefore glycogen depleted), and given fructose alone (which
is poorly absorbed). Rather, if you’re obese, insulin-resistant, fed, and getting both
fructose and glucose together (a sizeable percentage of the population), then fructose
gets converted to fat at a much higher rate, approximating 25 percent. In other words,
the toxicity of fructose depends on the context. If you’re an elite athlete and glycogen-
depleted, you can eat or drink pretty much anything you want. But if you’re not, then our
current excessive sugar supply doesn’t work for you.
Food Industry Argument #3: The Food Label Is Right There!
The food industry argues that the information on sugar and fiber in our food is right
there on the Nutrition Facts label, in plain sight, for all to see. Based on that
information, people can make their own conscious decisions. Not quite. Under the
carbohydrate heading, the Nutrition Facts label lists “total sugars.” This signifies a
combination of all versions of monosaccharides, which include glucose, fructose, and
galactose (milk sugar); and
all disaccharides, which include maltose (glucose-glucose,
found in beer), lactose (glucose-galactose, found in dairy), and sucrose (glucose-
fructose, found everywhere!). For instance, one cup of low-fat milk has 12 grams of
sugar, which comes from lactose. The galactose is not a problem, as it is metabolized
to glucose and does not pose a significant health threat, unless you have the disease
galactosemia, in which case you’d have died of an overwhelming infection before you
were two months old.
Furthermore, the fructose that is found naturally in many foods is also not a
problem. This amount is usually small, and invariably there is some associated fiber,
which limits its negative effects. “All-natural” juice may not contain added sugar, but
because the fiber has ben removed from it (see
chapter 12
), it’s just a sugar-sweetened
beverage. Again, ounce for ounce, juice has more fructose and more calories than soft
drinks. What about canned fruit? The fruit itself is fine, but they can’t add water to the
can, because the sugar in the fruit would leach out. They instead add sugar syrup in high
concentration, to keep the fruit sweet and soft and to prevent spoilage. It’s the “added
sugar” that we need to know about, which is always either sucrose or HFCS, put in the
food specifically by the food industry for palatability and shelf life. Likewise, we need
to know how much fiber is included and how much has been removed.
But you’re not allowed to know this. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act
(NLEA) of 1990 allows for the declaration of “total sugars” as a whole.

 There is no
differentiation between them or provision for “added sugars.” The FDA stated that
there was no scientific evidence to argue that the body makes any distinction between
natural or added sugar. The inclusion of “added sugars” in the label underrepresents the
sugar content of foods high in endogenous or natural sugars. However, the fiber is the
mitigating factor, not the sugar. Lastly, the FDA believes there would be no way to
enforce such a rule and that the food industry would have no impetus to conform to it.
But the real reason we’re not allowed to know is pressure from food industry lobbyists.
Their argument to the FDA in 1989 was, “If we listed the added sugars on the label,
then all our competitors could duplicate our recipes. This is proprietary information,
and we won’t release it.” And the FDA bought that argument. Do you? You may not
believe the premise, but you buy the products.
You’ll also notice that there are Recommended Daily Values for every one of the
other nutrients on the food label. But there is no Recommended Daily Value or Dietary
Reference Intake (DRI) for sugar, either natural or added. I recently had the occasion to
sit on a panel with Sam Kass, Michelle Obama’s personal chef and her pointman to the
White House Childhood Obesity Task Force. I asked him straight out, “Why is there no
DRI for sugar?” His response might surprise you: “Why would you need a DRI for
something that is not a nutrient?” Wow! Sugar is not a nutrient? That might be news to
the USDA. I actually kind of agree with Mr. Kass. Sugar is certainly not an essential
nutrient, in the sense that there is not one single biochemical reaction that requires it.
Sugar is extraneous, and our bodies certainly don’t need it. As elaborated in
chapter 11
,
sugar is more toxin than it ever was a nutrient.
Food Industry Argument #4: It’s All About Supply and Demand
There are two philosophies of marketing, and the food industry has mastered both.
1.
We give the public what it wants
. The food industry is just responding to a need
by filling a “niche” in the American economy. This is how the industry would like to be
portrayed—as “reactive.” Portion sizes in this country are significantly larger than they
were twenty years ago. You buy a larger portion because you feel you’re getting a
better deal. You buy more, you eat more. Everybody wins. Well, not everybody. The
food industry wins by selling more, the middleman wins by levying the markup, the
government wins by levying the sales tax. You lose.
2.
If you build it, they will come.
 This is the real story: developing a market out of
nowhere—or being “proactive.” As I like to tell my children, “Advertising is necessary
only for products that we don’t want and don’t need.” The food industry (manufacturers,
retailers, and food service) is outranked only by the automobile industry in terms of
monetary expenditure for marketing. Like it or not, we are influenced in our choices by
what the media tell us to want. Especially our children. You may “know” that you
should eat more fruits and vegetables, but how many commercials do you
or your kids
watch that say so? Less than 5 percent of all food advertising dollars is spent by the
fruit, vegetable, and grain sectors. The government and USDA can’t compete with the
almost unlimited funds of the food industry. In 1997 the USDA spent $300 million to
promote healthy eating, in comparison to the $11 billion spent advertising junk food, of
which $4.2 billion was directed at children

 (see
chapter 20
).
Grease Their Palms to Grease the Wheels
That fast food and beverage companies sponsor teams, sporting events, charity walks,
and other physical activity–related venues to take the heat off the sugar they peddle is
as American as apple pie. It’s another thing entirely for them to finance the uniforms
and the scoreboards for schools around the country. In exchange for financial
compensation, schools sign exclusive marketing contracts with beverage companies to
permit on-campus advertising through product donations, scoreboards and signs,
clothing, and school supplies. The more beverages sold, the more money for the school
and more profits for the company. In a 2000 survey, 72 percent of California high
schools allowed advertising for fast food and beverages on campus, while only 13
percent prohibited it. And if you think it’s bad in the United States, try Latin America.
Consumption of soft drinks doubled in Mexico in seven years. Despite the fact that 75
percent of Mexican adults are currently overweight, Coca-Cola sponsors more physical
activity programs than all other companies put together.

If You Can’t Beat ’Em, Join ’Em
Despite the rhetoric, the food industry knows it has a problem. Enter the new market of
“functional foods.” As Pepsico chairwoman Indra Nooyi so eloquently stated in
The
New Yorker
 (May 16, 2011), “It’s not a question of selling less. It’s a question of
selling the right stuff.” In response to the obesity pandemic, Pepsi now has three lines:
“Fun for you” (e.g., chips
and soda), “Better for you” (e.g., juice and beef jerky), and
“Good for you” (e.g., whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, nuts).
Americans know that they’re gaining weight and that they should be eating healthier.
So the food industry helps us assuage our guilt with processed products labeled
“natural” and “whole wheat,” or containing “extra nutrients.” You buy them, probably
paying extra, and feel better about eating them. None of these taglines has any
meaningful definition, and there is little to no regulation about when they can be used.
We are currently in “throwback” mode: many soft drink manufacturers, such as Pepsi,
are substituting sucrose for HFCS based on the myth that sucrose is more “natural” and
therefore better for you. Sobe Drinks, with 100 percent of your daily vitamin C
requirements, are essentially flavored sugar water. Just because you don’t feel any guilt
doesn’t mean your body won’t feel the effects. Promise—if all the HFCS-containing
candy bars in the world somehow mysteriously were replaced by their sucrose-
containing equivalents, they would still be junk food, and your body wouldn’t know the
difference—although they might cost more and you might balk at the increased price.
Investors are watching Pepsi carefully. As it promotes its “Good for You” line, it
has reduced the marketing of its “Fun for You” line, to the tune of $349 million. In the
process, Pepsi-Cola has fallen to third place in soft drink sales, behind Coke and Diet
Coke. It remains to be seen if what is essentially a “junk food company” can recreate
itself. If not, don’t expect any risk taking from the others.
Who’s in Charge?
If there’s any lesson to be gleaned from this book, it’s that food is health. But while you
are ostensibly in charge of your health, you are clearly not in charge of your food. In
fact, those who are in charge of your food are doing their level best to make a buck off
you. Food companies in the year 2010 generated nearly $1 trillion in sales. And if your
health goes down the tubes, that’s your problem. But it’s not just
your
 problem. It’s
everyone’s problem. The cigarette industry was chastised for an irrational business
model: poisoning your best customers is not considered a growth strategy.
But if you
can hook more people on the front end, you can guarantee your supply of users, so you
can afford to lose a few. The food industry has a leg up on this model: corner the food
market, and people will have no place else to go. Is it any wonder that the food
industry, in the midst of two negative trends—the economic downturn and the obesity
pandemic—is making money hand over fist?
# Part V
The Personal Solution
Chapter 17
A
Altering Your Food Environment
John was born at normal weight, but with a voracious appetite, and
became massively obese by age one. By fifteen, he was up to 340
pounds. His parents sent him to the Academy of the Sierras (“fat
school”) for a year, where his food was restricted and his weight
dropped by 100 pounds. Within three months of returning home, he
gained 140 pounds. He then came to see me. Genetic testing showed that
he had two mutations in the gene coding for a protein that mediates the
satiety signal in the hypothalamus. In other words, his hunger, appetite,
and obesity were due to a genetic defect. Nonetheless, when his
environment was controlled, even he could lose weight.
s this clinical vignette shows us, controlling behavior doesn’t work, because
behavior is really just the output of our biochemistry. Controlling behavior is
unsustainable. If your brain can’t receive the leptin signal (see
chapters 4
–

), it thinks
it’s being starved and it initiates behaviors to regain the weight. But even John, a
patient with a genetic defect, can lose weight when his environment is controlled and
his access to food is regulated (although there are rare exceptions, as with the brain
tumor children). The problem is how to control our environment adequately, when there
is such free access to high-sugar, low-fiber food, to help us with our weight. Parents
can do so—they must make their homes safe for their children (see
chapter 18
). Our
culture needs to adopt the precept that making a home
safe for a toddler includes both
child safety locks and a wholesome food environment. But once a child enters puberty
—a state of insulin resistance, independence, allowance, and peer pressure—the game
is over. That’s why virtually all anti-obesity interventions work better in younger
children.
Our environment is toxic (see
chapters 10
–

) because it is insulinogenic and, in
turn, obesogenic.

 For the vast majority of obese people, in order to reverse the
process, the goal is to
get the insulin down
. That starts with what you eat, and it means
altering your point of contact—your relationship with your supermarket, grocery store,
and restaurants.
“Trash Talk” on the Dietary Playground
The public is preoccupied and yet completely flummoxed by the low-fat-versus-low-
carb diet controversy. They couldn’t be further apart both on the evolutionary scene and
in the supermarket, where the meat and produce aisles are located on opposite sides of
the store. The proponents of each of these diets aggressively dispute the others. Today,
there are more authors in this arena than any other aspect of health. Scientists “trash-
talk” their opponents, as if bringing the other side down will elevate one’s cause.
Medical societies have taken sides. Their venom has created a noxious atmosphere.
The fallout from this “food fight” has confused the issue and given the entire discipline
of nutrition a bad name.
The “Dish” on Diets
Most people will put themselves “on a diet” in an attempt to lose weight, ostensibly by
controlling their food environment. But what does this mean? Why do these diets work
for some but not for others? What’s the most rational diet for you? Do any of them
perform as advertised? There are more fad diets than there are cold remedies.
Furthermore, when a diet doesn’t work, the assumption is that you weren’t compliant
with it. But compliance is a measure of change in behavior. Sustainable behavior
change means changing the environment.
To pry behavior and environment apart, first let’s start with the basic precepts of
what makes a good diet. As an example, let’s examine a “failed” diet and determine
why it failed.
The Low-Fat Diet—a Dismal Failure
As discussed in
chapter 10
, the low-fat diet is what got us into this mess. It started out
as a prescription to prevent heart disease, not obesity. The link between dietary fat and
heart disease is based on findings regarding a genetic disease called familial
hypercholesterolemia (FH), which affects 1 percent of the population.

 In the 1980s the
low-fat diet became the diet recommended by every health organization in America
(AHA, both ADAs [American Diabetes
and
 Dietetic associations], the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, and so on) to control obesity as well as prevent heart
disease. Their mantra was eating less fat would reduce the total number of calories and
contribute to weight loss because
a calorie is a calorie.
 Except it’s not.
So what happened to the other 99 percent of the population? Does the low-fat diet
work for them? As the Occupy Wall Street movement says, the other 99 percent got
screwed. Not only does it not work in the way it is routinely employed, but it is likely
detrimental for three different reasons. First, a low-fat diet tastes like cardboard; the
flavor is in the fat. So you up the carbs to compensate, increasing your insulin, and your
weight (see
chapter 9
). Second, as discussed in
chapter 10
, there are two LDLs. Large
buoyant (type A) LDL, which accounts for about 80 percent of the circulating LDL, is
increased by saturated fat. But large buoyant LDL has a neutral impact and by itself
poses little risk for heart disease. Conversely, small dense (type B) LDL, which
accounts for the other 20 percent, is driven by dietary carbohydrates.

 It is type B that
contributes to heart disease.

 Third, if dietary fats were merely sources of energy, then
we wouldn’t have a class of essential fatty acids that we literally cannot live without.
We need to eat certain dietary fats for our nervous system and immune systems, cell
membranes, and to make certain hormones. So you have a choice: you can eat good fats
in your diet or you can make bad ones in your liver. Wouldn’t you rather opt for the
good ones?
The reason the low-fat diet is a dismal failure is explained by the science in
chapters 10
–

. It’s not the fat, it’s not the carbohydrate—it’s the fat
and
 the
carbohydrate together that cause metabolic problems. Sugar provides just that, and the
low-fat diet is rife with it. The lack of fiber in the processed low-fat diet means that the
rate of flux of both fat and carbohydrates to the liver is heightened, putting your poor
liver under even more stress. The epitome of failure.
As you will see, all successful diets share three precepts: low sugar, high fiber
(which means high micronutrients), and fat and carbohydrate consumed together in the
presence of an offsetting amount of fiber. Anything after that is window dressing.
The Atkins Diet—Depends on How It’s Done
The adherents to the low-carb diet are numerous because, for the most part, it does
work for weight loss and improved metabolic health.

 The most famous of the low-carb
options is the Atkins diet, which says, “Bring on the bratwurst, banish the bun.” Indeed,
the Atkins diet is one, albeit somewhat radical, method for treating the co-morbidities
of metabolic syndrome. The question is, does the Atkins diet work because it is low-
carb, or because it is low-sugar? We still don’t know.
Four issues complicate the use of the Atkins diet as a full-time regime. First, a fat is
not a fat (see
chapter 10
). The quality of the fat counts, and scarfing down bad ones can
also be detrimental. Second, the Atkins diet says you should eat your vegetables,
especially the green ones, but casual Atkins dabblers don’t—that’s why they
like
 the
diet. But the vegetables confer both fiber and micronutrients (see
chapter 12
). One
animal model suggests that despite weight loss, the Atkins diet can increase other risk
factors for atherosclerosis.

 Furthermore, the diet can result in inadequacies in the
micronutrients thiamine, folic acid, vitamin C, iron, and magnesium, all of which could
have been supplied with the fiber.

 The Atkins diet cuts out milk because lactose is a
carbohydrate—there goes the vitamin D for your bone health. And the higher protein
forces urinary calcium loss, putting your bones at greater risk. Third, many people
gauge the success of the Atkins diet by their degree of weight loss. However, that’s
because most of the
early weight loss is due to loss of liver and muscle glycogen,
which is surrounded by water molecules. But this is a double-edged sword, because
even a minor transgression will form new glycogen, bringing water with it. Fourth,
adherence to the Atkins diet is very uneven.

 And good luck trying to keep a kid on the
Atkins diet during the school year. The question is, do you really need to be this
extreme? Isn’t there a better way?
The Vegetarian/Vegan Diet—Depends on How It’s Done
What about the opposite? As you saw from the case of Sujatha in
chapter 12
’s clinical
vignette, eating vegan or vegetarian is no protection against obesity or metabolic
syndrome. Processed foods devoid of animal products can be just as bad for you as
those containing them. Because any diet can be processed, with the removal of fiber
and the addition of fat, carbohydrates, and sugar, just as easily as the Western diet. So
it’s all in the execution. If you eat a vegetarian or vegan diet the way our gatherer
ancestors did—eating the food as it comes out of the ground—you’re good to go,
although you might need to supplement the diet with calcium and vitamin D. But if you
eat the “processed” vegetarian diet out of the middle shelves of the supermarket, with
fat and sugar additives for palatability and the removal of fiber for shelf life,

 then you
and Sujatha’s mother can wallow in your incredulity together.
The Traditional Japanese Diet
The
traditional
 Japanese diet is polished white rice (lots of carbohydrate), a little fish,
some fermented soybeans, and lots of vegetables. And it works in preventing both
obesity and chronic metabolic disease. (I should mention that the
modern
 Japanese diet,
replete with HFCS, is just as bad as the U.S. diet. Japanese are getting metabolic
syndrome in record numbers and are doing bariatric surgery at Tokyo Children’s
Hospital.) Even though it is high in carbs, the traditional Japanese diet works for four
reasons: First, there is virtually no sugar to promote insulin resistance. Second, the
insulin rise caused by the glucose in the rice is partially attenuated by the fiber in their
vegetables. Third, the fish is high in omega-3s. Four, it’s high in
micronutrients and
antioxidants. A winning combination. Using fiber as the antidote to carbohydrate (see
chapter 12
) is the salvation of many a successful diet.
The Mediterranean Diet
Pioppi, a small town in Italy, is the home of the Mediterranean diet. In Ancel Keys’
Seven Countries study (Italy was one the countries), this diet was associated with
lower death rates from heart disease. The diet was popularized in America due to its
population’s low incidence of disease and long lifespan. Unfortunately, Pioppi and
many surrounding areas that originally consumed a peasant fare can no longer afford to
do so. Processed food is more readily available and cheaper. These areas, once
renowned for their health, have soaring rates of obesity in part due to a current lack of
whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables from their diets. These items are just too
expensive, and they don’t taste as good.
Here’s what’s in the
real
 Mediterranean diet: high olive oil consumption
(monounsaturated fat); legumes (beans, lentils, peas); fruits, vegetables, and unrefined
grains (fiber); dairy products (saturated fat); eggs (high-quality protein); fish (omega-
3s); and wine in moderation (resveratrol, flavonoids, and likely other factors).

Americans misunderstand the Mediterranean diet, because they think it is all about
pasta, which is Italian but
not
 Mediterranean. Because what the Italians used to eat in
Italy is not what the Italians ate in the United States. The pasta and pizza movement
actually started in the United States within the poor Italian immigrant population, based
on the cost of carbohydrates versus meat. That diet then migrated over to Italy. And
now the Italians have our problem.
The Ornish Diet
This diet, popularized by Dean Ornish at the University of California, San Francisco in
his 1993 book,
Eat More, Weigh Less
, is the one diet that has been proven not only to
promote weight loss but to
reverse heart disease
 and improve cellular health,
hypothetically increasing your lifespan.

 The Ornish diet espouses that participants
should not get more than 10 percent
of their calories from fat. (A low-fat diet provides
about 30 percent of calories as fat.)
Here’s what’s allowed on the Ornish diet: beans and legumes, fruits, whole grains,
and vegetables (in other words, all fiber all the time). Ornish allows nonfat dairy
products in moderation. And here are the no-nos: meat of all kinds, poultry, oils and
oil-containing products (e.g., salad dressings), nuts and seeds, sugar, and alcohol. In
other words, the no-fun diet. Ornish decries anything with a saturated fat or an omega-6,
which is highly defensible. But he is conflicted on the consumption of fish. While he
acknowledges that fish is rich in omega-3s, which can reduce sudden cardiac death by
50–80 percent, he’d rather take fish oil capsules. He argues that eating salmon,
mackerel, halibut, and other deepwater fishes provides a lot of extra fat and
cholesterol, along with mercury and other toxic waste products that have found their
way into the ocean. Ornish also has a love-hate relationship with olive oil, which
provides oleic acid, a stimulator of an important liver health pathway. But he chides
that olive oil is 14 percent saturated fat and 100 percent total fat. So, the more olive oil
consumed, the higher your cholesterol goes.
As far as I am concerned, that’s throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The low-
fat diet, promoted by the government and doctors in the 1980s and 1990s, failed
because it didn’t tell you what else to eat and what to restrict. As Ornish clearly shows,
fat by itself is not the culprit; it’s what you substitute for it that causes the problem. But
the biggest problem is that when adherents are left to the whim of the grocery store, the
Ornish diet gradually morphs into the general low-fat diet, with all its problems.

The Paleolithic Diet—an Evolutionary Compromise
The Paleolithic diet, which is low-carb and high-fat, includes foods that were available
to our ancestors prior to agriculture: meat, fish, nuts, natural fruits, and vegetables. It
excludes milk, grains, and processed foods of any sort. This diet has been popularized
by scientists, including Loren Cordain and S. Boyd Eaton.

 Staffan Lindeberg studied
the inhabitants of Kitava, an island just off Papua New Guinea, who still live naturally
on this diet today.

 They do not suffer from heart disease, diabetes, obesity,
hypertension, or stroke. My UCSF colleague Dr. Lynda Frassetto has shown that even
ten days of a Paleolithic diet can improve blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, glucose
tolerance, and lipid profiles whether or not you lose weight.

 One issue with the
Paleolithic diet is the lack of vitamin D and calcium (not an issue for our Paleolithic
ancestors, who spent all their time outdoors), which could potentially be made up with
supplements. Others knock its reliance on animal meat as a protein source, but the
quality of the fats is still much better than with the Western diet. This diet also excludes
all grains, including those with fiber, which may not be necessary to limit. But perhaps
the biggest problem is its expense. To do this diet right costs way more than a trip to
Whole Foods, which means that the poor aren’t invited to the Caveman Party.
The Low–Glycemic Index Diet—Theory versus Practice
Another alternative for reducing insulin that has procured press and adherents is called
the low–glycemic index (GI) diet. “Glycemic index” refers to a theory of eating with
the purpose of keeping down blood sugar (and therefore insulin), but it is not the
panacea that the zealots hype. GI is a simple concept: how high does your serum
glucose rise in response to 50 grams of carbohydrate in any given food, as compared
with the glucose response in 50 grams of straight starch (white bread). However, as we
saw in
chapter 8
, it’s not the glucose response that matters; it’s the insulin response that
follows. The yo-yo glucose-insulin effect of a high-GI diet is thought to drive excess
energy intake and promote obesity.

As useful a concept as GI is, the concept of glycemic load (GL) is even more
relevant; it takes into account the beneficial effect of fiber.

 The GL of a food is
calculated as its GI x the amount of that food containing 50 grams of carbohydrate.
More fiber means a larger portion, because there’s less digestible carbohydrate. You
can turn a high-GI food into a low-GL food by eating it with the original fiber. A good
example is carrots, which are high-GI (lots of carbohydrates) but low-GL (even more
fiber).
There are two problems with GI and GL. The low-GI diet is most effective in
patients who have obesity due to excessive insulin release by the pancreas.

That
makes sense based on how the low-GI diet prevents the blood glucose from rising in
response to a meal. The second problem with the concepts of GI and GL is fructose
itself. Fructose isn’t glucose; when eaten, it doesn’t raise the glucose and it doesn’t
raise the insulin directly. Indeed, fructose was originally touted as an excellent sugar
alternative for patients with diabetes, precisely because it has a low GI of 20. But
fructose is the most egregious cause of liver insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome,
because of its unique liver metabolism (see
chapter 11
). This hasn’t stopped the food
industry from trying to capitalize on the low-GI craze by adding fructose to foods. The
low-GL diet takes into account insulin suppression and fiber. Add to that a low-
fructose diet, and you have the main tenets of the South Beach diet. Keeping insulin
low, eating lots of fiber, and avoiding added sugar. Now you’ve got something.
Tweaking Your Diet Based on Genetics or Biochemistry
Should our genetics determine our diet? Some diets may work better in one person or
another based on genetics. Certainly, for the 1 percent with familial
hypercholesterolemia (see
chapter 10
), it’s either the low-fat diet (with statins) or
Heart Attack City. Latinos are famous for developing diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease, due to a gene alteration expressed in the liver. If you’re one of the 19
percent of Latinos with this gene defect, then any fructose you consume goes straight to
liver fat—do not pass Go, do not collect $200. And in one study, the success of
different diets was dependent on three separate genes that control fat metabolism.

By far and away, your insulin profile is the most important factor in determining
what diet approach will work best for you. Here are four different studies that argue for
knowing your insulin:
1.   The low-GI diet worked best in those subjects whose pancreases released the
most insulin.

2.   The low-carb diet worked best in the subjects with the most insulin
resistance.

3.   Yet, if the insulin resistance is caused by a genetic variation, then
going low-
carb can’t fix the problem, in which case a high-carb, low-fat diet is more
effective in improving weight loss.

4.   And of course, our octreotide studies (see
chapter 4
) argue that insulin
suppression is an effective method to promote weight loss.
Commonsense Dieting Means
No
 Dieting
Let’s look at all these diets. Some rely on fat for energy, others rely on carbohydrates
for energy, and some use both. Yet they all work to control weight and improve
metabolic health, and have been shown to reduce heart disease. What do they all share?
Two things. They are all low in sugar, and they are all high in fiber (and therefore high
in micronutrients). We’ve arrived. That’s the point—that’s what matters. You now hold
the keys to the kingdom. Naturally occurring fructose comes from sugarcane, fruits,
some vegetables, and honey. The first three have way more fiber than fructose, and the
last is protected by bees. Nature made sugar hard to get. Man made it easy to get. And
that’s the nugget of truth that the food industry and the U.S. government won’t admit;
because if they did, they’d have to scale back, and they either can’t or don’t want to
(see
chapter 21
). That’s why the rates of obesity and chronic metabolic disease have
skyrocketed wherever the industrial global diet has been introduced.
The number of people who can stick to any diet is exceedingly small.
Recidivism
 is
the watchword of dieting. First there’s temptation. Then there’s convenience. Then
there’s lack of access. Then there’s boredom. And the “cherry on the frappe” is the
negative-weight plateau for most dieters, which weakens your willpower even further.
Diet Sweeteners: Panacea or Propaganda?
This is one of the thorniest issues in nutrition today. On this subject, I am agnostic—
because the data on which to make a recommendation on which diet sweetener is best,
or on whether diet sweeteners are a smart alternative at all, remain elusive.
Diet sweeteners, on the surface, would make perfect sense as an alternative to
either sucrose or HFCS. They substitute sweetness for calories and remove the
offending fructose. The United States has been slowly but surely turning to diet drinks
because of the obesity epidemic; as of 2010, 42 percent of Coca-Cola sales in the
United States were of the diet variety. Not so fast. If 33 percent of all sugar
consumption is in drinks, and 42 percent of drinks are now diet, someone should be
losing weight. Yet there is not one study that shows that substituting diet drinks for
sugared ones actually causes weight loss in obese subjects. There are several studies,
promoted by the sugar industry, that demonstrate that consumption of diet drinks
correlates with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.

 But remember, correlation is
not causation. Do diet sweeteners cause metabolic syndrome, or do people with
metabolic syndrome consume more diet drinks to assuage their guilt from eating
Twinkies? So why don’t we know if the substitution of diet sweeteners for sugar
actually reduces caloric intake, body fat, and metabolic disease?

 There are five
specific issues that underlie our ignorance.

1.   There is a difference between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In
short, pharmacokinetics is what your body does to a drug; pharmacodynamics is what a
drug does to your body. They are not the same—far from it. We have all the information
on pharmacokinetics for all the diet sweeteners to determine safety, because the FDA
demands it before any sweetener is approved for the U.S. market. But we have none of
the pharmacodynamics. We don’t know what any of these diet sweeteners do to your
long-term food intake, weight, body fat, or metabolic status. And the reason we don’t
have the pharmacodynamics is that the FDA doesn’t demand such studies. They
examine only two criteria for a drug (or sweetener) to be approved: safety and efficacy.
So the food industry doesn’t do the studies because such studies are expensive and may
have detrimental effects on sales. And the NIH won’t do them, saying it’s the food
industry’s job. So the studies don’t get done. What about the nonabsorbed sweeteners?
Sugar alcohols such as xylitol and sorbitol aren’t absorbed across the intestine, so
they’re safe, right? Yes, except that in high amounts they cause significant
gastrointestinal distress, bloating, and diarrhea.
2.   Here’s a hypothetical concern. You drink a soda. The tongue tastes either sugar
or diet sweetener—it doesn’t know which—and sends the “sweet” signal to the
hypothalamus, which says, “Hey, a sugar load is coming, get ready to metabolize it.”
The hypothalamus then sends a signal along the vagus nerve to the pancreas, saying, “A
sugar load is coming, get ready to release extra insulin.” If the “sweet” signal is from a
diet sweetener, the sugar never comes. What happens next? Does the hypothalamus say,
“Oh, well…I’ll just chill until the next meal,” or does it say, “WTF? I’m all primed for
the extra sugar. I’ll go find some.” We don’t know if the brain compensates for the lack
of sugar.
3.   The possibility exists that diet sweeteners might change the composition of
intestinal bacteria. This may generate inflammation (see
chapter 12
), and increase
deposition of visceral fat.
4.   We don’t know the role that diet sweeteners may play in sugar addiction (see
chapter 5
). Down-regulation of dopamine receptors by sucrose means you have to
supply more sugar next time to get the same effect, creating a positive feedback system
and driving further intake. The same has been seen with diet sweeteners. So,
conceivably, diet sweeteners foment the same biochemical dependence, which drives
further sugar-seeking behavior. So even if you don’t get sugar at this meal, you’ll make
sure you get it at the next one.
5.   The issue of diet sweetener safety is extremely complex. The FDA party line
says, if it’s approved, it’s safe. But is it? Concerns continue to abound about aspartame,
despite its availability on the market for the past thirty years. Then there’s the other
side. The sugar industry has loads of reasons for blurring the landscape. Any diet
sweetener that threatens their dominance generates a no-holds-barred takedown.
They’ve attacked every diet sweetener that has appeared on the market since
saccharine.
How to Navigate a Food Label
Controlling your personal food environment is all about the point of decision. How do
you navigate your supermarket? It’s a minefield.
First Rule
If you go to the market hungry, all is lost.
Second Rule
Shop on the periphery of the supermarket. If you go into the shelves, you’ve gone off the
ranch.
Third Rule
Real food doesn’t have or need a Nutrition Facts label. The more labels you read, the
more garbage you’re buying.
Fourth Rule
Real food spoils—which is a good thing. If bacteria can digest it, that means you can,
too (since your mitochondria are just repurposed bacteria). There are three major
downsides to eating real food. The first is that it takes time to cook. But by eating real
food, you automatically increase your levels of fiber and micronutrients and reduce
your fructose and trans fats. The second is that it spoils, so you can’t keep it in your
pantry indefinitely. The third is that real food is more expensive. That’s the biggest
problem.
Fifth Rule
Find the hidden sugar. And they hide it well. The Nutrition Facts label requires the
listing of ingredients by mass. By using different forms of sugar in any given product,
the food industry can add many different sugars to one product. The grams don’t change,
but the order on the label does. The
food industry has at least forty other names for
sugar, in an effort to hide it on the label, but a discerning eye can always spot them
(
table 17.1
). Caveat emptor (buyer beware)!
Table 17.1. Various Names for Sugar Added to Processed Foods
Plus, the food industry is introducing sugar to infants at an ever-earlier age. Abbott
Labs makes Isomil, a lactose-free baby formula; the lactose is substituted with 10.3
percent sucrose. (A Coke is 10.5 percent sucrose.) Mead Johnson discontinued
production of their chocolate-flavored “toddler formula” Enfagrow in 2010 because of
the backlash from consumers regarding the amount of sugar required to balance the
chocolate (which is inherently bitter); however, the vanilla version is still on the
market. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Gerber and Heinz
add sugars and/or starchy fillers to more than half of their second-
and third-stage fruits
and several second-stage vegetables. Is it any wonder we have an epidemic of obese
six-month olds?
So how to curb your sugar consumption? Start with eliminating all sugared
beverages. We were designed to
eat
 our calories, not drink them. Just think of a soda as
a “fructose delivery vehicle,” similar to cigarettes. And juice is worse than soda. Juice
has 5.8 teaspoons of sugar per cup; soda has 5.4. Eat your fruit, don’t drink it. Second,
take all your recipes and wherever sugar is called for, reduce the amount by one third. I
promise, your home-baked goods will be better tasting and better for you. You can
actually taste the chocolate, the oatmeal, the nuts. Lastly, make dessert special. When I
grew up, dessert was once a week. Now it’s once a meal and also at snack time. My
children know that a weekday dessert means a piece of fruit, and weekends are
reserved for something more elaborate. I guarantee you, they won’t feel deprived.
If a food has a Nutrition Facts label, by definition it’s processed. Everyone
immediately focuses on the total calories and grams of saturated fat. These are the least
important properties of any food. Here’s the real scoop on what to look for on a
Nutrition Facts label: If it’s a liquid, it should have 5 calories or less. (Unflavored milk
is the only exception. Remember, milk sugar is lactose, which turns into glucose in the
liver—no fructose here.) If it’s a solid, it should have 3 grams of fiber or more (See
chapter 12
). If the words
partially hydrogenated
 (aka trans fat) appear anywhere, it’s
been designed not to go rancid. So it may very well outlast you. If any form of sugar is
one of the first three ingredients, it’s a dessert. Here are two examples of how to use
these simple rules at the point of contact.
1.   Yogurt. A 20-ounce Coca-Cola has 27 grams of “total sugars.” A standard 6-
ounce Yoplait yogurt also has 27 grams of “total sugars.” But yogurt’s healthy,
right? How much of those 27 grams is milk sugar (lactose, not harmful) and how
much is added sugar (sucrose)? A Greek yogurt with no added sweeteners is 64
grams of total sugar per 24 ounces, or 16 grams per 6 ounces. That means that
an individual Yoplait has 11 grams of added sugar. So when you consume a
Yoplait, you’re getting a yogurt plus 8 ounces of Coca-Cola.
2.   Chocolate milk. Milk has calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D, all necessary for
growing children, and for adults to prevent osteoporosis. An 8-ounce carton of
1 percent milk has 130 calories and 15 grams of “total sugars” (lactose).
However, an 8-ounce carton of 1 percent chocolate milk has 190 calories and
29 grams of “total sugars,” including 14 grams of added sugar (HFCS). So
chocolate milk is milk plus 10 ounces of Coca-Cola.
Yogurt and chocolate milk are perfect examples of how the food industry hides the
sugar. The Nutrition Facts label lists “total sugars.” If these are from lactose (milk
sugar) or from the sugar within the original fruit or vegetable prior to packaging, they
are not of concern. The only sugar that you need be concerned about is the “added
sugar,” that which is specifically added by the food industry for all the reasons just
stated. The industry does not have to report this number on the label, for “proprietary
concerns” (see
chapter 16
). But by checking the ingredient list and looking for the forty
names for added sugar, you can outsmart them.
Then we have the problem of juice. There’s no added sugar, but there is subtracted
fiber, which makes the sugar in juice equivalent to sugar having been “added.” This is
one reason why the USDA Nutrition Facts food label needs a complete overhaul (see
chapter 21
).
The goal of the supermarket exercise is to shift your food buying from a high-
fructose, high-trans-fat, low-fiber (i.e., processed) grocery basket to a low-fructose,
zero-trans-fat, high-fiber (natural) basket. The only rational way is to buy real food in
the first place. The meat, the dairy, the produce. One of Michael Pollan’s rules from his
book
Food Rules
 is “If your grandmother wouldn’t recognize it as food, it isn’t.” Of
course, your grandmother might not recognize tempeh or tofu, miso or edamame—but
someone’s grandmother would. I would also add that if the food has a company logo
you’ve heard of, it’s processed. If you eat real food, your weight will take care of
itself, just as it did for the fifty thousand years since irrigation and the taming of fire.
We have no choice but to try to recreate the kind of food supply our grandparents had,
before the food processors tainted it. In the UCSF WATCH Clinic, we provide the
parents of our obese patients with a
shopping list where the foods are sorted by what
they do to your insulin (
table 17.2
).
Table 17.2: A “Real” versus “Processed” Food Shopping List
The goal of obesity management is to keep your insulin down. This is a sample shopping list, based on four principles,
to accomplish this goal:
1. Low sugar
2. High fiber
3. Low omega-6 fats
4. Low trans fats
Similar to the Traffic Light Diet, items listed as “green” can be eaten ad lib, those listed as “yellow” suggest mild
caution (about three to five times per week), and those in “red” should be reserved for special occasions (about 1 to 2
times per week).

As real food costs more than processed food, many will view these
recommendations as paternalistic and pejorative against the poor. However, only 19
percent of all money spent on food in the United States is for the food itself. The other
81 percent is for packaging and marketing. This is one hell of an upcharge, especially
on the poor. If and when all America gets tired of paying it, maybe the food industry
will rethink its strategies. (Occupy Nabisco, anyone?) In the meantime, they’re going to
ride this gravy train.
How to Eat Without Cooking
Not everyone can, has time to, wants to, or knows how to cook. While these people are
at a minor disadvantage in eating real food, it’s not impossible. The first rule is, stay
out of fast food restaurants at all costs. No good can come of them. Beware packaged
products, even those claiming to be organic. Many of them contain the same amount of
sugar as their commercial counterparts. If you’re buying a dish at a coffee shop or
diner, make sure it has something green in it. Second, don’t buy anything you can eat
while standing up, because then you’re not thinking about your food, and you’re likely
using your hands (which means more processed carbohydrates), not utensils. Sit down,
enjoy it, make it a meal. Third, make sure it has some sort of protein—anything from
sliced turkey to natural peanut butter is okay, just don’t go for a baked good, which is
just fat, carbohydrates, and sugar. Lastly, no smoothies or Frappuccinos!
How to Survive a Restaurant
This chapter is about controlling your food environment. Restaurants are the ultimate
loss of control. You have no control over what goes into the food, portion sizes, how
quickly the food arrives, or whether there are bread or tortilla chips placed on the table
before the meal. Plus, you must solve the immediate intellectual/emotional dilemma of
volume versus taste versus price. No wonder buffets are so popular. So, does this mean
you can never go to a restaurant again?
Portion sizes served at fast food restaurants have increased significantly since the
1970s. Sodas have increased by 49 calories, French fries by 68 calories, and
hamburgers by 97 calories. Frequent fast food eaters consume more calories per day on
average than non- or infrequent fast food eaters. Pricing and packaging encourage larger
portions. In an experimental restaurant setting, customers who were served a larger
portion ate 43 percent more. Children who eat at fast food restaurants twice a week
increase their obesity risk by 60 percent, and those who frequent one three times a
week, 300 percent.

 There is a wide discrepancy between the number of calories
customers expect to find in a fast food meal and the number they actually consume.

 In
addition, customers overestimate the healthfulness of fast food items that carry health
claims. While salads and apple dippers are on the McDonald’s top-ten list along with
the Big Mac and French fries, most customers are not able to accurately assess the true
caloric value of these so-called “healthy” options. Lastly, even when they rate a serving
as too large, people will finish a larger portion merely because they’ve already paid
for it.

 Even having eaten more than they wanted, customers still see these “extra-
value” meals as a good deal.
The rules for dealing with restaurants are very simple.
1.   If the food comes in a wrapper, the wrapper has more health benefits than the
food. Fast food restaurants are the antithesis of real food.
2.   Whatever you do, don’t order soda.
3.   Ask the server not to put bread and chips on the table.
4.   If you’ve already had dessert this week, don’t make this your second.
So What’s the Answer?
Do we need to avoid restaurants and supermarkets like the plague? Do we need to eat
what our ancestors did or eschew all carbs? I would propose that all we need to do is
eat “safe carbs.” That means low sugar to prevent insulin resistance, and high fiber to
reduce flux to the liver and prevent insulin hypersecretion. And while we’re at it, eat
“safe fat,” that is, real fat rather than synthetic fat (such as trans fats, which can’t be
metabolized). Michael Pollan, in his
New York Times
 article “Unhappy Meals,” exhorts
us to “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” That’s seven words; I’ll reduce it to
three:
eat real food
. The “not too much” will take care of itself. And the “mostly
plants” isn’t a worry if you eat the plants as they came out of the ground, or the animals
who ate the food that came out of the ground—because they ate plants. The point
missing in the various diet plans just explained is that all real food is inherently good.
It’s what we
do
 to the food that is bad. Keep the food intact—you can steam, boil, or
grill it. Food processing is the Mr. Hyde of this obesity pandemic. And the way to
reverse it is to do the opposite.
Of course, this means major changes in the ways that both we and the food industry
do business. But remember the early 1980s. The food industry had to overhaul its entire
operation to adhere to the low-fat guidelines. It can do it again. One food industry
executive told me, “We can change, with two provisos. We won’t go it alone”—
meaning the rest of the industry will need to follow suit—“and we can’t lose money.”
Well, today, both of those are nonstarters. No doubt such changes would affect food
prices. But it doesn’t mean that everyone will have to pay more at the store. It all
depends on how the U.S. government chooses to respond (see
chapters 21
 and

). The
battle against obesity must be waged on two fronts: at the individual level and at the
public health level. Until the food industry, the grocery industry, and the restaurant
industry realize that it is not in their best interest to provide our
current processed food
choices, don’t expect our global food environment to improve anytime soon. Educating
yourself as to what’s in your food and what it does to you is half the battle to control
your and your children’s personal food environment. Educating government to improve
everyone’s food environment will be covered in detail in

Chapter 18

Altering Your Hormonal Environment
DeShawn is an eight-year-old African American boy who comes to
clinic weighing 110 pounds and has a BMI of 35. He was referred due
to an orthopedic condition in which both hips slipped out of their joints,
limiting his motion and his ability to exercise. DeShawn is obstinate,
confrontational, and doing poorly in school. His mother, while friendly
and seemingly compliant, is also obese and very defensive. She tells us
at each visit that she is doing exactly what we advise, ridding the house
of sugared beverages, eating real food, and waiting twenty minutes for
second portions. But at each clinic visit, DeShawn continues to show a
gain in weight. Within three years, his weight is up to 255 pounds, and
he has a BMI of 50. He develops obstructive sleep apnea, a potentially
fatal illness, necessitating a call to Child Protective Services in an
attempt to save his life. It is the thought of losing her son that forces the
mother to face up to her own sugar addiction. She rids the house of the
sodas that populated it, and she and DeShawn both get psychiatric
therapy. Within a year, each has lost 60 pounds, and DeShawn is
conversant, pleasant, confident, and doing much better in school.
o doubt some of you will read this chapter and say, “What planet is this dude from?
He talks about altering the ‘hormonal environment,’ but what he’s really talking
about is altering behavior. I could have gotten this out of any other self-help book.” Au
contraire, mon frère. We,
both individually and as a society, need to do something
differently to fix this pandemic. Clearly something needs to change. But change
behavior? If you try to modify behavior you’re doomed to failure, as evidenced by the
sixty million diet recidivists nationwide. Indeed, when it comes to obesity, parents are
incompetent at altering their children’s behavior.

 Most of the world views the word
behavior
 as meaning the actions we choose to do or not through “free will.” However,
the dictionary definition of behavior is: “a stereotyped motor response to a
physiological stimulus.” The operative word here is
physiological
.
Felix Kreier in Amsterdam argues that “behavior” is the sum output of the genetic,
hormonal, and biochemical inputs to the central nervous system that create specific
drives.

 What we call “behavior” is actually the cognitive inhibition on those
biochemical drives. Yes, you can choose to ignore your cravings and skip the cookie.
But can you really keep this up 24/7/365, when a hormone or a neurotransmitter is
telling you to act and when the signal gets stronger with time? This isn’t just thinking in
the abstract; it has real practical applications. Every human behavior requires hormonal
signals for expression (sexual behavior: androgen, estrogen; parental behavior:
oxytocin). These behaviors truly are innate; they are the product of our biochemistry,
which has developed evolutionarily for our survival. How else would parents not
abandon their screaming two-year-old? Their hormones make them protective and form
an immutable bond with their offspring. In one generation, our sugar glut has tweaked
related hormones and neural pathways to our detriment. Of course, there are exceptions
to this rule. But if the majority of us were able consistently to ignore our physiologic
responses screaming for that doughnut, there wouldn’t be a need for this book. Your
body will always work against you, and you’re doomed to fail.
The Way We Were
In trying to make sense of how all this works (or should I say
used to work
), I offer the
insights of Markus Stoffel of the University of Zurich. He recounted his childhood: He
ate lunch at noon, would get out of school at
three, and then rush straight to the
playground. For three hours, he and his classmates would play their hearts out and drink
water from the school fountain. At 6:00 p.m. they’d return to their homes famished.
“That six-hour interval of no food, only water, and vigorous activity was absolutely
essential…to keep our livers happy, refreshed, and insulin sensitive, so the next day we
could go at it all over again.”
Forty years ago, soda was a treat and available only in 12-ounce cans. With the
proliferation of the 2-liter soda bottle (patented by DuPont in 1973) and the Big Gulp,
we, like DeShawn, now chug sugar as if it were going out of style. Parents work two
jobs and don’t have time to cook meals; kids are more stressed; playgrounds have
disappeared due to housing and fear of crime, P.E. and sports have been slashed due to
budget cuts. Our hormones worked in our previous environment of thirty years ago.
They can still work, just not in the altered environment we have created for ourselves.
And the sooner we realize what we’ve done to ourselves and to our children in the
name of “progress,” the sooner we can unravel it. Because, thus far, finding methods to
adapt to our new environment has proven useless—witness the inefficacy of the
“obesity profiteers.” Face it: we’re stuck with our hormones and our biochemistry.
Many suffer from functional hormonal problems in one of the brain’s eating pathways—
hunger (
chapter 4
), reward (
chapter 5
), stress (
chapter 6
), or a combination of these
three.
For 50–60 percent of the obese population, the following interventions should do
the trick. For the rest of you, these interventions will be necessary, but likely not
sufficient. More drastic measures will be required (see
chapter 19
). To dig ourselves
out of this mess we need to fix the hormones to fix the behavior, and ultimately to fix
our health. And to do so, we need to fix our environment.
Making Hormones Work for You
The roles of specific hormones in weight gain and metabolic dysfunction were
elaborated in
chapters 4
–

. The goal of obesity management is to reverse the hormonal
dysfunction by accomplishing the following:
1.   Get the insulin down—to reduce your body fat and improve leptin resistance.
2.   Get the ghrelin down—to reduce hunger.
3.   Get the PYY up—to hasten satiety (the feeling of being full).
4.   Get the cortisol down—to reduce perceived stress and hunger, and reduce
deposition of energy into visceral fat.
1. Get the Insulin Down: Eat Fiber, Reduce Sugar, Exercise
For almost everyone, reducing insulin is the linchpin to success. Less insulin means
less shunting of energy to fat cells, improved leptin sensitivity, and a lower appetite. It
also means more energy available to muscles, which improves metabolic health and
quality of life. How to get insulin down? That means reducing insulin release or
improving insulin sensitivity, or both.
The best way to reduce insulin release is to limit the exposure of the pancreas to the
agent that drives insulin up, which is glucose. This means cutting back on refined
carbohydrates. Improving insulin sensitivity means improving hepatic, or muscle,
insulin sensitivity, or both. And each one is accomplished differently. Improving
hepatic insulin sensitivity means limiting the production of liver fat, which requires
limiting your liver’s exposure to fat and carbohydrates together (this is why most
popular diets work, see
chapter 17
). The best way to do this is to reduce your sugar
consumption, since this is always fat and carbohydrates combined. The easiest means
of accomplishing this feat is to remove sugared beverages from your house: soda, juice,
Vitamin Water, all of it. Stick with water and milk. A sugar-addicted parent (see
chapter 5
), similar to one who is drug addicted, will act as an “enabler,” “co-
dependent,” or “apologist” for her child. The job of the parent is to convert the house
from a minefield into a safe house for the child.
Another way to lower your insulin is to eat more fiber, which reduces flux to the
liver and the insulin response (see
chapter 12
). Opt for brown foods: beans, lentils,
whole grains, nuts, and other legumes. And eat the real stuff: the whole fruits and
vegetables rather than their processed or juiced derivatives. White food—bread, rice,
pasta, potatoes—means the fiber is gone (or, in the case of potatoes, was never there in
the first place).
Finally, improving muscle insulin sensitivity is very simple—only exercise will do
it, because once muscle fat is stored, the only way to get rid of it is to burn it off. Plus,
exercise will burn off liver fat as well.
2. Get the Ghrelin Down: Eat Breakfast with Protein,
Stop Nighttime Bingeing, and Sleep More
Reducing ghrelin, the hunger hormone (see
chapters 6
 and

), will diminish total food
intake at any given meal. And the best way to do so is to eat breakfast. If you don’t eat
breakfast, you don’t ratchet up your thermic effect of food (see
chapter 13
), ghrelin
levels keep rising as the morning drags on, and you will eat more at lunch, dinner, and
into the evening. Eating breakfast is part of the equation, but what you eat makes a huge
difference. A high-protein load has been shown to reduce ghrelin more than a meal high
in fat or carbohydrates,

 so you will burn more just sitting. Plus protein has a higher
thermic effect, meaning it costs double the energy to metabolize protein versus
carbohydrates. Plus protein doesn’t generate nearly as high an insulin response as do
carbohydrates, and doesn’t lead to your blood glucose crashing down, which makes you
hungry sooner. Bring on the bacon and eggs.
Some people with very severe insulin resistance, caused by overconsumption of
sugar, are enormously hungry—so hungry that standard mealtime changes won’t cut it.
The hallmark of this pattern is nighttime bingeing.

 When these patients awaken, they
are not hungry and usually go without breakfast (which is a warning sign for big
indiscretions later in the day). Indeed, they invariably eat before bed; some of them
even awaken from sleep to eat. Eating after dinnertime is problematic for everyone,
because any energy consumed that late will have no chance to be burned. It will find its
way either to the fat tissue or to the liver, making the patient even more insulin resistant.
Some of these patients also have obstructive sleep apnea, and virtually all of them have
metabolic syndrome. They are enormously fatigued and can’t find the ability to
exercise, due to both the excess insulin and the lack of sleep.
In order to improve their leptin resistance, which means improving their insulin
resistance, they must break this vicious cycle of nighttime
eating and energy storage.
The only hope these patients have is to readjust their mealtimes. This means eating a
sensible breakfast and lunch with no snacks added, and dinner must consistently occur a
good four hours before bedtime. Any late dalliances with food will only make matters
worse. These patients must also get consistent sleep, which can be very difficult due to
problems in their airways while sleeping (called obstructive sleep apnea). Patients
who snore (and in this category they all do) may need to see their doctor to get a
Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) machine to hold their airway open while
sleeping. Some patients may need a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy to create a larger
airway for better sleep.
3. Get the PYY Up: Eat Appropriate Portions, Wait Twenty Minutes for
Seconds, Eat Fiber
A kid eats a whole plate of food and says to her mother, “I’m still hungry.” Mom
doesn’t want her kid to starve, certainly doesn’t want any whining, and serves up
another portion. You parents out there, how many times has this happened to you?
Every day? Every meal? For adults, why do you devour a second hamburger
immediately after scarfing down the first? There is a huge difference between the
phenomenon of satiety versus the phenomenon of lack of hunger (see
chapter 12
).
Putting food in the stomach lowers your ghrelin, but that doesn’t stop you from eating
more. The signal for satiety—the switch that turns off the meal—is peptide YY
(3-36)
.
Between the stomach and the PYY cells are twenty-two feet of intestine. It takes time
for the food to get there. Give it a chance. The Japanese have a saying, “Eat until you
are 80 percent full.” This is very difficult to do in America. The key is to wait twenty
minutes for second portions. Also, make sure your first portion is an appropriate size—
even if you don’t go back for seconds, you’re going to do damage if you’ve supersized
your meal. The best way to get your PYY up is to make the food move through the
intestine faster, and that’s the job of fiber (see
chapter 12
). And the best way to get
fiber is to eat real food.
4. Get the Cortisol Down: Exercise
Now here’s the hard one. Cortisol is your short-term friend and your long-term enemy.
Keeping cortisol low, which means keeping stress down, is virtually impossible. There
are more stressors today than ever before, and no natural way to deal with them. Our
ancestors may have run away from the attacking lion, but it is considered poor form to
bolt full speed from your yelling boss. Stress-induced eating may be one of the toughest
challenges to overcome. First, because it’s not the stress, it’s the
response to stress
 that
matters (see
chapter 6
). This may be either genetically or prenatally determined (see
chapter 7
), and unlikely to respond to simple willpower. Second, since excess cortisol
drives visceral fat, insulin resistance, and further food intake, it’s the triple whammy
for metabolic syndrome. Finally, cortisol alters the output of the amygdala in a positive
feedback, or vicious cycle, manner, so that more cortisol results in more amygdala
activation, resulting in more cortisol the next time, and so on. Since nobody’s stress is
going away in this lifetime, the overeating won’t go away either. If you’ve got poor
coping mechanisms and everything in life is chaotic, it’s pretty hard to ignore your
troubles, and they tend to multiply.
There is one simple, cheap, and effective way to reduce your cortisol: exercise.
Although exercise raises your cortisol while you’re doing it (to mobilize glucose and
free fatty acids for energy), it reduces your cortisol levels for the rest of the day. It
burns off fat in your muscles to improve muscle insulin sensitivity, and in your liver to
improve hepatic insulin sensitivity. In our clinic, the rule is to buy your screen time
with activity. Every hour of TV or computer games means an hour of playing sports.
This is the hardest for families to do, because parents tend to use the TV as a babysitter,
and modern children tend to prefer playing sports with a joystick.
Many parents start dreaming about what college their child will attend before the
kid is out of the womb. Your children feel that stress—which affects their mood, their
actions, and their studies. The pressure on children today is enormous. Where can they
find the time for everything? Here’s perhaps the most important idea in this book for
raising children. If your child lays off the soft drinks and exercises, he will
create time.
If he exercises vigorously for one hour, his five hours of homework will take only four
hours because he will be more focused and efficient. He will have created time. There
are numerous studies from around the country documenting that increasing exercise
improves kids’ school performance and behavior. Parents, creating time is what life is
all about in the twenty-first century. You can’t increase the number of hours in the day,
but you can increase your child’s productivity.
Sadly, your kids’ school doesn’t get it. They’re saying, “We have to teach to the
test, otherwise No Child Left Behind will pull our funding.” Teachers, here’s what you
need to know: No Child Left Behind is really No Child Moving Forward and No
Teacher Left Standing. Teachers, exercise your kids during the school day. Lose forty-
five minutes from the daily schedule and devote it to real huffy-puffy, sweaty exercise.
The kids will do better in school and exhibit better behavior.
The Way We Need to Be
Processed food altered our current environment. All the pieces are available for us to
retool. For example, how about crockpot dinners made that morning? Salads don’t need
cooking—just be careful about the ingredients in the processed dressings. Kids need to
bring lunch from home and not purchased at school, where, with a few notable
exceptions, the food is highly processed, sugar-laden, frozen (so, it contains no fiber),
shipped cross-country, and just plain nasty. Like DeShawn’s mother, take the soda out
of the house. Try to ensure that your child doesn’t eat the home
and
 school lunch or
trade it with a classmate. Talk to your school principal about the food served at school;
the school can do better. Make sure the convenience food trucks don’t line up outside
the school waiting for kids to exit with dollars in their fists. If your kid is old enough,
how about having her cook for the family? She needs to learn sometime, or in college
the freshman 50 will no doubt replace the freshman 15. Of course, these changes are
applicable only to the middle and upper classes of society. The poor still do not have
access to healthy foods or areas in which to exercise. This is one of the many reasons
that public health solutions are also necessary (see
chapters 20
–

).
It’s the Hormones, Stupid…
There are two ways to look at how our environment relates to obesity. The first one
says that genes and behavior interact to drive weight gain. But both genes and behavior
are unalterable; so in this paradigm, all is lost. The second says that behavior is the
output of hormones (see
chapter 4
) and hormones are responsive to the environment.
Obesity is a hormonal problem, and hormones are alterable, so in hormones there is
hope. In this chapter, I’ve provided the rationale and methods to alter the environment,
for even the most recalcitrant of patients. But that doesn’t mean it will work. The
precepts will work for 60–70 percent of the obese population. Sadly, genetics,
epigenetics, developmental programming, and environmental obesogens can overwhelm
any environmental alteration. Sometimes medicine and surgery are necessary.
Chapter 19
O
Last Resorts: When Altering
Your Environment Isn’t Enough
Jared is a fifteen-year-old who has been obese his whole life. He is
very self-aware and knows the repercussions, both medically and
socially. We test him for genetic mutations, and nothing turns up. His
oral glucose tolerance test exhibits massive insulin release, but no
insulin resistance. We place him on octreotide, which stabilizes his
weight for a total of ten months; but then his weight continues to
increase. Other medicines are of no use. In his senior year of high
school, he undergoes a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB)
procedure. Over the next year, his appetite abates, his weight reduces
from 366 to 222 pounds. His mother reports, “We just went out to
dinner, and I overheard someone at the next table say, ‘What a good-
looking family,’ and I thanked God and started to cry.”
besity is not a behavior. It is not even a disease (as that would assume a common
pathophysiology). Indeed, obesity is a phenotype (a composite trait) of many
different pathologies. Remember, there are three different organ systems that could be
dysfunctional—the brain (see
chapters 4
–

); the fat (see
chapters 7
–

); or the hormones
that affect the brain or the fat (see
chapter 18
). Obesity was, is, and will be, forever.
But it need not exist at this frequency. The problems of hunger (hypothalamic
dysfunction), reward (nucleus accumbens dysfunction), or stress
(amygdala
dysfunction) can overwhelm just about anyone. And if you create extra fat cells along
the way (e.g., steroid use for cancer therapy, or extra insulin before birth due to the
mother’s prenatal diet or her gestational diabetes), those cells aren’t going to give up
their energy without a fight. Alterations in the food and hormonal environments will
work for 50–60 percent of the population, but there will still be people who can’t
overcome those biochemical forces. To the best of our ability, we need to determine the
individual basis for the obesity to best treat its underlying causes. Otherwise, we are
fighting the wrong problem. The key to successful therapy in these patients is accurate
diagnosis. Unfortunately, our diagnostic armamentarium is not yet fully developed, so
matching treatment to diagnosis remains uncertain.
There is not, and never will be, a magic bullet for obesity or metabolic syndrome,
especially if you consume four sodas a day. This chapter is written with the working
assumption that a formal six-to-twelve-month period of food and hormonal
environmental alteration—including psychodynamic, cognitive, and/or family therapy
where necessary—has been attempted, and has not been effective. What then? It’s time
to move to the bigger guns.
Drilling Down Through the Fat:
Laboratory Tests and Your Health
Chapter 8
 reviewed methods for ascertaining your level of visceral fat. Every other
method to assess your metabolic risk is relatively expensive and requires blood
drawing, specialized equipment, and/or professional data analysis. These tests and
their analysis should be left to your physician. But you should know what they mean, as
they are important for gauging your health.
The Lipid Conundrum
Virtually everyone in America now gets a fasting lipid profile (aka cholesterol test) to
assess their risk for heart disease. But there’s a lot more to the lipid profile than meets
the eye (see
chapter 10
), and this field is continually evolving. In the 1970s, scientists
determined that LDL (low-density
lipoproteins) were the bad type of cholesterol,
whereas HDL (high-density lipoproteins) were beneficial. In the early 2000s, we
learned that the triglyceride (TG) level also correlated with heart disease risk,
especially in light of the obesity pandemic. The TG-to-HDL ratio is a surrogate marker
of oxidized LDL (the LDL that lines arteries), insulin resistance, and metabolic
syndrome. When you get a fasting lipid profile, your doctor needs to look at
all
 the
lipid fractions, as they cannot be viewed in isolation.
Alanine Aminotranferase (ALT)
Diagnosing metabolic syndrome is all about assessing the fat in the liver.

 While not
specific for liver fat accumulation, the liver enzyme ALT is easy to assess and is a
good predictor of future diabetes.

 Most doctors get nervous with an ALT above 40, but
recent data argue that even an ALT of 25 predicts liver fat.
Fasting Insulin, Glucose, and Hemoglobin A
1c
Every doctor gets a fasting glucose on his adult patients, looking for type 2 diabetes.
This parameter is the very last one to change; by the time it has gone south, metabolic
syndrome is in full force, and there are no options for prevention anymore. The body
will do everything it can to maintain the serum glucose in the normal range, including
increasing the insulin. (That’s insulin resistance!) So the way to interpret a fasting
glucose is by getting a simultaneous fasting insulin level, which tells you how hard the
pancreas is working. However, a fasting insulin will tell you only about insulin
resistance. It won’t tell you about excessive pancreatic insulin secretion.
In our clinic, we assume insulin resistance when we see a patient for the first time,
because it is so common. If the patient responds to an environmental intervention (see
chapter 18
), there is no further need for testing. If she doesn’t, we use an oral glucose
tolerance test to see if she releases too much insulin

 (see
chapter 4
), and then
determine the best course of therapy to lower insulin release.
Doctors have started to screen patients with hemoglobin A
1c
 (HbA
1c
), the blood test
that assesses glucose control over the preceding three months
and is used to monitor
diabetic patients. By everyone’s estimation, under 5.5 percent is normal, over 6.5
percent is diabetes, while 6.0–6.5 percent requires a glucose tolerance test to
determine if diabetes is present.

Inflammation Markers
Metabolic syndrome is also about inflammation and cell damage. All these tests (such
as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) are very expensive, none is paid for by standard
commercial insurance, and none has been shown to predict with precision the timing of
a heart attack or stroke. Thus, while they show promise, all tests remain subjects of
research and have not yet been adopted clinically.
Seeing Is Believing: Imaging Studies
When it comes to obesity, a picture truly is worth a thousand words. Is there any way to
tell what your belly and your liver are up to? Yes, but they are all expensive, research-
based, and not likely to be readily available soon. Liver ultrasounds have a high
specificity for detecting fatty liver (meaning when it’s there, you can see it), but the
sensitivity is relatively low (meaning that you can think it’s there, but it’s not). Another
test is called dual emission X-ray absorpiometry (DEXA). While fat tissue can very
easily and nicely be quantified, it’s impossible to tell what type it is (subcutaneous,
visceral, or liver), so such a measure is of limited use. Two more methods are CT and
MRI of the abdomen, which can differentiate the different storehouses of fat. Both MRI
and CT cost more than $1,000 a pop and are not covered by insurance, which puts them
out of the reach of most patients.
Once you know whether you’re fat or sick or both, and once your doctor has ruled
out specific genetic or biochemical abnormalities, you and your doctor can make a
conscious decision as to the most appropriate mode of therapy, and how best to monitor
your progress.
The Obesity Drug Pipeline—a Trickle, Not a Gusher
Sadly, drug therapy for obesity has hit the skids. It seems incredible that in the face of
the relative lack of efficacy of lifestyle interventions, the ever-expanding knowledge of
the physiology of energy balance, and a veritable gold mine for successful candidates,
most pharmaceutical companies have closed their obesity research programs.
A new anticancer therapy that can show an increase in survival for four extra
months can get FDA approval despite severe side effects, yet the bar has been set so
high on obesity drugs that any that demonstrate even the slightest toxicity are doomed to
failure. The FDA is tasked to do a cost-benefit analysis on every new drug. Are the
potential side effects worth the risk? FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg believes
that obesity is about “making healthy choices,” therefore, why would you need drugs?
There are numerous medications for the diseases within metabolic syndrome, but
virtually none targeting patients before these illnesses develop. The FDA has recently
withdrawn three medications (ephedrine, sibutramine, and phenylpropanolamine) due
to concerns over potential toxicity. Only orlistat (Xenical or its over-the-counter
version, Alli) is still with us. It barely works, has adverse effects galore, and is in a
fight for its life over possible liver toxicity. The FDA recently voted down three
combination drugs (although one of these, phentermine-topiramate, or Qsymia, made it
through on the second try in 2012). And they just gave the go-ahead to lorcaserin in July
2012.
What’s Left of Pharmacotherapy—Last Drug Standing?
This leaves very few medications to talk about. Furthermore, obesity drugs don’t have a
great track record. Energy balance is so crucial to survival that we want to hold on to
our fat at any cost. Every obesity drug works for about four months, and then that
negative plateau kicks in (see
chapter 4
). Every drug has side effects, some of them
serious. Each drug is tested in combination with a low-calorie diet, therefore every
drug must currently be considered an adjunct to standard environmental modification,
which is not the way people use them in real life. You have to do the right
thing
anyway. Obesity drugs work on different aspects of energy balance. Currently, the
approaches are: reducing calories eaten (phentermine), reducing energy absorbed
(orlistat), increasing energy expended (nothing left here), and improving either insulin
resistance (metformin) or suppression of insulin release (a low-carb diet).
While many new drugs are currently under study, and many of them are attempts at
targeted therapy, proof of safety and efficacy are hard to come by. One reason is that
obesity is not one disease but many, so each drug will work only in a percentage of
people. Another reason is that the mechanisms to maintain your weight are redundant
and strong, so treating one pathway is often not enough. Many experts have abandoned
the idea of a big blockbuster agent that will “cure” obesity,

 and have instead started
advocating combination drugs that target different parts of the energy balance pathway.
But that means drug companies would have to work together, which is like expecting
Apple to love Microsoft. And that means no home runs, only the occasional single. Just
as in baseball, don’t expect the pharmaceutical houses to invest the bankroll for a
singles hitter.
Bariatric Surgery—Not a “Magic Scalpel”
In adults with comorbidities and in adolescents with extreme and life-threatening
obesity, surgical therapy may be necessary. Bariatric surgery can not only promote
weight loss, but also reverse type 2 diabetes in up to 50 percent of patients, and might
help you live longer.

 Yet it is virtually impossible to perform randomized controlled
trials of bariatric surgery due to ethical concerns; you can’t do a sham surgery on
people. And no studies take the causes or mechanisms of the obesity into account. So
the efficacy of targeting any approach to any given patient will continue to be suspect.
Bariatric surgery is most effective in preventing the development of the various
comorbidities associated with obesity before they take hold, such as diabetes and
obstructive sleep apnea. By the time you have developed these disorders, surgery may
improve them but will likely not reverse their presence. However, many insurance
companies will not approve this procedure until you qualify with one of these life-
threatening diseases.
Also, if you wait until you are severely obese (more than 450
pounds), you are unable to have the surgery anyway, as you cannot fit in an MRI
scanner, which is needed to observe your post-op progress. A catch-22.
In adolescents, performing surgery early in the game (only among the severely
obese) will likely add years to their lives. They may even be spared the ravages of
metabolic syndrome. However, the insurance company will opt to wait as long as
possible, when the patient is no longer covered under his parents’ insurance. Therefore,
guidance is needed to determine the ideal circumstances when the balance of risk
versus benefit favors health improvement and reversion of complications, yet with the
lowest risk of morbidity and mortality.
Surgical outcomes in adults vary between surgeons and institutions. The only
method to validate and refine the use of these procedures comes from following
patients carefully and long term,

 which is of no use to the patients undergoing surgery
today. It is absolutely essential that bariatric surgery be performed in regionalized
academic centers with programs equipped to handle the data acquisition, long-term
follow-up, and multidisciplinary nature of these difficult patients.

 However, by
restricting the number of sites, you limit the number of surgeries that can be performed,
and access to them.
One of the biggest public misconceptions is that bariatric surgery consistently
works in the long term. That’s the party line toed by the media, the bariatric centers,
celebrities such as Al Roker, Sharon Osbourne, and Star Jones, and the “cut-and-run”
surgeons. But for how long? Virtually everyone loses weight for the first twelve
months.

 But the real story is told after the one-year breakpoint. Up to 33 percent of
patients gain much if not all their weight back.

 The stomach can easily restretch to
accommodate excessive food intake. In many procedures, the stomach is reduced from
the size of a baseball glove to that of a golf ball. The sensation of hunger is reduced,
and the feeling of fullness is achieved after smaller portions are consumed. Great. But,
as mentioned, many of the obese don’t only eat when they are hungry. The underlying
causes of the obesity—the “behaviors” of reward and stress (see
chapters 5
 and

)—
are not even remotely alleviated by these procedures, and not addressed by most
patients or doctors. And the procedure doesn’t prevent you from drinking your calories,
which will
bring you back to your initial weight even faster. These patients need long-
term psychotherapy in addition to surgery. The point is that bariatric surgery is an
adjunct to dietary and environmental change, not a “magic scalpel.”
You Can Pay Me Now, or You Can Pay Me Later
Very few people can afford to have these procedures, as they can cost anywhere from
$15,000 to $40,000 just for the surgery, let alone the pre-op evaluation, any
complications, and the long-term follow-up. If Al Roker and Sharon Osbourne can get
it, why can’t you? Because your insurance company doesn’t want to pay for it. Yet
several cost-benefit analyses have been done that say that bariatric surgery increases
both longevity and quality of life.

 It actually reduces health-related costs, especially
those associated with treating type 2 diabetes. And the strain on the medical system—
by 2030 we will be taking care of a hundred million diabetics in the United States
alone—might just ease slightly.
Bariatric Procedures
Bariatric procedures (colloquially referred to as “stomach stapling”) can be divided
into malabsorptive (food goes out in the stool), restrictive (food can’t get into the
stomach), and a combination of the two. Purely malabsorptive procedures (such as the
duodenal switch and the jejuno-ileal bypass) have extremely high morbidity and
mortality, and cannot be recommended. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a
combination procedure, which not only leads to extraordinary weight loss but can
reverse type 2 diabetes as well.

 The restrictive procedures reduce stomach volume to
decrease the volume of food ingested. They include the Bioenteric Intragastric Balloon
(BIB),

 laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB),

 and sleeve gastrectomy
(SG).

 Unfortunately, the general safety of these procedures correlates inversely with
the degree of weight loss—the safer the procedure, the less weight lost—so there is no
“favored” type.
Bariatric Surgery in Children
Unlike with adults, stricter and more conservative criteria must be applied to
adolescents, since only 85 percent of obese adolescents will become obese adults; the
slightly improved rate of lifestyle and pharmacotherapeutic efficacy versus that of
adults; a longer time interval before comorbidities become life-threatening; and
children’s inability to give legal consent. For all these reasons, an expert panel with
representation from the American Pediatric Surgical Association and the American
Academy of Pediatrics has suggested that bariatric surgery for adolescents should be
done only in institutions committed to long-term management of these patients,

 and is
justified in situations when obesity-related comorbid conditions (such as obstructive
sleep apnea) threaten the child’s health. While I must accede to this view, my personal
feeling is that usually the horse is out of the barn by then. Waiting until a child is fully
grown can mean many more pounds and much more comorbidity, which could be
avoided by confronting the problem earlier. It is easier to stabilize weight gain than it is
to induce weight loss. But the degree to which this surgery should be used as a solution
will have to wait until we have further data.
Last Resorts versus First Passes
The fact that any of the medications or procedures in this chapter exist, let alone are
common, speaks to the breakdown of our energy balance pathway and the alterations in
our environment that have led to that breakdown. These last resorts are clearly
necessary for the 5 percent of the population who have a biochemical abnormality, and
who would have been obese ten, one hundred, or even a thousand years ago. But for the
other 95 percent of people, of whom 60 percent are overweight or obese, and for the 40
percent of normal-weight people who have metabolic syndrome, do we have to jump to
last resorts first? Do we have the money for last resorts for every obese patient in
America? Clearly, something needs to happen on the first pass. And that’s where public
health comes in.
Part 6
 will make the argument that public health is our best and only
chance worldwide to turn this juggernaut around.

The Public Health Solution
Chapter 20
W
The “Nanny State”:
Personal versus Societal Responsibility
“The proverb warns that, ‘you should not bite the hand that feeds you.’
But maybe you should—if it prevents you from feeding yourself.”
—Thomas Szasz, psychiatrist and social critic, author of
The Myth of
Mental Illness
 (1960) and
The Manufacture of Madness: A
Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health
Movement
 (1970)
e live in a cop-out culture. We espouse personal liberty and responsibility. The
American Dream tells us that any citizen can be president one day. Our libertarian
leanings dictate that we are in control of ourselves and of our lives. Any challenge to
our personal authority is unwanted, unwelcome, and considered un-American. Until the
bottom drops out, and then we look for someone to blame, and demand increased
regulation. Occupy Wall Street is a perfect example.
Personal Responsibility versus Public Health
Our libertarian philosophy says, “You, and only you, are in charge of your own health.
Public health is the medical manifestation of the ‘nanny state.’” Public health is
concerned with the health of the entire community, not just the individual. It has been
said that “health care is vital to all of us some of the time, but public health is vital to
all of us all the time.” How dare the school district demand that my children be
immunized? How dare
the airport official confiscate my pineapple at the Honolulu
Airport? How dare the state check me for syphilis before I get married? Acute public
health problems always occur to someone else. Someone else gets TB from bad
hygiene. Someone else gets lockjaw from stepping on a rusty nail. It’s your choice,
right? Yet your opinion generally changes when you’re the one who gets sick or it is
your child who dies of Rubella because either he or his classmate went unvaccinated.
And that’s the paradox of public health; it’s always somebody else’s problem…until
it’s yours. Same with obesity.
If We’re All Co-Opted, Who’s the Nanny?
Ultimately, how well our society does in solving the obesity pandemic depends on its
responses to the following questions. Which of the following is the fault of the
individual? When a kid’s brain thinks it’s starving? When the American Academy of
Pediatrics still recommends juice for toddlers, and the American College of Obstetrics
and Gynecology still recommends juice for pregnant women? When the first ingredient
in barbecue sauce is high-fructose corn syrup and when soda is cheaper than either milk
or water? When high-fiber fresh produce is unavailable in poor neighborhoods due to
lack of supermarkets and associated costs? When the local fast food restaurant is the
only neighborhood venue that is clean and air-conditioned? When in order to meet the
criteria for No Child Left Behind, and in the face of budget cuts, the school does away
with P.E.? When children are not allowed out of the house to play, for fear of crime?
All health debacles were originally categorized as personal travails before they
were declared public health issues. Cholera, tuberculosis, lead poisoning, vitamin
deficiencies, pollution/asthma—these were all considered “personal responsibility”
before the sheer magnitude of morbidity or mortality commanded governmental
intervention. In each case, the science had to be elaborated before rational
governmental policies could be designed and implemented. And in each case, politics
initially stood in the way, on either economic or religious grounds. Vaccinations are
important not only for the individual but also for the community as a whole. It’s known
as “herd immunity.” As a result of regulations and sometimes forced
vaccinations, we
have nearly eradicated polio and other highly infectious diseases. Teen pregnancy was
going up at an alarming rate in America from the 1960s through the 1980s. Similarly,
HIV/AIDS ran rampant through the 1980s. Both were assumed to be matters of personal
responsibility. It wasn’t until Surgeon General C. Everett Koop convinced the nation
that AIDS was a public health crisis on the basis of the science of HIV propagation, and
needed to be responded to as such, that we started to see a decline in the prevalence of
either one.
And then there are the chronic public health problems that transpire among the
unsuspecting populace. Witness the increased incidence of cancer in the inhabitants of
Love Canal. Or the epidemic of spina bifida in newborns as a result of their mothers
being deficient in folic acid. Or the incidence of asthma in the survivors of the attacks
on the World Trade Center on 9/11. Sometimes it requires public outcry to coerce the
government into action—witness regulations on lead paint and the removal of asbestos.
And finally, there are the two biggest public health demons that now exist
worldwide: tobacco and alcohol. Use of tobacco or alcohol is clearly a personal issue
—except that it isn’t. Tobacco and alcohol abuse elevate to public health status for two
reasons:
your
 smoking and drinking affect
me
 (also known as externalities; see
chapter

), and tobacco and alcohol are both addictive substances. Addictive substances
thwart all attempts at arguing solely for personal responsibility. Virtually every
substance that activates the nucleus accumbens (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, morphine,
heroin, nicotine, alcohol) has required both a personal intervention—for lack of a
better word, rehab—and some sort of public health intervention to control the
environment, called laws. For instance, alcohol-control policies are in place in every
country around the globe, along with an extensive body of evidence documenting
strategic efficacy (see
chapter 22
). Tobacco-control policies have lagged behind, but
they are catching up worldwide as well. Even Italy has recognized that the health care
dollars saved by tobacco control more than justify the
stato di bambinaia
.
Do Nannies Know Best?
Within the last twenty years, the government has stepped in to curtail tobacco
advertising targeted at youth. Camel has long since admitted that its icon, Joe Camel,
was designed to be “cool” to children and adolescents. Recognizing that this was a
public health issue, tobacco advertisements were bannd from television and billboards
near schools.
Which brings us to our food supply. I think we can all agree that the global obesity
pandemic is a monumental public health disaster. Although most people are
comfortable with food safety as a public health issue, many critics warn that regulating
food quality is the most egregious reach of the “nanny state.” But, in fact, the FDA was
created to keep our food supply safe. I would argue that food quality is equivalent to
long-term
 food safety. My daughter got
E. coli
 from an undercooked hamburger at a
Girl Scout picnic in 2008. While
E. coli
 will make you very sick, the probability is it
won’t kill you. And it wouldn’t cause the death of millions, because the FDA would
step in and recall the tainted product, as it did with tainted spinach in 2010.
Unfortunately, the FDA stands idly by while our current food supply is slowly
poisoning the majority of the U.S. population.
Is Our Food Supply Tainted?
What if our breakfast cereal were laced with heroin by some unscrupulous food
company? Isn’t it the role of government to protect us? If Coca-Cola hadn’t taken the
cocaine out of its cola in 1903, the U.S. government certainly would have. And we have
learned from tobacco documents how the industry manipulated nicotine levels to
increase the addictive potential of cigarettes. One similarity in the industrialization of
drugs of abuse versus fast food is the addition of other compounds to increase saliency.
For instance, menthol is frequently added to cigarettes. In 2011 the Tobacco Products
Scientific Advisory Committee of the FDA showed that “menthol has cooling and
anesthetic effects that reduce that harshness of cigarette smoke,” and that this effect
“could facilitate initiation or early persistence of smoking by youth.”

Similarly, food processors use additives to enhance flavor, color, texture, shelf life,
and other attributes of palatability. For example, the presence of HFCS in fast food
hamburger buns increases the sweet flavor and extends shelf life. Similarly, trans fats
are superior for deep-frying (as with doughnuts and French fries) because they oxidize
less readily than vegetable oils. In one study examining how fast food restaurants plan
their menus, senior executives identified shelf life and spoilage as major obstacles to
offering healthier items.

 In the end, food processing results in combinations and
concentrations of nutrients that are not present in nature, and that possess potential for
abuse.
To the extent that sugar acts on the same reward pathways as drugs of abuse (see
chapter 5
) and poses the same harms to health, we must start wondering whether it
should also be subject to public health controls. Yet in contrast to alcohol and tobacco,
regulatory controls on sugar and sugar-containing processed foodstuffs are virtually
nonexistent (see
chapter 21
).
Economic Freedom Doesn’t Work with Addictive
Substances
Economists (and food companies) routinely invoke the rule of the free market to govern
the sales of food around the world. This makes perfect sense, except when it doesn’t.
Addictive substances don’t follow the free market. As an example, in the midst of the
economic recession and in the face of stiff competition from competitors, Starbucks
raised its prices on coffee even though jet fuel prices took a nosedive. Apparently,
spending six dollars a day on coffee is now common practice, just as George Carlin
predicted.

 Sugar is no different: its cost does not follow the free market. After all,
would you really spend five dollars for a box of cereal or one dollar for a can of soda
if it did? Despite the Great Recession, Americans have continued, if not increased,
their consumption of addictive substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and chocolate.
Coincidence?
We’re Already Living in the Nanny State
The food industry currently has carte blanche over what can be put in a food and how it
can be processed, packaged, and marketed. This has worked very well by increasing
sales, decreasing depreciation, and expanding markets worldwide. The food industry
has a vested interest in blocking any form of regulation, no matter the consequences on
our public health. It has set up political action groups to help sway the populace into
believing that any regulation is an affront to your liberty and an example of the “nanny
state” in action. An example of such propaganda is the Center for Consumer Freedom
(CCF), a nonprofit lobby group that serves as a front for the food industry. The purpose
of CCF is to “defend the right of adults and parents to choose how they live their lives,
what they eat and drink, how they manage their finances, and how they enjoy
themselves.” Their job is to convince you, the public, that you have the inalienable right
to choose and eat any food product you wish, irrespective of its calorie content, sugar
content, toxicity, abuse, or environmental impact.
That would be a great selling point if you actually had access and choice to
all
foods. But you don’t. Unless you grow it yourself, you have only the access the food
industry supplies to you. Barry Popkin of the University of North Carolina states that of
the six hundred thousand food items for sale in the United States, 80 percent are laced
with added sugar. Ninety percent of the food produced in the United States is sold to
you by a total of
ten
 conglomerates—Coca-Cola, ConAgra, Dole, General Mills,
Hormel, Kraft, Nestle, Pepsico, Procter and Gamble, and Unilever. And the poor have
only the foods they can get through SNAP and WIC, nearly all of which are processed
and loaded with sugar for reduced depreciation. The point is, if you want to avoid
sugar, you can’t, because we already live in the nanny state. In fact, I would submit that
by promoting the availability and consumption of real food, I am doing more to reverse
the nanny state than any corporate entity, irrespective of advertising budgets or taglines;
and than any government entity, irrespective of price controls or subsidies.
It’s a War, and They’re Winning
When it comes right down to it, it’s really only about money—how to turn your money
into their money.
Figure 20.1
 demonstrates the stock price of McDonald’s, Coca-Cola,
and PepsiCo as compared to the Standard and Poor 500 (S&P) as a percent change
over the last five years. Despite the economic downturn that occurred in 2008, which
has kept the stock market depressed, food-processing companies have consistently
outperformed the S&P. Want to make money? Invest in a food company.
Personal Responsibility versus Public Funding for Health
Care
Personal responsibility is a core American value. Personal responsibility and
capitalism go hand in hand—take the risk, make the money. This allows the food
industry to espouse their mantra: “Any food can be part of a balanced diet,” including
sugar. And since sugar is addictive, we’ll eat it
at any concentration and at any cost. It
allows the pharmaceutical industry a bigger market. It allows the propagation of the
“obesity profiteers.” When the government intervenes at all, it conveniently leaves
itself out. Witness Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign, which says, focus on the
individual, focus on the family, focus on the community. Missing from this equation are
government and the food industry. It’s a good show, gets a lot of airtime, and makes it
look like something is happening—because it’s deemed “personal responsibility.”
Necessary, but not sufficient.
 And nothing changes.
Fig. 20.1. Who’s Winning the War?
 Changes in the stock price of McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, and Pepsico for the
years 2007–2011, in comparison with the S&P 500 Index. Despite the economic downturn of 2008, stock prices of
McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Pepsico, and other food companies—ConAgra, General Mills, Hormel, Kraft, and Procter
and Gamble not shown—all outstripped the S&P 500 over this time interval.
Forget the philosophical argument. Why should the government rethink obesity?
Because it pays twice. First, it pays $20 billion for the annual corn and soybean
subsidies, way more than for tobacco. Second, it pays for the emergency room visits for
the strokes, heart attacks, and dialysis. A. B. Shaw, a British physician, once said,
“Aortic valve operations on the elderly are very cost-effective if the result is death or
cure instead of prolonged illness.” If you can fix a chronic disease, it’s worth the
money to do it. But we can’t cure cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney
disease, or dementia. These diseases are eating away our health care dollars faster than
we can print the money to pay for them.

These are big numbers, and they’re getting bigger every year. And this is happening
to twenty- to forty-year-olds who will be sick for twenty to forty years. President
Obama based the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, or “Obamacare”)
on the notion that there would be major cost savings in providing preventive services.
If we continue to subsidize corn, promote processed food, and espouse personal
responsibility for obesity, there won’t be any prevention. Worker productivity will
continue to decline, preventable chronic disease rates will continue to rise, and
Medicare will be broke by the year 2024.

 That’s the outcome of “personal
responsibility” with public funding. You can’t have it both ways.
We really have only two choices. It’s either personal responsibility all the way—if
you get sick, you pay or you die. That’s the Russian system. And of course it’s done
wonders for curbing their alcoholism, hasn’t it? Or it’s public health all the way—and
we all get behind some
societal interventions that can tame this beast.
The Nanny’s Charges
Societal interventions can target either the affected individual or the entire population.
There are strengths and limitations to both strategies, as listed in
table 20.1
.
Table 20.1: Strengths and Limitations of Personal versus Societal Interventions
for Obesity
Strengths
Limitations
Personal interventions: Focus on the individual
•  Targets care only to the obese
patient
•  Patient is medicalized and demonized—“it’s your fault”
•  Limits money spent to those
affected by obesity
•  Offers no prevention for those who will be affected in the future—all
those “flippers”(thin people who became fat along the way)
•  Is easy to incorporate into medical
care
•  High costs and questions about feasibility
•  Has clear and favorable risk-to-
benefit ratio
•  Emphasizes behavior modification, which has limited success in a “toxic
environment”

•  Doesn’t help thin people with metabolic disease
Societal interventions: Focus on the environment
•  Regulates quality of food nationally,
improving health of everyone
•  Must be acceptable to the general population; challenges the electability of
politicians
•  Changes food structure and
availability
•  Must be feasible; pushback expected from food companies and the
addicted populace

•  Costs are prohibitive
While it might be more palatable to the populace to focus specifically on the obese,
such across-the-board labeling may be too pejorative to be effective. Furthermore,
don’t forget that 20 percent of the obese population doesn’t need targeted health care
intervention, while 40 percent of normal-weight people need it, and won’t get it. Lastly,
altering
one person’s food environment is downright impossible. It’s way easier to
alter everyone’s food environment at the same time. I offer the next two chapters as a
smorgasbord of ideas to think about in order to help rescue our brethren and our
economy before they both collapse under their own weight.
Chapter 21
I
What Hath Government Wrought?
The Hyderabad Statement: “All significant public health
interventions involve and require the use of law.”
In 2000, the Memphis Area Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,
with which I was affiliated, obtained an audience with the Memphis
Board of Aldermen. We discussed the increase in the obesity epidemic
coincident with the transition of the lowest-income neighborhood into a
“food desert.” The withdrawal of the only supermarket and the
proliferation of fast food concessions were in part responsible for this
change. We argued for zoning restrictions on the density of fast food
establishments in these neighborhoods. One of the senior aldermen
calmly asked the question “You want to take away the single thing in
these people’s lives that gives them pleasure?”
didn’t have an answer for that question then and I’m not sure I have one now. If the
goal is short-term pleasure, the alderman is right. If the goal is for business to make
money, he is also right. But if the goal is health; happiness; medical, economic, and
social justice; and overall societal benefit, then his is just the type of thinking that
prevents us from achieving it.
“Government Is Not the Solution to Our Problem,
Government
Is
 the Problem”
In no arena has President Reagan’s signature quote been truer than in the government’s
passive role fomenting the obesity epidemic. Throughout our history, bills and
programs designed and funded with the best of intentions have been adulterated and
abused by multiple stakeholders, each with a hand out (see
chapter 2
), and with no
interest in a mutually beneficial solution.
Joseph, Pharaoh, and the Farm Bill
Our nutritional crisis is the long-term result of the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill is one of
the most complex and antiquated pieces of renewable legislation that Congress
approves every five years. It was developed in the 1930s for two reasons: First, we
had family farmers who were succumbing to a double whammy, the Depression and the
Dust Bowl. Second, we had a hungry and destitute population. The country needed
cheap calories, and that meant storable commodities: wheat, rice, soybeans, corn,
grains you can put in silos or ship around the country without fear of spoilage. This
happened in ancient Egypt when, in Genesis 41:33–36, Joseph told Pharaoh he would
need to store grain in preparation for seven years of famine. Crops without a lot of
water that don’t shrivel up when you dry them. Not a green vegetable in the bunch.
The Farm Bill was developed with subsidies for all forms of storable
carbohydrate. This produced a glut of high-glucose foodstuffs, which, over time, meant
two things—we had to find new uses for them (e.g., ethanol for cars) and we had to get
people to eat more of them. Here we find the basis for our current nutritional policy and
the reason that grains have formed the basis of the USDA Food Pyramid for decades: an
antiquated, unneeded policy that needs big-time reform, and one that rewards the richest
10 percent of farmers. But because the midwestern agricultural states maintain so much
political clout, with two senators per state despite their sparse populations, tinkering
with the Farm Bill remains political suicide. Try it at your own risk.
A recent report entitled “Apples to Twinkies: Comparing Federal Subsidies of
Fresh Produce and Junk Food” documents a five-year allocation of $16.9 billion for
corn and soy syrups and oils versus a total of $262 million for apples. At the individual
level, that’s $7.36 per year for junk food (worth nineteen Twinkies) and $0.11 per year
for apples (worth a quarter of one apple),

 or as Michael Pollan succinctly put it, “If
you’ve got one dollar to spend on food, are you going to buy 1200 calories in potato
chips or 200 calories in carrots?”
A total of $190 billion (two thirds) of the Farm Bill is used for nutrition programs,
primarily for the indigent—such as SNAP, WIC, the Emergency Food Assistance
Program, and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). The goals for these
programs are all the same: provide cheap nutrition with all the subsidized excess food.
For instance, WIC was created to prevent “failure to thrive” in babies born to poor
mothers. Unfortunately, the epidemic of obesity in poor children is the equal and
opposite reaction. Until 2007, fruit juice was in the WIC portfolio, but fruit was not—
because fruit juice was cheap and fruit was not. Indeed, frozen orange juice is traded on
the commodities exchange, but fruit isn’t. And even though fruit is now available
through WIC, kids and mothers are still voting with their feet and choosing fruit juice
anyway, for convenience and reward.
The final and most insidious reason is that badmouthing the food industry or the
Farm Bill is the “third rail” of American politics. Because it’s all about Iowa. Iowa is
the first presidential contest for both parties. And that means no one wants to diss corn,
or any corn-based product. In May 2011, I shared the dais at a Culinary Institute of
America meeting with Sam Kass, of Michelle Obama’s Childhood Obesity Task Force.
Kass is not just any old chef. He is a very good-looking, smart, eloquent, and
charismatic dude. I got twenty minutes alone with him, and he admitted to me that
everyone in the White House, including the president, had read the
New York Times
Magazine
 article “Is Sugar Toxic?” (April 17, 2011), in which our UCSF research is
featured. They wish me well—and they will do absolutely nothing to help. Not a plug,
not a wink, not a nod. Nothing. Because they don’t want the fight; this administration
has enough enemies. I’m on my own, and you’re on your own.
The FDA and the 1986 Fructose-GRAS Determination
Designation of a food additive as “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) by the FDA
allows food manufacturers to use any amount of it in food preparation without concern.
Sugar was afforded GRAS status back in 1958, owing to its natural origin and long
history of use, rather than to any science or toxicological analysis. In 1983 the FDA
granted GRAS status to HFCS as well. Under pressure from a committee from the
Federation of Experimental Biology, the FDA commissioned a “final” report on the
effects of sugars on health. Led by Walter H. Glinsmann, a food scientist and FDA
administrator (and now on the board of directors of the Corn Refiners Association—
coincidence?), the authors of the 1986 report affirmed that “high fructose [corn] syrup
is as safe for use in food as sucrose, corn syrup and invert sugar (the breakdown
product of sucrose).”

 The report also concluded that “fructose is a valuable,
traditional source of food energy, and there is no basis for recommending increases or
decreases in its use in the general food supply or in special dietary use products.” In
fact, the only problem sugar afforded humans was tooth decay, and that was easily
solved by water fluoridation.
There are three problems with this determination. First, the data came way before
the sugar glut. The report’s correlations were based on the 1980s average sugar
consumption of 40 pounds per person per year, which accounted for 200 calories per
day, well within the American Heart Association upper-limit recommendations.

 We’re
now at 130 pounds per person per year. Second, the authors of the report were looking
at obesity, not metabolic syndrome—the term hadn’t even been coined until 1988. And
fructose does not specifically cause obesity; it turns obesity into metabolic syndrome.
Lastly, like Ancel Keys (see
chapter 10
), they had no way to separate the effect of fat
from the effect of sugar. In other words, they just plain missed the boat. Which is
understandable, considering the science available at the time. But things have changed:
obesity is rampant, and people are dying. Nonetheless, the FDA reaffirmed its stance in
1996 and again in 2004.

 In response to our argument over the toxicity of sugar in the
journal
Nature
,

 an FDA spokesperson publicly stated that there are no plans to revisit
this issue. Other countries have also turned a deaf ear to concerns about sugar. The
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued a
statement in 2010 that it had found no
scientific evidence to recommend a limit on the amount of sugar people should
consume.

Sugar Tariffs and Crony Capitalism
Sugar tariffs are the longest-running U.S. policy of all, dating back to 1789, when the
First Congress imposed a tariff upon foreign sugar to raise revenue for the fledgling
government. Since then, the sugar tariffs have expanded to increase competition with
other subsidized countries, to provide protection for American jobs, and to make money
for sugar czars to funnel back to politicians. Sugar is produced in 18 states, supports
146,000 U.S. jobs, and contributes $10 billion to the economy each year.
Due to the sugar tariffs, U.S. sugar prices currently are at or near record highs.
Consumers on the world market pay $0.34 per pound for refined sugar, which is $0.20
less than Americans pay. While sugar tariffs generated $2.5 billion in 2009,

 America’s
artificial price prop adds $1.4 billion to the shopping bills of U.S. consumers each
year. All this has made a lot of people very wealthy. If these sugar tariffs actually
reduced sugar consumption, I would be a proponent. But they don’t. Despite the tariffs,
the United States consumes more sugar per capita than any other country (see
chapters

 and

). One reason is our addiction to sugar. The other is that the food industry has
a very cheap alternative to sucrose in the form of HFCS.
The Executive Branch: Feeding the Food Industry
The executive branch has a vested interest in maintaining our current food structure and
supply. To them, it’s all about money and jobs. U.S. consumers spend approximately $1
trillion annually on food, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP), and 6 percent of our exports revolve around food, accounting for
another $56 billion. More than 16.5 million Americans are employed in the food
industry,

 and this number is not expected to decline over the next decade. The
government will go to great lengths to keep us consuming at the same, if not increased,
rates. And nearly all our consumption includes some sort of sugar. Yet the executive
branch also doles out $147 billion annually in health care, most of it for chronic
disease. It is in a no-win situation, and so the government tries to play both sides.
Sugar Extortion: The George W. Bush Administration versus the World
Health Organization
In 2002, WHO and FAO convened a policy forum to address the role of nutrition in
disease. They produced Technical Report Series (TRS) 916, entitled “Diet, Nutrition,
and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases.”

 This document created a firestorm of
controversy. Even a decade prior, no fewer than twenty-three countries had identified
sugar as a major contributor to chronic disease. TRS 916 called for limiting added
sugar to less than 10 percent of the total calories in the diet. Clearly, this could not
stand. Dr. Riaz Khan, director of the World Sugar Research Organization, countered,
“The concept of good food and bad food lacks scientific credibility…Every food can
make a valuable contribution to diet and diet variety; it is getting the balance right that
is the key.”
Time for the big guns. American food manufacturers’ groups began frantic lobbying
in Washington. The Sugar Association threatened to “exercise every avenue available
to expose the dubious nature” of the report. Its lobbying resulted in a scathing 2004
letter to WHO from William Steiger, special assistant at the Department of Health and
Human Services (and godson to George H. W. Bush), rejecting years of research and
denying any evidence of a link between junk food and obesity. Steiger’s letter
questioned the scientific basis for “the linking of fruit and vegetable consumption to
decreased risk of obesity and diabetes.” He added: “There is an unsubstantiated focus
on ‘good’ and ‘bad’ foods and a conclusion that specific foods are linked to non-
communicable diseases and obesity…the assertion that heavy marketing of energy-
dense foods or fast-food outlets increases the risk of obesity is supported by almost no
data.” Next, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson threatened to
withhold the $406 million annual U.S. contribution to WHO unless TRS 916 was
repealed. Suffice it to say, TRS 916 was deep-sixed, there is
still no DRI for sugar, no
sugar limit, and the world just keeps getting fatter and sicker.
Anything but a SNAP: The USDA versus Mayor Bloomberg
The disparities in metabolic syndrome between the rich and poor continue to vex
government at the federal and local level because they are the ones who ultimately have
to pay for it. Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City has been a public health
pioneer and out front on this issue from the outset. In 2011, Bloomberg petitioned the
SNAP program, sponsored by the USDA, to conduct a pilot project in New York City
to remove sugared beverages from its portfolio. He argued that SNAP would save $4
billion a year and that the government would save countless sums on Medicaid and
Medicare. Unfortunately, the USDA denied Bloomberg’s petition, saying there were no
outcome measures, no determination of what defined a sugared beverage, and no
preparation on the part of vendors.
The USDA was also concerned that SNAP recipients would be “stigmatized.”

Stigmatized? If you’re poor and using food stamps, you’re already stigmatized. If you’re
obese, you’re already stigmatized. How much more stigmatization could the USDA
argue? The goal of the SNAP program is “to provide improved levels of nutrition
among low-income households.” In fact, the American Beverage Association had
lobbied the USDA, accusing New York City of unfair discrimination to prevent food
stamps from being used to purchase sugary beverages.
The Legislative Branch: Protecting the Food Industry
The National School Lunch Program (NSLP)
More than thirty million children eat their lunch at school due to the NSLP, an
entitlement of the Farm Bill. Children who use this program have an increased
prevalence of obesity, even after race and poverty are factored in.

 The School Meals
Initiative of 1995 provides that school lunches must contain no more than 30 percent of
calories from fat and 25 percent of the
daily allowance of protein, calcium, iron,
vitamin A, vitamin C, and age-appropriate calories. Not one word about sugar (or
vitamin D, for that matter). And there’s the rub. In 2010, schools were required to limit
the levels of saturated fat, sodium, calories, and trans fats in meals. Still not one word
about sugar. And while “whole grains” are required, they are not defined (see
chapter

).
Everyone is a dietitian, even politicians. In 1983, President Reagan determined that
ketchup was a vegetable. More recently, in response to the “restrictive” guidelines
placed on school lunches, lobbyists representing pizza manufacturers and cheese
producers went to work. They obtained congressional concessions that one eighth of a
cup of tomato paste would have the nutritional equivalent of one eighth of a cup of
vegetables. In November 2011, Congress unapologetically got into the nutrition
business, declaring “pizza is now a vegetable.” Who knew?
The “Cheeseburger Bill”
In 2000, lawsuits lobbed against McDonald’s for causing obesity and heart disease
struck fear in the heart of Big Food. Its response was to lobby Congress to draft the
Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act, aka the “Cheeseburger Bill.”
Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.) exclaimed, “This bill says, ‘Don’t run off
and file a lawsuit if you are fat.’ It says, ‘Look in the mirror because you’re the one to
blame…If a person knows or should know that eating copious orders of super-sized
McDonald’s products is unhealthy and could result in weight gain, it is not the place of
the law to protect them from their own excesses.’” The bill has yet to get to the Oval
Office, but it has been passed by the House of Representatives. Instead, individual
states are bowing to the pressure, or the dollars. Minnesota state representative Dean
Urdahl (R-Grove City) said, “It’s about personal responsibility; it’s about jobs; it’s
about protecting our food industry. It’s also about helping our consumers not have to
pay increased costs because of liability.” Despite its passage in the state legislature, on
May 27, 2011, a similar bill in Minnesota was vetoed by Governor Mark Dayton. Other
states are maneuvering to pass their own versions.
Gag on This: Eat It and Shut Up
More insidiously, Representative Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), a physician himself, in
2012 introduced H.R. 3848, the “Protecting Foods and Beverages from Government
Attack Act of 2012,” which would prohibit the use of federal money for advertising
campaigns against anything on the FDA’s GRAS list. Agriculture gag rules have been
around for decades; this is how Oprah got into trouble for disparaging meat. But
Representative DesJarlais’ bill completely misses the point. As an example, if he has
his way and succeeds in making you say no to trans fats—despite all the science, it’s
still on the GRAS list—New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg might find himself
hauled into jail.
Whose Side Is Government On?
Our representatives couldn’t be more duplicitous when it comes to obesity and our
metabolic health. The executive and legislative branches are elected to generate
dollars. Public health spends dollars. And the black hole of obesity sucks in even more
dollars. Worse yet, not one diet and exercise intervention has been shown to save
dollars for government. The government may as well promote policies that will make
the food industry (and often themselves) more money. And that’s why it continues its
mantra of “personal responsibility.” No wonder our citizens don’t trust our government
to get us out of this mess. Except that public health efforts can’t and won’t occur
without some sort of effective societal intervention.
The Judicial Branch: No Horse in This Race
But hope is not completely lost. There’s one branch of government that has not yet been
co-opted: the judicial branch. The assumption is that the law is impartial—although the
legislators who make new laws might not be, witness the Cheeseburger Bill—and that
careful use of the law might extricate us from our current vicious cycle.

 In 2009, at a
major international public
health forum in India, the participants composed the
Hyderabad Statement, which includes the sentence “All significant public health
interventions involve and require the use of law.”
When other public health debacles have reached a “tipping point,” the law has
helped pave the way for reform by enforcing such community-protecting features as
sanitation, building standards, and pollution control.

 Whether it’s reducing
greenhouse gases or testing for HIV, the law has played a pivotal role in advancing the
public health agenda. For instance, the assault against smoking began with the lawsuit
brought by the Mississippi attorney general to recoup claims. Law is blind, but could
the law help us see our way out of this mess?
Prosecution for Deceptive Advertising
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is charged with regulating “unfair or deceptive”
business practices, including food advertising. “Unfair” practices are those that may
cause substantial, unavoidable injury (to consumers) that is not outweighed by offsetting
consumer or competitive benefits. Advertising is “deceptive” if it is likely to mislead
consumers into making decisions regarding a product. In 1972 the FTC exercised this
charge effectively by prosecuting Sugar Information, a public relations arm of the Sugar
Association, with unfair advertising practices, based on the type of ad seen here (
figure
21.1
), one of several that ran in newspapers nationwide. This ad suggests that you will
eat fewer calories at a meal if you consume sugar before the meal, a claim whose
veracity had not been examined, and that could be detrimental if followed. Sadly, the
food industry continues to find itself on the receiving end of “cease and desist” motions
—everything from a 1992 disputation that a Kraft Singles cheese slice contained
calcium equal to 5 ounces of milk to charges that advertising claims touting a breakfast
of Frosted Mini-Wheats was “clinically shown to improve kids’ attentiveness by nearly
20 percent” and removing the “boosts immunity” claim from Kellogg’s Cocoa Krispies
in 2009.
Unfortunately, the FTC was declawed in 1978 when it attempted to regulate junk
food advertising in the now-infamous KidVid scandal. Within the context of free
speech, the food industry vigorously lobbied Congress to prevent any regulation of
marketing to children, upon which Congress threatened to defund the FTC unless the
matter were dropped. On the subject of regulating the food industry, the FTC has never
been heard from again. The following is an excerpt from the FTC’s own record:
“Based on the history of FTC regulation of children’s advertising…and the current state
of the law with regard to commercial speech and the First Amendment, one can only
conclude that restricting untruthful advertising is not the way to address the health
concerns regarding obesity.”

Fig. 21.1. Don’t Believe Everything You Lick.
 A newspaper advertisement composed by Sugar Information,
Inc., which was struck down by the Federal Trade Commission in 1972 for unfair advertising practices. Sugar
Information, Inc., was the public information/education arm of the U.S. Sugar Association.
Other Ways the Law Can Fight Obesity
The law is a powerful tool because it demands facts—something that science can
supply. By nature, I’m not a litigious person, but lawsuits are a great way to get the
food industry and government’s attention, and maybe even to get them to do the “right
thing,” because the Court effectively muzzles the opposing lobbyists. Most legal action
in the field of public health has revolved around the question of “negligence” or
“failure to warn.” Can either the food industry or institutions that push problem food
onto vulnerable populations be held liable?
Various avenues for state-by-state change are being considered. For instance,
lawsuits in Washington State have been successful against school boards that accept
money from soft drink companies in exchange for exclusive vending rights. Other
possible lawsuits with public value include going against public education officials
who cut physical education from the school curriculum and against insurance health
plans for not covering medically necessary weight-loss treatments. What follows are
some more ideas that might have “legs” in the public health arena to help curb obesity:
Food Labeling
What about suing the FDA to revise the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990?
Although food labeling has minimal effect on purchases, it couldn’t hurt. The current
labeling scheme, around since 1990, hasn’t done anything to curb the obesity epidemic.
The currents labels do not convey the important facts that the public needs to make a
conscious health decision. Because what’s in the food isn’t important—all real foods
have inherent value. What the label should tell you is what’s been
added to
 or
subtracted from
 the food to make it more or less obesogenic. An example of such a
food label scheme is presented in
figure 21.2
.
Alternatively, the “traffic light” food-labeling scheme is a method for influencing
the nutritional quality of processed food through a simplification of the nutritional
attributes of a product. Red is for products that should be consumed in small amounts or
not at all (the Coca-Cola label is already red, so that should be easy), yellow for food
types that should be
consumed in moderation (for instance, whole grains), and green for
food that can be consumed anytime (vegetables, fruits). This method could be applied
to three nutritional areas of common concern to the public at large: fat, sugar, and salt.
The more green lights displayed, the healthier the product. The problem here is that the
food industry may attempt to alter the food specifically by quantitative tinkering with its
nutrient profile.
Fig. 21.2. The Lord Giveth, and Man Taketh Away.
 In addition to listing total nutrients, an alternative food label
might include added and subtracted nutrients, to tell the whole story. Here is a sample label (courtsey of Joey
Brunelle, Goose Rock Design):
a) Total calories are listed in plain language. No more “servings”—real units used instead (e.g., “this package” or “this
bar”).
b) Calories represented visually in a scale of a recommended snack or meal.
c) Major nutritional components listed in readable text.
d) “Sugar added,” “sodium added,” “fiber removed,” and “fiber added” suggest the degree of processing.
e) Recommended daily values are represented visually by filled circles: the colored circle’s area is proportional to the
daily value (the dashed circle).
f) The circles could be colored according to their dietary desirability. Added sugar, added salt, and omega-6 and trans
fats could be in red. Natural sugar and natural sodium could be in yellow. Fiber could be in green.
g) If there is none of an item, it is listed in plain language, as in “No Trans Fat” or “No Vitamin A.”
h) Color and size of the circle signal how healthy a particular food item is.
Take Dietary Control Away from the USDA
MyPlate, which replaced the USDA’s Food Pyramid, calls for 50 percent fruits and
vegetables, 25 percent whole grain carbohydrate, and 25 percent protein. A marked
improvement and, as an aside, almost identical to the “plate model” our clinic at UCSF
has used for the last nine years. But the USDA still forges nutrition policy, which is still
faulty.
In 2008, I stood for membership on the 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee (DGAC). I asked my friend and 2005 DGAC chairperson, Janet King, if she
was going to stand for membership again and she said, “Absolutely not. I’m tired and
frustrated.” She elaborated: “Our Committee submitted a 480-page document. Of those,
there were 80 pages on sugar and 80 pages on fiber. When the final document was
approved by the USDA, the document was 80 pages total, and the sections on both
sugar and fiber were gone.” “How can they do that? Didn’t you have any recourse?” I
asked. “We’re an advisory committee,” she said. “We have no teeth.”
The question is, why is the USDA in charge of the country’s nutrition anyway? In
2003 the
Chicago Tribune
 reported the comments of Senator Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.)

:
“The primary mission of the USDA is, after all, to promote the sale of agricultural
products…So putting the USDA in charge of dietary advice is in some respects like
putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.” So who should be in charge of our nutrition?
How about
anyone
 without a vested interest in pushing the poison?
Sue the FDA to Remove Fructose from the GRAS List
Ultimately, food producers and distributors must reduce the amount of sugar added to
foods. But sugar is cheap, tastes good, and sells,
so companies have little incentive to
change. The FDA could “set the table” for change by removing fructose from the GRAS
list. Opponents will argue that other nutrients on the GRAS list, such as iron and
vitamins A and D, can also be toxic when overconsumed. However, unlike sugar, these
substances have no abuse potential. Sugar’s removal from the GRAS list would send a
powerful signal to the European Food Safety Authority and the rest of the world, and
would force the food industry to rethink its recipes.
While, according to FDA regulations, the GRAS status of a substance must be
reconsidered as new scientific information emerges, the agency has not systematically
reconsidered GRAS substances since the 1980s.

 For instance, despite overwhelming
evidence, the FDA has largely not responded to concerns about trans fats, despite
eleven citizen petitions submitted to the agency between 2004 and 2008. There is more
than enough evidence to bring sugar to a new review by the FDA. Can the FDA rethink
sugar as not GRAS? It can, but it won’t without a lot of pressure—the kind that comes
from a lawsuit. Its own rules keep it from acting. The following comes from the tobacco
industry documents, written by an executive for Philip Morris, about the limits in
challenging the poisonous nature of food:
A food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any
poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to
health…[such that] food products does not result in acute injuries such
as poisoning, and with preventing consumers from being misled,
but not
with the prevention of chronic diseases even though its own
regulations explicitly postulate the connection between such products
and such diseases
. (italics mine)
In other words, the FDA is concerned only with
acute
 toxins in food (those
chemicals that kill you immediately), not
chronic
 toxins, which kill you slowly by
promoting chronic disease. Fructose is a chronic dose-dependent toxin, so, unless the
FDA is forced, don’t expect it to initiate any changes on its own. Petitions don’t work.
Lawsuits do.
Trusting Government, and Ourselves
None of the suggestions in this chapter is remotely actionable today, because
government has been co-opted in what is known as “elite capture.” By this we mean
that the government bends the regulatory systems in the food industry’s favor, to
maintain a decidedly lopsided power structure. Either the legislative branch won’t act
because the food industry is paying it off, the executive branch won’t act because it’s
afraid of the political repercussions, or the populace won’t act because as far as they
are concerned, “a calorie is still a calorie” and they still believe in personal
responsibility—and they’re addicted anyway. Our current distrust of government is
well placed. It’s in our DNA. Thomas Jefferson said, “That government is best which
governs the least, because its people discipline themselves.” Yet there is no discipline.
That’s the curse of addiction.
So we’re now faced with a highly unpleasant lesser of two evils. The question is
not whether you have any control over your food. You don’t. The question is, who do
you want to abdicate to? Whom do you want in your kitchen? The government, which
will co-opt your rights and your wallet, or the food industry, which has already co-
opted your rights, your wallet, and your health? I guess we all have to get really sick
first and have no other options. The bottom has to fall out. And then it’s time for
societal rehab. We’re just about there.
Chapter 22
A Call for Global Sugar Reduction
“This unprecedented meeting—the first ministerial conference on non-
communicable diseases—is evidence of a new and positive trend: the
world is paying attention to non-communicable diseases as never
before…Chronic illnesses influenced by diet, tobacco consumption and
other individual behaviors were long thought to be diseases of
affluence. That is clearly not the case. The World Health Organization
estimates that nearly 9 out of 10 people who die from non-
communicable diseases under the age of 60 live in the developing
world. They have less protection from the risks and consequences of
these diseases than people in the developed world.”
—U.N. secretary-general Ban-Ki Moon, to the First Global Ministerial
Conference on Healthy Lifestyles and Noncommunicable Disease
Control, Moscow, April 28, 2011
It Tolls for Thee…
On September 20, 2011, in New York, the UN secretary-general lowered the boom.
The world is dying. Not of the plague, not of influenza, not of Ebola, not of AIDS.
Noncommunicable disease (i.e., heart disease, diabetes, cancer, dementia—in other
words, the metabolic syndrome) is now a greater threat to the developed
and
developing world than is infectious disease. This is quite a paradigm shift. The reality
is that every country that has adopted the Western diet (now the industrial global diet)
has witnessed rising rates of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, economic
development means that the populations of low- and middle-income
countries are living
longer (which is a good thing), but are therefore more susceptible to these diseases
(which is a bad thing). Currently, there are 30 percent more obese than undernourished
people on the planet. And 80 percent of deaths from heart disease and other
noncommunicable diseases occur in low- and middle-income countries.

The Rationale for Targeting Sugar
The UN announcement targets tobacco, alcohol, and diet as the central risk factors in
noncommunicable disease. The first two, tobacco and alcohol, by everyone’s
estimation, are the most prevalent and dangerous chronic exposures on the planet. Both
are regulated by governments around the world to protect the public health—not just for
the abuser, but for the innocent bystander as well. Alcohol has a long history of
governmental control, extending back to ancient China, when an attempt was made to
curb alcohol’s promotion of unruly behavior and property damage. More recently, the
efforts of MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) and other advocacy groups have
promoted efforts to curtail drunk driving, more to protect the innocent bystander than
the drinker himself. Public outcry works. Tobacco is more recently regulated, not just
because of lung cancer, but also to curtail the dangers of secondhand smoke. But what,
if anything, about diet should be targeted? And why? This is a little more complicated.
Unlike with tobacco and alcohol, we
need
 food. What aspect of the Western diet should
be targeted for intervention?
Denmark took the first plunge, despite the fact that obesity isn’t a huge problem
there. The Danes first chose to tax foods high in saturated fat, even though most medical
professionals no longer believe that fat is the primary culprit (see
chapter 10
). After
all, look where such a belief has gotten us. But now Denmark is ready to tax sugar as
well, which, as you will see, is a much more plausible and defensible step.
Do we really need to restrict sugar? After all, sugar is fun. Sugar is family. Sugar is
pleasure. Coke’s 2009 tag line is “Open Happiness.” Now, that’s going a bit too far.
Maybe pleasure, on a good day. But there’s nothing “happy” about sugar, and this book
documents the unhappiness that sugar has wrought worldwide.
In 2003 a landmark book called
Alcohol: No Ordinary Commodity

 laid out the
four criteria that the public health community established to justify the regulation of a
substance: unavoidability, toxicity, abuse, and costs to society. Alcohol and tobacco
easily meet these criteria. But what about sugar? My colleagues Laura Schmidt, Claire
Brindis, and I evaluated these effects.

Unavoidability
Sugar is now the most ubiquitous foodstuff worldwide, and has been added to virtually
every processed food, limiting consumer choice and the ability to avoid it.
Approximately 80 percent of the 600,000 consumer packaged foods in the United States
have added caloric sweeteners. The only way you can avoid it is if you grow your own.
Many schools have removed soda from their vending machines but they still serve juice
and chocolate milk. When you were five, would you opt for water over chocolate milk?
And in 40 percent of schools in California there are no drinking water fountains, so
again, your children don’t get to choose, and can’t avoid the sugar.

 Daily sugar intake
in many countries now tops 400 calories (see
chapter 11
).
Toxicity
If “a calorie is a calorie” were true, and obesity and metabolic syndrome were a result
of “empty calories,” the mantra of “eat less, exercise more” would stand. But sugar is
not “empty calories.” The fructose component is a toxin by itself—a chronic one, a
dose-dependent one—but a toxin nonetheless.

 We know about the ill effects of
smoking and prolonged alcohol usage. Every single disease or condition of metabolic
syndrome is driven by fructose, including hypertension, through increases in uric acid;
high triglycerides and insulin resistance, through synthesis of fat in the liver; diabetes,
via increased liver glucose production combined with insulin resistance; accelerated
aging, due to damage to lipids and protein; likely cancer, due to DNA damage, high
insulin levels, and the fact that some cancers seem to use fructose preferentially for
energy; and likely dementia, through insulin resistance in the brain.
Abuse
Sugar acts on the reward center

 to encourage subsequent intake (see
chapters 5
 and

). Whether it fits the criterion for addiction is irrelevant; the stuff is abused. You get
hooked at an early age, and it’s harder to kick the habit after years of prolonged usage.
There are now numerous human studies examining the dependence-producing
properties of sugar.

 By reducing dopamine signaling in the brain’s reward center, the
pleasure derived from food is reduced (increasing tolerance), compelling the
individual to consume more. And when the sugar is stopped, symptoms of irritability
(withdrawal) become apparent.
Costs to Society
Society acknowledges that alcohol abuse (driving under the influence) and smoking
(effects of secondhand smoke) can injure the innocent bystander. But how does your
sugar consumption affect me? An extra $274 million in jet fuel to cart the obese around
the skies? Discomfort on the subway? Sinking of boats due to the weight? In 2003 the
Ethan Allen,
 a tour boat, capsized in Lake George, New York, because it was certified
to carry 48 people at 140 pounds, yet the average person aboard was 25 percent over
that weight. The diseases of metabolic syndrome are bankrupting the medical care
systems of our country and the world at large.

 In the United States, we’re talking $150
billion annually in health care expenditures and $73 billion in lost productivity due to
obesity in full-time employees.

 This amount is expected to increase to $192 billion by
2030. And because 27 percent of military applicants are now rejected for obesity-
related reasons, the past three U.S. surgeons general and the chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff have declared obesity a “threat to national security.”
Why Alcohol Is So Relevant
The appropriate analogy to draw for sugar is with alcohol (see
chapter 11
). Let’s
recap.
1.   Alcohol is derived from the fermentation of sugar.
2.   Both are metabolized by the liver, bypassing insulin regulation to overload the
mitochondria and cause metabolic abnormalities.
3.   Both act as an energy source, but with a clear health cost.
4.   Both are legal substances that produce harm when overused.
5.   Both cause the diseases of metabolic syndrome.
6.   Both are addictive, acting at the reward center of the brain, with bingeing,
craving, tolerance, and withdrawal.
7.   Both bring with it a stigma from overuse.
8.   Both are abused by the lowest socioeconomic strata, almost certainly to
stimulate pleasure, and the overwhelming burden of harm falls on them.
9.   Both are treated as market commodities.
10.   Both have generated powerful industry lobbies and vested interests, and have
co-opted the objectivity of many government officials.
Unfortunately, moderating your sugar intake is nearly impossible given our current
sugar glut. Sugar is in nearly everything you eat or drink, and you’re hooked on it from
childhood. Given all the metabolic, hedonic, and societal similarities to alcohol,
doesn’t it make sense to use the lessons learned from alcohol control policies and apply
them as a template for societal approaches to sugar reduction?
Does Education Change “Behavior” for Addictive
Substances?
There’s no question that public health campaigns can help change attitudes, which can
help change disease risk. For instance, education increased condom use to reduce HIV
rates. But for alcohol, tobacco, and street drugs, most of the popular approaches to
public health education don’t work to curtail abuse for two reasons: because they do
not do anything to reduce availability of the substance in question, and because those
substances are addictive. For instance, school-based education programs have little
effect on reducing alcohol consumption.

 School-based obesity education
programs to
date also show limited success,

 in part because our kids’ food preferences are formed
before they ever get to school and because their home environment remains constant.
Teaching the child won’t fix her environment.
Necessary, but not sufficient.
 Ask the
kid who returns from fat camp and gains all his weight back within three months.
What about public service announcements (PSAs) or counter-advertising? The
recent anti-tobacco ads with amputees and tracheostomy patients are pretty stark, but
they don’t change tobacco availability. Thus far, alcohol PSAs have demonstrated only
modest effects with respect to total alcohol consumption.

 Despite numerous ad
campaigns to combat obesity, such as those in New York City,

 there are no data that
show that PSAs
alone
 are effective in reducing sugar consumption.
Necessary, but not
sufficient.
How about the latest hot idea, menu labeling? New York City was the first to
require in-store labeling for consumer education. The results show that, for adults,
average calorie consumption did not change with the advent of labeling changes alone
—828 versus 846 calories—only 15 percent of adults altered their choices based on
caloric knowledge.

 One study compared a New York City sample population exposed
to labeling with a Newark, New Jersey, sample population exposed to no labeling.

Guess what? No difference! Worse yet, none of the current menu-labeling initiatives
even measure sugar—it’s just total calories, fat, and salt.
Necessary, but not sufficient.
This goes for food labeling as well. Remember “Smart Choices,” the green
checkmark that the food industry placed on products to indicate compliance with USDA
food standards? Cocoa Krispies and Froot Loops bore the Smart Choice insignia. Froot
Loops qualified because it met standards for fiber and vitamins A and C; and because it
did not exceed limits on fat, sodium, and sugar (only 12 grams per serving—or

percent of the product
, that’s all). The program was scrapped in 2009 due to the outcry
of citizens incredulous that Froot Loops was on the list. The Environmental Working
Group in 2011 published Sugar in Children’s Cereals,

 which documented the sugar
content of eighty-four breakfast cereals (and while they were at it, the lack of fiber).
Table 22.1
 shows the worst.
Incredibly, Froot Loops is only number ten! Perhaps the
biggest travesty is that this information is not squarely placed on the label for all to see.
Table 22.1: The Ten Worst Children’s Breakfast Cereals (from among 275)
1. Kellogg’s Honey Smacks: 55.6 percent sugar by weight
Ingredients: Sugar, wheat, dextrose, honey, contains 2 percent or less of vegetable oil (hydrogenated or partially
hydrogenated soybean), salt, caramel color, soy lecithin, BHT for freshness.
2. Post Golden Crisp: 51.9 percent sugar
3. Kellogg’s Froot Loops Marshmallow: 48.3 percent sugar
4. Quaker Oats Cap’n Crunch’s OOPS! All Berries: 46.9 percent sugar
5. Quaker Oats Cap’n Crunch Original: 44.4 percent sugar
6. Quaker Oats Oh!s: 44.4 percent sugar
7. Kellogg’s Smorz: 43.3 percent sugar
8. Kellogg’s Apple Jacks: 42.9 percent sugar
9. Quaker Oats Cap’n Crunch’s Crunch Berries: 42.3 percent sugar
10. Kellogg’s Froot Loops Original: 41.4 percent sugar
Then there are government guidelines. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee suggested an upper limit of 25 percent of daily calories allotted to added
sugar (remember, Nutrition Facts gives you only total sugar, not added sugar).
However, a recent adult study showed that when 25 percent of calories were due to
added sugar, people developed worsened LDL, triglycerides, and insulin resistance
within two weeks.

Bottom line, although lots of effort and money have been thrown at various methods
of obesity prevention at the individual education level, the results are downright
disappointing.

 When it comes right down to it, you can’t change behavior with
information alone, especially when you’re talking about addictive substances.
Necessary, but not sufficient.
 Because the biochemical drive will eventually overcome
any cognitive attempt to control it. Nope, it’s going to be all about changing the
environment, and that means changing availability.
Changing Marketing to Children: Not Much Better
There is plenty of evidence that the cumulative effect of alcohol advertising alters
young people’s perceptions, and encourages pro-alcohol attitudes and greater
consumption.

 While population studies find some small effects for alcohol advertising
bans, individual studies of short-term impacts on alcohol consumption find no effect.

Worse yet, industry-sponsored efforts are even less efficacious for the public health
—“Don’t drink and drive,” by Budweiser, has become “Drink Budweiser and then let
someone else drive.” Government-imposed regulations on the marketing and promotion
of alcohol products have mainly targeted youth, with varied results.
Although commercials for alcohol (except for beer and wine) have been scaled
back since the 1970s, messages about alcohol still pervade the airwaves. Government-
imposed regulations on marketing of alcohol to youth have been somewhat effective.
The success of regulations that limit how alcohol is advertised and marketed has
immediate relevance for sugar reduction.
Can we limit junk food advertising, especially those marketing sugar? Marketing to
children is a major goal of the food industry, as it hastens “branding” of specific
products, which the child will likely take into adulthood. All this despite the fact that
children can’t tell the TV show from the commercial until they are eight years old. A
2007 study showed that the average American child sees thirty thousand TV
commercials annually marketing fast food or candy.

 An average of one food
commercial is shown every five minutes during Saturday morning cartoons. Advertisers
spent more than $10 billion targeting children and youth though TV ads, coupons,
contests, public relations promotions, and packaging designed for children. All this
advertising translates into purchasing requests

 and, more important to the industry,
increased consumption.

In 2007 the health ministers of fifty-two European nations convened in Istanbul and
agreed to ban the marketing of junk food to children.

 Heartened by this effort, in
October 2007, I asked Deborah Taylor Tate, then commissioner of the Federal
Communications Commission under President George W. Bush, whether this was
feasible in America. Her response was “I expect the food industry to police itself.”
When left to
their own devices, cigarette ads blatantly targeted children until public
outcry demanded that the government step in. Metabolic syndrome is currently claiming
more lives than lung cancer. Clearly public outcry has to become so deafening that the
government has no recourse but to take action. Against all odds, and led by Dr. Guido
Gerardi Lavin, a pediatrician and former president of the Senate, the nation of Chile in
May 2012 became the first nation to ban junk food marketing to children.
In 2007 the Better Business Bureau produced a voluntary industry agreement called
the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI), which ostensibly
limits advertising and promotion to children in schools, and is set to go into effect in
2014. The standards would apply equally to all companies that participate (currently
seventeen), but participation is voluntary. For instance, Nestlé, the world largest food
conglomerate, has thus far said, “Go fly.” Here’s an example of what’s okay to market
under this initiative: Pepperidge Farm Goldfish, Kellogg’s Apple Jacks, and
ConAgra’s Chef Boy-ar-dee canned pastas. Not entirely happy with this response, in
2011 Congress directed the FTC, the FDA, the CDC, and the USDA to establish an
Interagency Working Group (IWG) of federal nutrition, health, and marketing experts.
The IWG came up with stricter, but still voluntary, guidelines that would limit not only
television but also other forms of multimedia advertising (e.g., websites, online games,
social media movies). The food industry lobbied Congress so hard that the IWG has
withdrawn, and is planning to support the weaker, self-anointed CFBAI. So will
Toucan Sam and Tony the Tiger bite the dust? Don’t bet on it.

Thus far, there are no government-imposed bans on the marketing of high-sugar-
content products to children in the United States. Even so, despite vigorous lobbying by
the food industry, San Francisco recently instituted a ban on including toys with fast
food meals. Why does a toddler need more coercion to eat fast food than the food
itself? Since then, the political fallout has resulted in three states banning “toy bans.”
Nonetheless, in June 2012 Disney got the memo—they will cease marketing of junk
food to children under twelve. Hope springs eternal.
Changing the Environment
What will it really take to reduce sugar consumption? We can’t get rid of it; rather, like
alcohol and tobacco, we will have to learn to “peacefully co-exist” with these
substances. Let’s look to the many generations of international experience with alcohol
control to find models that do work. Anything that works does so by limiting
availability.

 This means upstream strategies that limit supply, rather than downstream
approaches that hope to decrease demand, but can’t. Reducing availability can be done
at three levels: taxation, restriction, and interdiction. Well, forget interdiction—that’s a
non-starter. It didn’t work for alcohol. Criminalizing a substance as widespread or as
popular as sugar would be equally doomed to failure; can you imagine sugar
prohibition, with candy speak-easys and bathtubs of Coca-Cola? But successful
interventions all share a common end point: curbing availability. In other words,
control the environment, not behavior.
Some municipalities have taken up the gauntlet. For instance, in California we have
State Bill 19, or “Sodas out of Schools.” In 2008, former president Bill Clinton and
former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee reached an agreement with the beverage
industry to get sodas out of schools—but they didn’t negotiate the elimination of the
juice and the sports drinks. In 2012 a study showed that in the twelve states where soda
had been removed from schools, sugared beverage consumption by teens remained just
as high as it had ever been.

Taxation
Taxation is a simple and effective, if unpopular, way of reducing consumption of
virtually anything. Taxation follows the law of supply and demand: adding a tax
increases the price of the substance of concern such that consumers can afford to buy
less of it. Alcohol taxes are popular worldwide because they are relatively cheap and
easy to collect, while causing little market distortion. Alcohol taxation, in the form of
special excise duties (taxing the producer), or value added and sales taxes (taxing the
consumer), has proven
among the most prodigious and effective ways worldwide to
reduce the overall volume of drinking and, in turn, alcohol-attributable harm.

Could taxing sugar help solve obesity?

 This is one of the most incendiary topics
on the agenda. Want to stop a dialogue in the United States? Utter the phrase “soda tax.”
Soda is not all sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)—SSBs are only 33 percent of all
added sugar—and SSBs are not the sole cause of the obesity epidemic, so this strategy
is incomplete at best.

 Nonetheless, SSBs have several characteristics that make them
the most promising target for prevention of obesity and metabolic syndrome

 (see
chapter 9
). First, SSBs are a clearly defined category, unlike other “junk foods” that
might contain some protein, fiber, or micronutrients. There is
nothing
 in an SSB that’s
valuable. Oh, some will argue that juice has vitamin C. But the fiber was the good part
of the fruit, and vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) is now so rare that cases of it are
reported in medical journals.

 Second, SSBs contribute more calories to the diet than
any other single type of food or beverage. Third, the evidence supporting an association
between SSB intake and obesity is stronger than for any other single foodstuff.
State-sponsored soft drink excise taxes reduced soft drink sales and consumption
among children and adolescents, while consumption of whole milk increased. (One
downside is that consumption of fruit juice also increased.)

 Another intervention in a
hospital cafeteria showed that increasing the price of a soda by 35 percent resulted in a
26 percent reduction in consumption.

 Thus, soda taxation represents a viable public
health strategy.

 Already, Canada imposes a GST (goods and services tax), and some
European countries impose a VAT (value added tax) on some sweetened foods.
In the United States, the concept of a soda tax has met with a firestorm of
antagonism, from everyone from the libertarians claiming consumer freedom, to the
ACLU claiming discrimination based on poverty, to the food industry claiming
“scientific McCarthyism.” The beverage industry has spent millions of dollars on
lobbying against an SSB “sin tax.” It is so desperate to derail this legislation that it
offered the city of Philadelphia $10 million, including an obesity professorship at
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, if the city agreed to abandon its proposed excise
tax on soda. While this offer might seem generous, Philadelphia would have raised $77
million
in revenues in one year, with $20 million going toward obesity prevention, if
the tax had gone through. Money talks, science walks.
A Bad Rap?
Soda taxation has gotten a bad rap for three major reasons. First, how can the poor
finance a soda tax? “Regressive” taxes place a greater burden of cost on lower-income
consumers.

 The U.S. has a strong tradition of consumer rights protection; taxes that
exert unfair constraints on individual choice are bad enough, and those levied on the
poor are doomed to fail. Which begs the question—can a “regressive” tax be in the
public health interest? Hey, it works for tobacco and alcohol. Of course it can, but with
three caveats. First, regressive taxes makes sense only if the substance being taxed
causes disproportionate health harms in the poor. This is certainly true for all addictive
substances, including tobacco, alcohol and sugar. Remember, fructose is not an
essential nutrient, the burden of metabolic syndrome is highest in lower-income
minorities,

 and the current loss of productivity and added medical costs associated
with metabolic syndrome provide a strong case for widespread taxpayer benefits.
Second, the proceeds of the tax must be diverted back to the public health of the
lower-income population, to balance out the regressive nature of the tax. In the case of
sugar, tax revenues could be applied toward subsidies on fresh produce. They could
also be used to finance commercial loan and development programs encouraging
grocery stores and farmers’ markets to relocate to underserved low-income
communities or food deserts. By redirecting subsidies to make healthful products
accessible to low-income consumers, valid concerns about regressive taxation and
government paternalism can be headed off at the pass. Everyone wins (except the
beverage industry).
Third, what is the purpose of the tax? To prevent obesity or to pay for obesity
programs? The fear is that the politicians will abscond with the money as a quick fix to
close their budget shortfalls and avoid cuts to critical services such as public safety and
transportation. The American Beverage Association says that despite the rhetoric of
elected officials wanting to curb obesity, soda taxes are all about filling up public
coffers. Larry Young,
CEO of Dr. Pepper Snapple and chairman of the ABA, told
Goldman Sachs, “You say it’s for obesity. Come on, it’s to fill a budget deficit.” And
there’s real reason to be worried about this. The current proposal is for a penny-per-
ounce soda tax, which would raise the price of a can of soda by $0.12. While this
would generate approximately $13 billion in revenue,

 it is unlikely to have a
significant impact on reducing SSB consumption and the diseases associated with
metabolic syndrome. Rather, statistical modeling suggests that the price would have to
double to reduce soda consumption—so a one-dollar can of soda should cost two
dollars.

 And no one is ready for that…yet. But give it time. No one in New York was
ready to spend $11.90 for a pack of cigarettes either. Hefty taxes are required to reduce
consumption of addictive substances.
Restriction of Access
Throughout this book, I’ve hammered one issue time and again:
control the
environment
. Nothing reduces sugar consumption better than reducing sugar
availability. And that means restricting access. Especially to children. We’ve been
largely successful with alcohol. Why not sugar?
Successful alcohol control strategies restrict accessibility to purchase, such as
reducing the hours retailers are open, controlling the location and density of retail
markets, and limiting who can legally purchase alcohol.

 A reasonable parallel for
sugar would be tighten licensing requirements on vending machines and snack bars that
sell sugary products in schools and workplaces. Many schools have removed soda from
vending machines, but usually replace them with juice and sports drinks, which are no
better.
Reduction in the number and density of convenience stores that sell alcohol clearly
cuts down on consumption, especially in poor neighborhoods.

 Similarly, states could
apply zoning ordinances to control the number of fast food outlets and convenience
stores in low-income communities, and especially around schools, while providing
incentives for the establishment of grocery stores and farmers’ markets. They could
also apply zoning ordinances to inconvenience the food trucks that are multiplying like
flies outside schools during lunchtime and after the bell rings,
targeting our children.
Another option would be to limit sales in stores during times of school operation, so
kids couldn’t buy a soda on the way home. One would expect that kids who walk to
school would have lower BMIs because they exercise. Wrong. My colleague Kristine
Madsen showed that kids who walk to school have higher BMIs because they’re
stopping to buy soda and chips!

Lastly, how about an age limit (such as seventeen) in order to purchase drinks with
added sugar? Yes, card kids for Coke! You got a problem with that? Store managers
already do it for alcohol, and it would cost nothing to implement. If parents want their
kids to have a soda, they can buy it for them. Recently, parents in South Philadelphia
took this upon themselves. They formed a posse by lining up outside convenience stores
and blocking children from entering these stores after school.

 Why couldn’t a public
health directive do the same?
Not one to be stymied by the USDA over the 2011 Food Stamp debacle, in June
2012 Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled a bold proposal to eliminate Big Gulps from
New York City, a move well within his purview. Will this edict really reduce sugar
consumption? What’s to prevent people from buying two sodas instead of one? I recall
a Bill DeOre cartoon from the
Dallas Morning News
, showing a kid at a fast food
counter. Before downsizing, he orders a large order of fries. After, he orders sixteen
orders of fries. Libertarians have gone ballistic decrying Bloomberg’s usurping of
personal freedom. Environmentalists are angry as this may mean more plastic waste.
Politicians argue this will be unwieldy to administer. But if Bloomberg did nothing
else, he sent a loud and clear message: public health is a noble cause, and one worth
fighting for.
Curb the Subsidies? Or Curb the Deregulation?
In order to balance the U.S. budget, the Farm Bill needs to lose $23 billion from its
ledger. Crop subsidies account for $6 billion per year; of that, $3.5 billion goes to
corn, and $1.6 billion goes to soybeans. Diverting money away from subsidies is not
without its dangers, especially now that we live in a global economy. One product of
our corn subsidy is the production of
ethanol as an additive for gasoline, but
environmentalists have railed against this practice for years, as it puts more carbon
emissions into the atmosphere.
There are two types of subsidies: payments to farmers only when the price of the
crop is low (to keep them from going out of business), and payments to farmers based
on performance, regardless of price. Over the five years from 2006 through 2011, the
price of corn has never been higher

 yet the corn subsidy continues unabated.
Propping up consumption of specific foodstuffs with price subsidies is a great way
to cause market distortion. If supply and demand work their magic, then stopping a
subsidy should raise prices, and our food should get more expensive. Is that good or
bad? Advocates for the poor would lobby immediately. So would Iowa. But the
government and the poor would ultimately save on the subsidy, in medical costs and
improved worker productivity. One problem with removing these subsides is that they
are unlikely to make a significant difference in the price of junk food. Furthermore, as
the poor frequently have limited access to healthy alternatives, they will have to buy
junk food even if the price goes up marginally. Taxation proponents favor an excise tax
concept because it passes the cost on to industry, which can well afford it. The question
is whether it would alter industry’s practices.
A different line of reasoning suggests that it’s not the subsidies that overproduce
commodity crops, and overproduction is not the cause of obesity. Unlike with other
industries, agricultural producers do not respond to price signals by reducing the
amount of a crop when prices are low.

 Producers may reduce hired labor, but not
production. In an agricultural policy dating back to President Roosevelt’s New Deal,
the USDA paid farmers not to grow certain crops to prevent overproduction. To keep
farms from going out of business, Congress recently approved an annual $20 billion
payment to farmers as a direct subsidy, despite the increase in price of all commodities
from 2006 through 2011. And no Midwest state will put the brakes on this gravy train.
If the United States completely eliminated all commodity protection and subsidy
policies, very few foods would change in price. But the one food that would be affected
would be sugar, with a reduction in production of 33 percent (because of the
elimination
of the corn subsidy) and a reduction in price of 15 percent (because of the
end of the sugar tariffs).

 The point is that even though we pay more for sugar because
of the sugar tariffs, we still consume more, because of sugar’s abuse potential. Again,
standard economic principles do not apply to addictive substances.
There’s only one answer that the farmers, the food industry, and the populace can
live with: differential subsidization. Instead of subsidizing corn and soy (commodity
crops that are storable), why can’t we subsidize something green? We have the
technology to do this. When broccoli and carrots are cheaper than potato chips, then
Michael Pollan’s thesis on the price of a calorie can be turned around for everyone’s
benefit. Promotion of high-fiber foods in U.S. low-income programs such as WIC,
SNAP, and NSLP would be the obvious place to start. Furthermore, growing green
food means growing local. It would also make tariffs on imported goods a less
important concern, because they wouldn’t be subsidizing “commodities.” They would
be subsidizing real food.
Differential subsidization goes for water as well. In the developing world,
inhabitants have three choices—drink the dangerous water, buy an in-home chlorination
system, or buy “safe” sugared beverages made locally by Coke or Pepsi. If the water
chlorination system is provided for free, usage is at 80 percent. If people have to buy it,
they drink the sugared beverages instead, which costs more in the long term, both in
money and in medical costs.

 Until potable water is free, the developing world will
continue to suffer at the hands of the food industry as well.
Like a Phoenix out of the Ashes…
Any of these interventions would of necessity require a new business model—one that
supports real food over processed food. After all, we need the food industry; we just
don’t need their current fare. Because high-fiber foods have a limited shelf life, such
interventions would have to support local food production and reduced use of
antibiotics and pesticides, which would have implications for mitigating global
warming and environmental pollution. These interventions would require allocating
new farmland
around the country that could be adapted to grow real food, with minimal
technological prowess. However, this would of necessity require new delivery and
distribution systems, and new pricing strategies. It would also require changes in
marketing, especially to children. As distasteful as it is, such upstream societal
interventions can be accomplished only with governmental support. (There’s just no
way around it.)
Reducing sugar consumption will not be easy—particularly in the emerging markets
of developing countries, where soft drinks are cheaper than milk or potable water.
Societal intervention is needed to reduce the supply and eventual demand for sugar.
Despite the obvious medical, social, and economic benefits, we face an uphill political
battle against a powerful sugar and food processing lobby, and against those in
government who are already corrupted. Any change will require active engagement
from all stakeholders. And that means you. Especially you. With enough public clamor,
tectonic shifts in policy do become possible. Take, for instance, bans on smoking in
public, the use of designated drivers, airbags in cars, and condom dispensers in public
bathrooms. All unfathomable thirty years ago. Your voice changed the world. It can be
a new world…yet again.

Epilogue: Not a Top-Down,
but a Bottom-Up Movement
“Politics is the entertainment branch of industry.”
—Frank Zappa
n the preceding chapters, I have attempted to link the science of the obesity pandemic
to existing policy. In the process, I hope I have provided a new thought process and a
new direction, by looking backward. What is clear is that the few are profiting by
playing the politics of obesity to their advantage, at the expense of the many. We’ve
seen this movie before. We saw it with tobacco. The science was subverted for years
before the tobacco documents laid bare the corruption of the industry. Not only did the
industry consistently hide its findings, but as my UCSF colleagues Marcia Wertz and
Stanton Glantz found, the industry’s malfeasance even encompassed fabricating and
doctoring data,

 which, in the scientific world, is the greatest of crimes. Time for the
trial.
How does a district attorney ascribe culpability? There are three components to
successful prosecution. The first is association, the second is motive, and the slam-dunk
is the smoking gun. Recall the fight with Big Tobacco. The association between
smoking and lung cancer dates to 1964, with the first surgeon general’s report. The
motive became clear in the 1980s, when research documented the action of nicotine on
the brain’s addiction center. But it wasn’t until a whistleblower pointed the way to the
now-famous smoking gun documents that Big Tobacco’s callous disregard for its own
customers was exposed.
Does this analogy work for Big Food? The association of our
food environment
with obesity and metabolic syndrome is incontrovertible. We even have causation.
Motive is also a no-brainer. The American food industry produces 3,900 calories per
person per day, with about 29 percent wastage, but we should rationally eat 1,800–
2,000. Who eats the difference? We do! Throughout evolution, humans could eat only a
fixed amount, but today that amount is limitless. Because, as this book has shown, the
high-sugar, low-fiber industrial global diet actually makes us hungrier! What about the
smoking gun? Big Food
is
 Big Tobacco (Philip Morris = Altria = Kraft, General
Foods, Jell-O, and Post; RJR = Nabisco). Does the food industry know what it’s doing?
Does it know it has hijacked our evolutionary biochemistry, for its benefit and to our
detriment? We’ll probably never find the smoking gun for obesity, as the industry has
learned its lesson about leaving stray documents around. But we’ve already lost one
generation of kids. It’s time to hold Big Food’s feet to the fire, to compel it to undo
what it has done to our diet in the name of “progress” and “profit.” Given what it (and
we) know now, if it doesn’t change, that will be the smoking gun.
But there will be no prosecutions. Big Tobacco was convicted by a federal judge of
RICO racketeering, and tobacco executives lost their jobs for lying to Congress. They
were investigated for perjury, but none went to jail, nor were any forced to pay
penalties. Huge civil settlements generated windfalls for state governments, but nothing
for you. Still not convinced? Let’s take another example, the economic collapse of
2008. The corporate CEOs were guilty as hell, but not one went to jail. The government
financed $777 billion for corporate bailouts, but none for you. Likewise, there’s no
chance that any food company executive will ever be held liable. Hell, what they’re
doing is legal!
Worse yet, the executive and legislative branches of our government are clearly
lined up behind the food industry. The Farm Bill subsidizes the commodity crops that
are killing us, and the USDA continues to promote the U.S. food industry both here and
abroad. And the judicial branch hasn’t acted yet, in part because the public hasn’t
mobilized, as they still believe “
a calorie remains a calorie
”—for now.
No, my friends, this won’t be solved from the top-down. This will have to be a
bottom-up movement. You can’t expect government to do the
right thing. You have to
coerce it into doing the right thing. When there are more votes at stake than dollars,
that’s when legislators will come around. But that’s not a reason to be daunted. In a
democracy, the public has power. A good example is seat belts. Today you’d never
consider getting behind the wheel without fastening your seat belt, but this notion is
relatively new. Although the U.S. federal mandate to fit cars with seat belts was passed
in 1968, there was no federal mandate to use them. The first mandatory seat belt law
was enacted in Australia in 1970. Did Australia know that wearing seat belts would
save lives? No. It hadn’t been done before. It just seemed like a good public health
measure. The Big Three fought seat belt laws for years, and U.S. passengers continued
to die. It wasn’t until Mothers Against Drunk Driving made such a stink in every
statehouse that mandatory seat belt laws started appearing from 1984 through 1993. To
this day, seat belt legislation consists of fifty state mandates, with nothing at the federal
level. A bottom-up movement that worked. And there are many more examples—
smoking bans in public places, toxic waste cleanups, narcotics enforcement.
Public outcry is a powerful force for change. And it can work in obesity. I am proud
to be part of an advocacy group in Walnut Creek, California, called the Wellness City
Challenge (www.wellnesscitychallenge.com), led by chef Cindy Gershen. This woman
is a true force of nature. Espousing real food to combat disease and promote happiness,
she has almost singlehandedly mobilized the Mayor’s Office, the Chamber of
Commerce, the Board of Education, Kaiser Permanente and other hospitals, the
Restaurant Association, the local Safeway supermarkets, and SYSCO (the food
procurement company) to completely retool every public food venue in the cities of
Martinez and Concord for one year. The vending machines have been restocked with
apples and oranges, and there’s nary a soda to be found. As part of the intervention,
students at Mount Diablo High School are learning to cook by serving real food for the
teachers at breakfast. The kids can’t believe the teachers are losing weight and happy to
come to work and teach; and now they themselves want the real food instead of the stuff
from their traditional fast food concessions. This demonstration project has many
supporters, including the American Heart Association, and has caught the eye of many
benefactors, who see the power in the message.
Hopefully you do, too. While this book is about the dispassionate science and logic
of obesity and how it can help individuals and society, I’m a human being as well. I get
sick when I think of what’s happened to us, our country, and our planet. This book is my
outcry for a better world for our children. Time to cry out—and just maybe our children
will Inherit the Earth.

# Acknowledgments
hile I am responsible for everything this book says, I didn’t come to all its
conclusions by myself. I have scores of collaborators, and people to acknowledge
and thank. And they deserve to take a bow.
My journey into the world of obesity began sixteen years ago at St. Jude Children’s
Research Hospital in Memphis, where Tom Merchant, Melissa Hudson, Pam Hinds,
Robbin and Mike Christensen, Shengjie Wu, Xiaoping Xiong, Bob Danish, Randi
Schreiber, Susan Post, Susan Rose, and George Burghen were instrumental in the initial
work in children with obesity due to brain tumors. At the University of Tennessee, I am
indebted to Pedro Velasquez-Meyer, Kathy Spencer, Beth Connelly, Ann Cashion,
Cynthia Buffington, and Judy Soberman for our initial adult observations.
The majority of the work and the formulations espoused in this book stem from my
last eleven years at the University of California, San Francisco. I have stellar
colleagues in the Weight Assessment for Teen and Child Health (WATCH) program,
including Andrea Garber, Kristine Madsen, Patrika Tsai, Cam-Tu Tran, Luis
Rodriguez, Joan Valente, Lisa Groesz, Hannah Thompson, Michael Gonzaga, Maria
Martin, Diane Luce, Meghan Gould, Frank Brodie, Rachel Lipman, Kelly Jordan, and
Sally Elliott. These are the people who have done the heavy lifting, and also the ones
who keep me honest. My colleagues studying stress and addiction in the Center for
Obesity Assessment, Study and Treatment (COAST) are Elissa Epel, Barbara Laraia,
Nancy Adler, Rick Hecht, Peter Bacchetti, Nancy Hills, Janet
Tomiyama, Laurel
Mellin, Naomi Stotland, and Mel Heyman. Our fructose work is a team effort between
UCSF (Kathy Mulligan, Sue Noworolski, Viva Tai, and Mike Wen) and Touro
University (Jean-Marc Schwarz and Alejandro Gugliucci). At University of California
at Berkeley, I am indebted to members of the Center for Weight and Health (CWH),
including Pat Crawford, Lorene Ritchie, Gail Woodward-Lopez, Sharon Fleming,
Joanne Ikeda, George Brooks, Aarthi Raman, and Sushma Sharma. At the UC Berkeley
Center for Environmental Research and Children’s Health (CERCH) are Brenda
Eskenazi, Kim Harley, Asa Bradman, and Nina Holland. Our surgical work includes
Diana Farmer, Shinjiro Hirose, Marco Patti, Bill Aldrich, John Kral, and at the
University of Rochester, Thad Boss (deceased) and Jeff Peters. I have stellar obesity
colleagues in the basic sciences at UCSF as well, in particular, Holly Ingraham,
Christian Vaisse, Lynda Frassetto, Allison Xu, Eric Verdin, Bob Farese, Suneil
Koliwad, Kaveh Ashrafi, and Larry Tecott, who have taught me so much. Special
mention also goes to Stan Glantz and Neal Benowitz at the Center for Tobacco
Research. Our advocacy work includes chef Cindy Gershen, Julie Kaufmann of the
American Heart Association, Andrea Bloom of ConnectWell, and Tim Luedtke of

I would also like to acknowledge several other pediatric investigators around the
world for their help and camaraderie as we all try to stem the tide of the obesity
epidemic. David Ludwig (
Ending the Food Fight
), Fran Kaufman (
Diabesity
), Miriam
Vos (
The No-Diet Obesity Solution for Kids
), and Peter Gluckman (
Fat, Fate, and
Disease
) have already jumped into the fray with books for the public. Special
acknowledgments also go to Jack Yanovski, Sonia Caprio, Dennis Styne, Silva
Arslanian, Mike Freemark, Jeff Schwimmer, Dick Jackson, Ram Weiss, Martin
Wabitsch, Hermann Müller, Christian Roth, Felix Kreier, Franco Chiarelli, Takehiko
Ohzeki, and Ze’ev Hochberg. A call-out to Kevin Boyd of Chicago, a pediatric dentist
and the world’s first paleodontist. Other notables include Bruce McEwen and Rudy
Leibel. And also Gary Taubes for keeping me grounded.
I also want to acknowledge two non-medical people I’ve never met, and who
figured this stuff out by themselves without any help: David Gillespie, a lawyer from
Brisbane, Australia, and Nicholas Krilanovich, a retired electrical engineer in Seattle.
They deserve enormous credit for sharing their messages, and going it alone.
In particular, I want to thank an unbelievably talented and enthusiastic cadre of
students, post-docs, and mentees for all their hard work, grant generation, and paper
production; for their good fellowship; for putting up with me; and for making me look
good. Kudos to pre-docs Renee Matos, Jessica Myers, Emily King, Jason Langheier,
Annie Valente, Marcia Wertz, and Paula Yoffe. My obesity post-docs have included
Chaluntorn Preeyasombat, Elvira Isganaitis, Clement Cheung, Drew Bremer, Stephanie
Nguyen, Carolyn Jasik, Ivy Aslan, Lisa Goldman Rosas, Anjali Jain, and Emily Perito.
Junior faculty include Jyu-Lin Chen, Anisha Patel, and Janet Wojcicki, and also some
not-so-junior visiting professors: Anastasia Hadjiyannakis (Canada), Young Eun Choi
(Korea), Jung Sub Lim (Korea), and Xiaonan Li (China).
This book is really the brainchild of my agent, Janis Donnaud. She found me, and
convinced me that my voice was unique, that this book was necessary, and that the
world needed it. Agents are usually interested in the product and the money. Not Janis.
She is a thinker, a visionary. This book is the product of a three-year roller-coaster
ride. Janis rode it bare-knuckled along with me and saw it to the end. Thanks as well to
my editor, Amy Dietz, for her passion, humor, and unique point of view. And to my
publisher, Caroline Sutton, for seeing what others couldn’t. I’d also like to thank
Marcia and Mark Elias and Doris Levin for critiquing the first draft of this book, Bob
Hunt for historical recollections, Matt Chamberlain for his computer prowess, and
Glenn Randle for his graphic genius.
But most important, I must thank my various families. First, my biological family—
my wife, Julie; my daughters, Miriam and Meredith; my parents, Judy and Dick; and my
sister, Carole. Aside from teaching me everything I know about genetics, they have all
stood by me and loved me throughout, especially during the writing of this book on top
of my day job. It seems trite to say I couldn’t have done it without them, but indeed they
were and always are my inspiration. And I must thank my adopted family,
my
colleagues at UCSF Pediatric Endocrinology; the most productive academic division
with the fewest people in the country. Mel Grumbach, Felix Conte, Selna Kaplan
(deceased), Steve Gitelman, Steve Rosenthal, and Saleh Adi are indeed my family—a
dysfunctional one, to be sure, but family nonetheless. And lastly, I give my most special
thanks to the three smartest, most logical, most scientific, fairest, most caring, and most
loving people in science it is my fortune to call my friends. Without any one of them, I’d
have given up long ago. First, my UCSF division head, Walter Miller, a brilliant
scientist and physician with a mind like a steel trap, who has led by example, has
always been supportive, and has always been there to help parse the criticisms and the
politics. Second, Howard Federoff, the executive dean of Georgetown University
Medical Center, perhaps the most complete human being ever to walk the earth.
Howard is the ultimate role model, someone to emulate on every level. Talking science
with Howard is tantamount to a religious awakening. Howard has never stopped
believing in me, even when I didn’t believe in myself. To be considered his friend is
among the most satisfying aspects of my life. Lastly, my scientific soul sister, co-
director of the Childhood Obesity Institute at Children’s National Medical Center,
Michele Mietus-Snyder. I’m sure if you asked her, she would tell you I taught her more
than she taught me, but don’t believe it. If it weren’t for her scientific acumen, her
critical thinking, and her genuine altruistic goodness, I seriously doubt this book would
ever have taken shape.
I love you all.

# Glossary
ALT:
 alanine aminotransferase—a blood test that tells about liver function, and is very
sensitive to the amount of fat in the liver
Amygdala:
 the area of the brain that generates the feeling of fear and stress, and causes
the body to make extra cortisol
Autonomic nervous system:
 that part of the nervous system that controls unconscious
functions of the body; the sympathetic system controls heart rate, blood pressure, and
temperature; while the parasympathetic system controls eating, digestion, and
absorption—the two together control energy balance
Cortisol:
 the stress hormone that acutely mobilizes sugar for use, but that chronically
lays down visceral fat
Developmental programming:
 alterations in brain or body functioning due to
alterations in the environment that occur in the fetus prior to birth
Dopamine:
 a neurotransmitter that when released acutely can cause feelings of reward,
but when released chronically reduces its effect, leading to tolerance
Dopamine D

 receptor:
 the protein that binds dopamine to generate the reward signal,
and that is reduced in density to lead to tolerance
Endocannabinoid:
 a neurotransmitter that binds to brain receptors and acts like
marijuana, driving reward
Enteral:
 entering the body via the mouth
Epigenetics:
 modifications in DNA without changes in the DNA genetic sequence,
usually occurring prior to birth
Estrogen:
 female sex hormone, made either in the ovary or in fat tissue
Ghrelin:
 a hormone made by the stomach that conveys a signal of hunger to the
hypothalamus
Hypothalamus:
 the area at the base of the brain that controls hormone release from
various glands
Insulin:
 the hormone that tells the liver to store glycogen, the fat cells to store energy,
and interferes with the leptin signal to increase food intake
Insulin resistance:
 the state where insulin signaling is reduced, requiring the beta-cells
of the pancreas to make more insulin
Insulin secretion:
 the process of insulin release in response to both rising blood
glucose and the firing of the vagus nerve
Leptin:
 a hormone released from fat cells that travels in the bloodstream to the
hypothalamus to report on peripheral energy stores
Leptin resistance:
 the state where the leptin signal is dampened, leading to the
hypothalamus interpreting starvation
Maillard reaction:
 the binding of a simple sugar (glucose or fructose) to a protein,
making the protein less flexible, and generating reactive oxygen species in the process
Metabolic syndrome:
 a cluster of chronic metabolic diseases characterized by energy
overload of the mitochondria
Micronutrient:
 vitamins or minerals found in real food, usually isolated with the fiber
fraction
Mitochondria:
 areas within the cell that burn either fat or carbohydrate for energy
Neurotransmitter:
 a chemical in the brain, made in one nerve cell, that when released
causes other nerve cells to fire
Nucleus accumbens (NA):
 the area of the brain that receives the dopamine signal and
interprets this as reward
Obesity:
 excess body fat deposition
Obesogen:
 a chemical that increases the amount of fat stored, to a greater extent than
the calories released when it is burned
Octreotide:
 a drug similar to the hormone somatostatin that suppresses numerous
hormones in the body, especially growth hormone and insulin
Parenteral:
 entering the body via injection, as into a muscle or vein
Peptide YY
(3-36)
:
 a hormone made by the small intestine, in response to food, that
signals satiety to the hypothalamus
Peroxisome:
 an area of the cell that contains antioxidants to detoxify reactive oxygen
species
Reactive oxygen species:
 chemicals generated from cellular metabolism that can
cause protein or lipid damage, and can lead to cell dysfunction or death if not
detoxified by antioxidants
Satiety:
 the feeling of fullness, mediated by PYY
(3-36)
 action in the hypothalamus
Subcutaneous fat:
 the fat outside of the abdomen, which is a storehouse of extra
energy but does not signify an increased risk for metabolic syndrome
Sympathetic nervous system:
 that part of the autonomic nervous system that raises
heart rate, increases blood pressure, and burns energy
Tolerance:
 the state where the signal for reward is dampened and can be generated
only with the consumption of more substrate (in the case of obesity, palatable food)
Transcription factor:
 a protein in cells that turns on genes to make the cells change
their function
Type 1 diabetes:
 a disease of high blood sugar due to inadequate insulin production by
the beta-cells of the pancreas
Type 2 diabetes:
 a disease of high blood sugar due to defective insulin action on
tissues
Vagus nerve:
 that part of the autonomic nervous system that promotes food digestion,
absorption, and energy storage
Ventral tegmental area (VTA):
 the area of the brain that sends the dopamine signal
signifying reward to the nucleus accumbens
Ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH):
 the area of the hypothalamus that receives
hormonal information from the body to regulate energy balance
Visceral fat:
 the fat around the organs in the abdomen that is a risk factor for diabetes,
heart disease, and stroke, and a marker for metabolic syndrome
