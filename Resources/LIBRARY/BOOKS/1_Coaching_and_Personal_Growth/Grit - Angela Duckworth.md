Praise for
Grit: The Power of Passion
and Perseverance
“Profoundly important. For eons, we’ve
been trapped inside the myth of innate
talent. Angela Duckworth shines a bright
light into a truer understanding of how
we achieve. We owe her a great debt.”
—David Shenk, author of

The Genius in
All of Us: New Insights into Genetics,
Talent, and IQ
“Enlightening . . .
Grit
 teaches that life’s
high peaks aren’t necessarily conquered
by the naturally nimble but, rather, by
those willing to endure, wait out the
storm, and try again.”
—Ed Viesturs, seven-time climber of
Mount Everest and author of

No
Shortcuts to the Top
“Masterful . . .
Grit
 offers a truly sane
perspective: that true success comes
when we devote ourselves to endeavors
that give us joy and purpose.”
—Arianna Huffington, author of

Thrive
“Readable, compelling, and totally
persuasive. The ideas in this book have
the potential to transform education,
management, and the way its readers
live. Angela Duckworth’s
Grit
 is a
national treasure.”
—Lawrence H. Summers, former
secretary of the treasury and President
Emeritus at Harvard University
“Fascinating. Angela Duckworth pulls
together decades of psychological
research, inspiring success stories from
business and sports, and her own unique
personal experience and distills it all
into a set of practical strategies to make
yourself and your children more
motivated, more passionate, and more
persistent at work and at school.”
—Paul Tough, author of

How Children
Succeed
“A thoughtful and engaging exploration
of what predicts success.
Grit
 takes on
widespread misconceptions and
predictors of what makes us strive
harder and push further . . . Duckworth’s
own story, wound throughout her
research, ends up demonstrating her
theory best: passion and perseverance
make up grit.”
—Tory Burch, chairman, CEO and
designer of Tory Burch
“An important book . . . In these pages,
the leading scholarly expert on the
power of grit (what my mom called
‘stick-to-it-iveness’) carries her
message to a wider audience, using apt
anecdotes and aphorisms to illustrate
how we can usefully apply her insights
to our own lives and those of our kids.”
—Robert D. Putnam, professor of public
policy at Harvard University and author
of

Bowling Alone

and

Our Kids
“Empowering . . . Angela Duckworth
compels attention with her idea that
regular individuals who exercise self-
control and perseverance can reach as
high as those who are naturally talented
—that your mindset is as important as
your mind.”
—Soledad O’Brien, chairman of Starfish
Media Group and former coanchor of
CNN’s

American Morning
“Invaluable . . . In a world where access
to knowledge is unprecedented, this
book describes the key trait of those who
will optimally take advantage of it.
Grit
will inspire everyone who reads it to
stick to something hard that they have a
passion for.”
—Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy
“I love an idea that challenges our
conventional wisdom and
Grit
 does just
that! Put aside what you think you know
about getting ahead and outlasting your
competition, even if they are more
talented. Getting smarter won’t help you
—sticking with it will!”
—Simon Sinek, author of

Start With
Why

and

Leaders Eat Last
“Incredibly important . . . There is
deeply embodied grit, which is born of
love, purpose, truth to one’s core under
ferocious heat, and a relentless passion
for what can only be revealed on the
razor’s edge; and there is the cool,
patient, disciplined cultivation and study
of resilience that can teach us all how to
get there. Angela Duckworth’s
masterpiece straddles both worlds,
offering a level of nuance that I haven’t
read before.”
—Josh Waitzkin, international chess
master, Tai Chi Push Hands world
champion, and author of

# Preface
Growing up, I heard the word
genius
 a
lot.
It was always my dad who brought it
up. He liked to say, apropos of nothing at
all, “You know, you’re no genius!” This
pronouncement might come in the middle
of dinner, during a commercial break for
The Love Boat
, or after he flopped down
on the couch with the
Wall Street
Journal
.
I don’t remember how I responded.
Maybe I pretended not to hear.
My dad’s thoughts turned frequently
to genius, talent, and who had more than
whom. He was deeply concerned with
how smart he was. He was deeply
concerned with how smart his family
was.
I wasn’t the only problem. My dad
didn’t think my brother and sister were
geniuses, either. By his yardstick, none
of us measured up to Einstein.
Apparently, this was a great
disappointment. Dad worried that this
intellectual handicap would limit what
we’d eventually achieve in life.
Two years ago, I was fortunate
enough to be awarded a MacArthur
Fellowship, sometimes called the
“genius grant.” You don’t apply for the
MacArthur. You don’t ask your friends
or colleagues to nominate you. Instead, a
secret committee that includes the top
people in your field decides you’re
doing important and creative work.
When I received the unexpected call
telling me the news, my first
reaction
was one of gratitude and amazement.
Then my thoughts turned to my dad and
his offhand diagnoses of my intellectual
potential. He wasn’t wrong; I didn’t win
the MacArthur because I’m leagues
smarter than my fellow psychologists.
Instead, he had the right answer (“No,
she’s not”) to the wrong question (“Is
she a genius?”).
There was about a month between the
MacArthur call and its official
announcement. Apart from my husband, I
wasn’t permitted to tell anyone. That
gave me time to ponder the irony of the
situation. A girl who is told repeatedly
that she’s no genius ends up winning an
award for being one. The award goes to
her because she has discovered that
what we eventually accomplish may
depend more on our passion and
perseverance than on our innate talent.
She has by then amassed degrees from
some pretty tough schools, but in the
third grade, she didn’t test high enough
for the gifted and talented program. Her
parents are Chinese immigrants, but she
didn’t get lectured on the salvation of
hard work. Against stereotype, she can’t
play a note of piano or violin.
The morning the MacArthur was
announced, I walked over to my parents’
apartment. My mom and dad had already
heard the news, and so had several
“aunties,” who were calling in rapid
succession to offer congratulations.
Finally, when the phone stopped ringing,
my dad turned to me and said, “I’m
proud of you.”
I had so much to say in response, but
instead I just said, “Thanks, Dad.”
There was no sense rehashing the
past. I knew that, in fact, he
was
 proud of
me.
Still, part of me wanted to travel back
in time to when I was a young girl. I’d
tell him what I know now.
I would say, “Dad, you say I’m no
genius. I won’t argue with that. You
know plenty of people who are smarter
than I am.” I can imagine his head
nodding in sober agreement.
“But let me tell you something. I’m
going to grow up to love my
work as
much as you love yours. I won’t just
have a job; I’ll have a calling. I’ll
challenge myself every day. When I get
knocked down, I’ll get back up. I may
not be the smartest person in the room,
but I’ll strive to be the grittiest.”
And if he was still listening: “In the
long run, Dad, grit may matter more than
talent.”
All these years later, I have the
scientific evidence to prove my point.
What’s more, I know that grit is mutable,
not fixed, and I have insights from
research about how to grow it.
This book summarizes everything
I’ve learned about grit.
When I finished writing it, I went to
visit my dad. Chapter by chapter, over
the course of days, I read him every line.
He’s been battling Parkinson’s disease
for the last decade or so, and I’m not
entirely sure how much he understood.
Still, he seemed to be listening intently,
and when I was done, he looked at me.
After what felt like an eternity, he
nodded once. And then he smiled.

Part I
# What Grit Is
# And Why It
# Matters

Chapter 1
# Showing Up
By the time you set foot on the campus of
the United States Military Academy at
West Point, you’ve earned it.
The admissions process for West
Point is at least as rigorous as for the
most selective universities. Top scores
on the SAT or ACT and outstanding high
school grades are a must. But when you
apply to Harvard, you don’t need to start
your application in the eleventh grade,
and you don’t need to secure a
nomination from a member of Congress,
a senator, or the vice president of the
United States. You don’t, for that matter,
have to get superlative marks in a fitness
assessment that includes running, push-
ups, sit-ups, and pull-ups.
Each year, in their junior year of high
school,
more than 14,000 applicants
begin the admissions process. This pool
is winnowed to just 4,000 who succeed
in getting the required nomination.
Slightly more than half of those
applicants—about 2,500—meet West
Point’s rigorous academic and physical
standards, and from that select group just
1,200 are admitted and enrolled. Nearly
all the men and women who come to
West Point were varsity athletes; most
were team captains.
And yet, one in five cadets will
drop
out before graduation. What’s more
remarkable is that, historically, a
substantial fraction of dropouts
leave in
their very first summer, during an
intensive seven-week training program
named, even in official literature, Beast
Barracks. Or, for short, just Beast.
Who spends two years trying to get
into a place and then drops out in the
first two months?
Then again, these are no ordinary
months. Beast is described in the West
Point handbook for new cadets as “the
most physically and emotionally
demanding part of your four years at
West Point . . . designed to help you
make the transition from
new cadet to
Soldier.”

The day begins at 5:00 a.m. By 5:30,
cadets are in formation, standing at
attention, honoring the raising of the
United States flag. Then follows a hard
workout—running or calisthenics—
followed by a nonstop rotation of
marching in formation, classroom
instruction, weapons
training, and
athletics. Lights out, to a melancholy
bugle song called “Taps,” occurs at
10:00 p.m. And on the next day the
routine starts over again. Oh, and there
are no weekends, no breaks other than
meals, and virtually no contact with
family and friends outside of West Point.
One cadet’s description of Beast:
“You are challenged in a variety of ways
in every developmental area—mentally,
physically, militarily, and socially. The
system will find your weaknesses, but
that’s the point—
West Point toughens
you.”
So, who makes it through Beast?
It was 2004 and my second year of
graduate school in psychology when I set
about answering that question, but for
decades, the U.S. Army has been asking
the same thing. In fact, it was in 1955—
almost fifty years before I began
working on this puzzle—that a young
psychologist named Jerry Kagan was
drafted into the army, ordered to report
to West Point, and assigned to test new
cadets for the purpose of identifying who
would stay
and who would leave. As
fate would have it, Jerry was not only
the first psychologist to study dropping
out at West Point, he was also the first
psychologist I met in college. I ended up
working part-time in his lab for two
years.
Jerry described early efforts to
separate the wheat from the chaff at West
Point as dramatically unsuccessful. He
recalled in particular spending hundreds
of hours showing cadets cards printed
with pictures and asking the young men
to make up stories to fit them. This test
was meant to unearth deep-seated,
unconscious motives, and the general
idea was that cadets who visualized
noble deeds and courageous
accomplishments should be the ones
who would graduate instead of dropping
out. Like a lot of ideas that sound good
in principle, this one didn’t work so
well in practice. The stories the cadets
told were colorful and fun to listen to,
but they had absolutely nothing to do
with decisions the cadets made in their
actual lives.
Since then, several more generations
of psychologists devoted themselves to
the attrition issue, but not one researcher
could say with much certainty why some
of the most promising cadets routinely
quit when their training had just begun.
Soon after learning about Beast, I
found my way to the office of Mike
Matthews, a military psychologist who’s
been a West Point faculty member for
years. Mike explained that the
West
Point admissions process successfully
identified men and women who had the
potential to thrive there. In particular,
admissions staff calculate for each
applicant something called the Whole
Candidate Score, a weighted average of
SAT or ACT exam scores, high school
rank adjusted for the number of students
in the applicant’s graduating class,
expert appraisals of leadership
potential, and performance on objective
measures of physical fitness.
You can think of the Whole Candidate
Score as West Point’s best guess at how
much talent applicants have for the
diverse rigors of its four-year program.
In other words, it’s an estimate of how
easily cadets will master the many skills
required of a military leader.
The Whole Candidate Score is the
single most important factor in West
Point admissions, and yet it
didn’t
reliably predict who would make it
through Beast. In fact, cadets with the
highest Whole Candidate Scores were
just as likely to drop out as
those with
the lowest. And this was why Mike’s
door was open to me.
From his own experience joining the
air force as a young man, Mike had a
clue to the riddle. While the rigors of his
induction weren’t quite as harrowing as
those of West Point, there were notable
similarities. The most important were
challenges that exceeded current skills.
For the first time in their lives, Mike and
the other recruits were being asked, on
an hourly basis, to do things they
couldn’t yet do. “Within two weeks,”
Mike recalls, “
I was tired, lonely,
frustrated, and ready to quit—as were
all of my classmates.”
Some did quit, but Mike did not.
What struck Mike was that rising to
the occasion had almost nothing to do
with talent. Those who dropped out of
training rarely did so from lack of
ability. Rather, what mattered, Mike
said, was a “
never give up” attitude.
Around that time, it wasn’t just Mike
Matthews who was talking to me about
this kind of hang-in-there posture toward
challenge. As a graduate student just
beginning to probe the psychology of
success, I was interviewing leaders in
business, art, athletics, journalism,
academia, medicine, and law:
Who are
the people at the very top of your field?
What are they like? What do you think
makes them special?
Some of the characteristics that
emerged in these interviews were very
field-specific. For instance, more than
one businessperson mentioned an
appetite for taking financial risks:
“You’ve got to be able to make
calculated decisions about millions of
dollars and still go to sleep at night.”
But this seemed entirely beside the point
for artists, who instead mentioned a
drive to create: “I like making stuff. I
don’t know why, but I do.” In contrast,
athletes mentioned a different kind of
motivation, one driven by the thrill of
victory: “Winners love to go head-to-
head with other people. Winners hate
losing.”
In addition to these particulars, there
emerged certain commonalities, and they
were what interested me most. No matter
the field, the most successful people
were lucky and talented. I’d heard that
before, and I didn’t doubt it.
But the story of success didn’t end
there. Many of the people I talked to
could also recount tales of rising stars
who, to everyone’s surprise, dropped
out or lost interest before they could
realize their potential.
Apparently, it was critically
important—and not at all easy—to keep
going after failure: “Some people are
great when things are going well, but
they fall apart when things aren’t.” High
achievers described
in these interviews
really stuck it out: “This one guy, he
wasn’t actually the best writer at the
beginning. I mean, we used to read his
stories and have a laugh because the
writing was so, you know, clumsy and
melodramatic. But he got better and
better, and last year he won a
Guggenheim.” And they were constantly
driven to improve: “She’s never
satisfied. You’d think she would be, by
now, but she’s her own harshest critic.”
The highly accomplished were paragons
of perseverance.
Why were the highly accomplished so
dogged in their pursuits? For most, there
was no realistic expectation of ever
catching up to their ambitions. In their
own eyes, they were never good enough.
They were the opposite of complacent.
And yet, in a very real sense, they were
satisfied being unsatisfied. Each was
chasing something of unparalleled
interest and importance, and it was the
chase—as much as the capture—that
was gratifying. Even if some of the
things they had to do were boring, or
frustrating, or even painful, they
wouldn’t dream of giving up. Their
passion was enduring.
In sum, no matter the domain, the
highly successful had a kind of ferocious
determination that played out in two
ways. First, these exemplars were
unusually resilient and hardworking.
Second, they knew in a very, very deep
way what it was they wanted. They not
only had determination, they had
direction
.
It was this combination of passion
and perseverance that made high
achievers special. In a word, they had
grit.
For me, the question became: How do
you measure something so intangible?
Something that decades of military
psychologists hadn’t been able to
quantify? Something those very
successful people I’d interviewed said
they could recognize on sight, but
couldn’t think of how to directly test for?
I sat down and looked over my
interview notes. And I started writing
questions that captured, sometimes
verbatim, descriptions of what it means
to have grit.
Half of the questions were about
perseverance. They asked how much you
agree with statements like “I have
overcome setbacks to conquer an
important challenge” and “I finish
whatever I begin.”
The other half of the questions were
about passion. They asked whether your
“interests change from year to year” and
the extent to which you “have been
obsessed with a certain idea or project
for a short time but later lost interest.”
What emerged was the Grit Scale—a
test that, when taken honestly, measures
the extent to which you approach life
with grit.
In July 2004, on the second day of Beast,
1,218 West Point cadets sat down to take
the Grit Scale.
The day before, cadets had said
good-bye to their moms and dads (a
farewell for which West Point allocates
exactly ninety seconds), gotten their
heads shaved (just the men), changed out
of civilian clothing and into the famous
gray and white West Point uniform, and
received their footlockers, helmets, and
other gear. Though they may have
mistakenly thought they already knew
how, they were instructed by a fourth-
year cadet in the proper way to stand in
line (“Step up to my line! Not on my
line, not over my line, not behind my
line. Step up
to
 my line!”).
Initially, I looked to see how grit
scores lined up with aptitude. Guess
what? Grit scores bore absolutely no
relationship to the Whole Candidate
Scores that had been so painstakingly
calculated during the admissions
process. In other words, how talented a
cadet was said nothing about their grit,
and vice versa.
The separation of grit from talent was
consistent with Mike’s observations of
air force training, but when I first
stumbled onto this finding it came as a
real surprise. After all, why
shouldn’t
the talented endure? Logically, the
talented should stick around and try
hard, because when
they do, they do
phenomenally well. At West Point, for
example, among cadets who ultimately
make it through Beast, the Whole
Candidate Score is a marvelous
predictor of every metric West Point
tracks. It not only predicts academic
grades, but military and
physical fitness
marks as well.
So it’s surprising, really, that talent is
no guarantee of grit. In this book, we’ll
explore the reasons why.
By the last day of Beast,
seventy-one
cadets had dropped out.
Grit turned out to be an astoundingly
reliable predictor of who made it
through and who did not.
The next year, I returned to West
Point to run the same study. This time,
sixty-two cadets dropped out of Beast,
and again grit predicted who would stay.
In contrast, stayers and leavers had
indistinguishable Whole Candidate
Scores. I looked a little closer at the
individual components that make up the
score. Again, no differences.
So, what matters for making it through
Beast?
Not your SAT scores, not your high
school rank, not your leadership
experience, not your athletic ability.
Not your Whole Candidate Score.
What matters is grit.
Does grit matter beyond West Point? To
find out, I looked for other situations so
challenging that a lot of people drop out.
I wanted to know whether it was just the
rigors of Beast that demanded grit, or
whether, in general, grit helped people
stick to their commitments.
The next arena where I tested grit’s
power was sales, a profession in which
daily, if not hourly, rejection is par for
the course. I asked hundreds of men and
women employed at the same vacation
time-share
company to answer a battery
of personality questionnaires, including
the Grit Scale. Six months later, I
revisited the company, by which time

percent of the salespeople were gone.
Grit predicted who stayed and who left.
Moreover, no other commonly measured
personality trait—including
extroversion, emotional stability, and
conscientiousness—was as effective as
grit in predicting job retention.
Around the same time, I received a
call from the Chicago Public Schools.
Like the psychologists at West Point,
researchers there were eager to learn
more about the students who would
successfully earn their high school
diplomas. That spring, thousands of high
school juniors completed an abbreviated
Grit Scale, along with a battery of other
questionnaires. More than a year later,
12 percent of those students failed to
graduate. Students who graduated on
schedule were grittier, and grit was a
more powerful predictor of graduation
than how much students cared about
school, how conscientious they were
about their studies, and even how safe
they felt at school.
Likewise, in two large American
samples, I found that grittier adults were
more likely to get further in their formal
schooling. Adults who’d earned an
MBA, PhD, MD, JD, or another
graduate
degree were grittier than those who’d
only graduated from four-year colleges,
who were in turn grittier than those
who’d accumulated some college credits
but no degree. Interestingly, adults
who’d successfully earned degrees from
two-year colleges scored slightly higher
than graduates of four-year colleges.
This puzzled me at first, but I soon
learned that the dropout rates at
community colleges can be
as high as 80
percent. Those who defy the odds are
especially gritty.
In parallel, I started a partnership
with the Army Special Operations
Forces, better known as the Green
Berets. These are among the army’s
best-trained soldiers, assigned some of
the toughest and most dangerous
missions. Training for the Green Berets
is a grueling, multistage affair. The stage
I studied comes
after
 nine weeks of boot
camp, four weeks of infantry training,
three weeks of airborne school,
and four
weeks of a preparation course focused
on land navigation. All these preliminary
training experiences are very, very hard,
and at every stage there are men who
don’t make it through. But the Special
Forces Selection Course is even harder.
In the words of its commanding general,
James Parker, this is “
where we decide
who will and who will not” enter the
final stages of Green Beret training.
The Selection Course makes Beast
Barracks look like summer vacation.
Starting before dawn, trainees go full-
throttle until nine in the evening. In
addition to daytime and nighttime
navigation exercises, there are four- and
six-mile runs and marches, sometimes
under a sixty-five-pound load, and
attempts at an obstacle course informally
known as “Nasty Nick,” which includes
crawling through water under barbed
wire, walking on elevated logs,
negotiating cargo nets, and swinging
from horizontal ladders.
Just getting to the Selection Course is
an accomplishment, but even so,

percent of the candidates I studied
voluntarily withdrew before it was over.
So what distinguished the men who
made it through? Grit.
What else, other than grit, predicts
success in the military, education, and
business? In sales, I found that prior
experience helps—novices are less
likely to keep their jobs than those with
experience. In the Chicago public school
system, a supportive teacher made it
more likely that students would graduate.
And for aspiring Green Berets, baseline
physical fitness at the start of training is
essential.
But in each of these domains, when
you compare people matched on these
characteristics, grit still predicts
success. Regardless of specific
attributes and advantages that help
someone succeed in each of these
diverse domains of challenge, grit
matters in all of them.
The year I started graduate school, the
documentary
Spellbound
 was released.
The film follows three boys and five
girls as they prepare for and compete in
the finals of the Scripps National
Spelling Bee.
To get to the finals—an
adrenaline-filled three-day affair staged
annually in Washington, DC, and
broadcast live on ESPN, which normally
focuses its programming on high-stakes
sports matchups—these kids must first
“outspell” thousands of other students
from hundreds of schools across the
country. This means spelling
increasingly obscure words without a
single error, in round after round, first
besting all the other students in the
contestant’s classroom, then in their
grade, school, district, and region.
Spellbound
 got me wondering: To
what extent is flawlessly spelling words
like
schottische
 and
cymotrichous
 a
matter of precocious verbal talent, and
to what extent is grit at play?
I called the Bee’s executive director,
a dynamic woman (and former champion
speller herself) named Paige Kimble.
Kimble was as curious as I was to learn
more about the psychological makeup of
winners. She agreed to send out
questionnaires
to all 273 spellers just as
soon as they qualified for the finals,
which would take place several months
later. In return for the princely reward of
a $25 gift card, about two-thirds of the
spellers returned the questionnaires to
my lab. The oldest respondent was
fifteen years old, the absolute age limit
according to competition rules, and the
youngest was just seven.
In addition to completing the Grit
Scale, spellers reported how much time
they devoted to spelling practice. On
average, they practiced more than an
hour a day on weekdays and more than
two hours a day on weekends. But there
was a lot of variation around these
averages: some spellers were hardly
studying at all, and some were studying
as much as nine hours on a given
Saturday!
Separately, I contacted a subsample
of spellers and administered a verbal
intelligence test. As a group, the spellers
demonstrated unusual verbal ability. But
there was a fairly wide range of scores,
with some kids scoring at the verbal
prodigy level and others “average” for
their age.
When ESPN aired the final rounds of
the competition, I watched
all the way
through to the concluding suspenseful
moments when, at last, thirteen-year-old
Anurag Kashyap correctly spelled A-P-
P-O-G-G-I-A-T-U-R-A (a musical term
for a kind of grace note) to win the
championship.
Then, with the final rankings in hand,
I analyzed my data.
Here’s what I found: measurements of
grit taken months before the final
competition predicted how well spellers
would eventually perform. Put simply,
grittier kids went further in competition.
How did they do it? By studying many
more hours and, also, by competing in
more spelling bees.
What about talent? Verbal
intelligence also predicted getting
further in competition. But there was no
relationship at all between verbal IQ
and grit. What’s more, verbally talented
spellers did not study any more than less
able spellers, nor did they have a longer
track record of competition.
The separation of grit and talent
emerged again in a separate study I ran
on Ivy League undergraduates. There,
SAT scores and grit were, in fact,
inversely correlated. Students in that
select sample who had higher SAT
scores were, on average, just slightly
less gritty than their peers. Putting
together this finding with the other data
I’d collected, I came to a fundamental
insight that would guide my future work:
Our potential is one thing. What we do
with it is quite another.

Chapter 2
# Distracted By
# Talent
Before I was a psychologist, I was a
teacher. It was
in the classroom—years
before I’d even heard of Beast—that I
began to see that talent is not all there is
to achievement.
I was twenty-seven when I started
teaching full-time. The month before, I’d
quit my job at McKinsey, a global
management consulting firm whose New
York City office occupied several floors
of a blue-glass skyscraper in midtown.
My colleagues were a bit bewildered by
my decision. Why leave a company that
most of my peers were dying to join—
one regularly singled out as one of the
world’s smartest and most influential?
Acquaintances assumed I was trading
eighty-hour workweeks for a more
relaxed lifestyle, but of course, anyone
who’s been a teacher knows that there’s
no harder job in the world. So why
leave? In some ways, it was consulting,
not teaching, that was the detour.
Throughout college, I’d tutored and
mentored kids from the local public
schools. After graduation, I started a
tuition-free academic enrichment
program and ran it for two years. Then I
went to Oxford and completed a degree
in neuroscience, studying the neural
mechanisms of dyslexia. So when I
started teaching, I felt like I was back on
track.
Even so, the transition was abrupt. In
a single week, my salary went from
Seriously? I actually get paid this
much?
 to
Wow! How the heck do
teachers in this city make ends meet?
Dinner was now a sandwich eaten
hurriedly while grading papers, not sushi
ordered in at the client’s expense. I
commuted to work on the same subway
line but stayed on the train past midtown,
getting off six stops farther south: the
Lower East Side. Instead of pumps,
pearls, and a tailored suit, I wore
sensible shoes I could stand in all day
and dresses I wouldn’t mind getting
covered in chalk.
My students were twelve and thirteen
years old. Most lived in the housing
projects clustered between Avenues A
and D. This was before the
neighborhood sprouted hip cafés on
every corner. The fall I started teaching
there, our school was picked for the set
of a movie about a rough-and-tumble
school in a distressed urban
neighborhood. My job was to help my
students learn seventh-grade math:
fractions and decimals and the
rudimentary building blocks of algebra
and geometry.
Even that first week, it was obvious
that some of my students picked up
mathematical concepts more easily than
their classmates. Teaching the most
talented students in the class was a joy.
They were, quite literally, “quick
studies.” Without much prompting, they
saw the underlying pattern in a series of
math problems that less able students
struggled to grasp. They’d watch me do
a problem once on the board and say, “I
get it!” and then work out the next one
correctly on their own.
And yet, at the end of the first
marking period, I was surprised to find
that some of these very able students
weren’t doing as well as I’d expected.
Some did very well, of course. But more
than a few of my most talented students
were earning lackluster grades or worse.
In contrast, several of the students
who initially struggled were faring
better than I’d expected. These
“overachievers” would reliably come to
class every day with everything they
needed. Instead of playing around and
looking out the window, they took notes
and asked
questions. When they didn’t
get something the first time around, they
tried again and again, sometimes coming
for extra help during their lunch period
or during afternoon electives. Their hard
work showed in their grades.
Apparently, aptitude did
not
guarantee achievement. Talent for math
was different from excelling in math
class.
This came as a surprise. After all,
conventional wisdom says that math is a
subject in which the more talented
students are expected to excel, leaving
classmates who are simply “not math
people” behind. To be honest, I began
the school year with that very
assumption. It seemed a sure bet that
those for whom things came easily
would continue to outpace their
classmates. In fact, I expected that the
achievement gap separating the naturals
from the rest of the class would only
widen over time.
I’d been distracted by talent.
Gradually, I began to ask myself hard
questions. When I taught a lesson and the
concept failed to gel, could it be that the
struggling student needed to struggle just
a bit longer? Could it be that I needed to
find a different way to explain what I
was trying to get across? Before jumping
to the conclusion that talent was destiny,
should I be considering the importance
of effort? And, as a teacher, wasn’t it my
responsibility to figure out how to
sustain effort—both the students’ and my
own—just a bit longer?
At the same time, I began to reflect on
how smart even my weakest students
sounded when they talked about things
that genuinely interested them. These
were conversations I found almost
impossible to follow: discourses on
basketball statistics, the lyrics to songs
they really liked, and complicated
plotlines about who was no longer
speaking to whom and why. When I got
to know my students better, I discovered
that all of them had mastered any number
of complicated ideas in their very
complicated daily lives. Honestly, was
getting
x
 all by itself in an algebraic
equation all that much harder?
My students weren’t equally talented.
Still, when it came to learning seventh-
grade math, could it be that if they and I
mustered sufficient effort over time,
they’d get to where they needed? Surely,
I thought, they were all talented
enough.
Toward the end of the school year, my
fiancé became my husband. For the sake
of his own post-McKinsey career, we
packed up and moved from New York to
San Francisco. I found a new job
teaching math at Lowell High School.
Compared to my Lower East Side
classroom, Lowell was an alternate
universe.
Tucked away in a perpetually foggy
basin near the Pacific Ocean, Lowell is
the only public high school in San
Francisco that admits students on the
basis of academic merit. The largest
feeder to the University of California
system, Lowell sends many of its
graduates to the country’s most selective
universities.
If, like me, you were raised on the
East Coast, you can think of Lowell as
the Stuyvesant of San Francisco. Such
imagery might bring to mind whiz kids
who are leaps and bounds smarter than
those who lack the top-notch test scores
and grades to get in.
What I discovered was that Lowell
students were distinguished more by
their work ethic than by their
intelligence. I once asked students in my
homeroom how much they studied. The
typical answer? Hours and hours. Not in
a week, but in a single day.
Still, like at any other school, there
was tremendous variation in how hard
students worked and how well they
performed.
Just as I’d found in New York, some
of the students I expected to excel,
because math came so easy to them, did
worse than their classmates. On the other
hand, some of my hardest workers were
consistently my highest performers on
tests and quizzes.
One of these very hard workers was
David Luong.
David was in my freshman algebra
class. There were two kinds of algebra
classes at Lowell: the accelerated track
led to Advanced Placement Calculus by
senior year, and the regular track, which
I was teaching, didn’t. The students in
my class hadn’t scored high enough on
Lowell’s math placement exam to get
into the accelerated track.
David didn’t stand out at first. He
was quiet and sat toward the back of the
room. He didn’t raise his hand a lot; he
rarely volunteered to come to the board
to solve problems.
But I soon noticed that every time I
graded an assignment, David had turned
in perfect work. He aced my quizzes and
tests. When I marked one of his answers
as incorrect, it was more often my error
than his. And, wow, he was just so
hungry to learn. In class, his attention
was rapt. After class, he’d stay and ask,
politely, for harder assignments.
I began to wonder what the heck this
kid was doing in
my
 class.
Once I understood how ridiculous the
situation was, I marched David into the
office of my department chair. It didn’t
take long to explain what was going on.
Fortunately, the chair was a wise and
wonderful teacher who placed a higher
value on kids than on bureaucratic rules.
She immediately started the paperwork
to switch David out of my class and into
the accelerated track.
My loss was the next teacher’s gain.
Of course, there were ups and downs,
and not all of David’s math grades were
A’s. “After I left your class, and
switched into the more advanced one,
I
was a little behind,” David later told
me. “And the next year, math—it was
geometry—continued to be hard. I didn’t
get an A. I got a B.” In the next class, his
first math test came back with a D.
“How did you deal with that?” I
asked.
“I did feel bad—I did—but I didn’t
dwell on it. I knew it was done. I knew I
had to focus on what to do next. So I
went to my teacher and asked for help. I
basically tried to figure out, you know,
what I did wrong. What I needed to do
differently.”
By senior year, David was taking the
harder of Lowell’s two honors calculus
courses. That spring, he earned a perfect
5 out of 5 on the Advanced Placement
exam.
After Lowell, David attended
Swarthmore College, graduating with
dual degrees in engineering and
economics. I sat with his parents at his
graduation, remembering the quiet
student in the back of my classroom who
ended up proving that aptitude tests can
get a lot of things wrong.
Two years ago, David earned a PhD
in mechanical engineering from UCLA.
His dissertation was on optimal
performance algorithms for the
thermodynamic processes in truck
engines. In English: David used math to
help make engines more efficient. Today,
he is an engineer at the Aerospace
Corporation. Quite literally, the boy who
was deemed “not ready” for harder,
faster math classes is now a “rocket
scientist.”
During the next several years of
teaching, I grew less and less convinced
that talent was destiny and more and
more intrigued by the returns generated
by effort. Intent on plumbing the depths
of that mystery, I eventually left teaching
to become a psychologist.
When I got to graduate school, I learned
that psychologists have long wondered
why some people succeed and others
fail. Among the earliest was Francis
Galton, who debated the topic with his
half cousin, Charles Darwin.
By all accounts, Galton was a child
prodigy. By four, he could read and
write. By six, he knew Latin and long
division and could recite passages from
Shakespeare by heart.
Learning came
easy.
In 1869, Galton published his first
scientific study on the origins of high
achievement. After assembling lists of
well-known figures in science, athletics,
music, poetry, and law—among other
domains—he gathered whatever
biographical information he could.
Outliers, Galton concluded, are
remarkable in three ways: they
demonstrate unusual “ability”
in
combination with exceptional “zeal” and
“the
capacity for hard labor.”
After reading the first fifty pages of
Galton’s book, Darwin wrote a letter to
his cousin, expressing surprise that talent
made the short list of essential qualities.
“You have made a convert of an
opponent in one sense,” wrote Darwin.
“For I have always maintained that,
excepting fools, men did not differ much
in intellect, only in zeal and hard work;
and I still think this is an
eminently
important difference.”
Of course, Darwin himself was the
sort of high achiever Galton was trying
to understand. Widely acknowledged as
one of the most influential scientists in
history, Darwin was the first to explain
diversity in plant and animal species as
a consequence of natural selection.
Relatedly, Darwin was an astute
observer, not only of flora and fauna, but
also of people. In a sense, his vocation
was to observe slight differences that
lead, ultimately, to survival.
So it’s worth pausing to consider
Darwin’s opinion on the determinants of
achievement—that is, his belief that zeal
and hard work are ultimately more
important than intellectual ability.
On the whole, Darwin’s biographers
don’t claim he possessed
supernatural
intelligence. He was certainly
intelligent, but insights didn’t come to
him in lightning flashes. He was, in a
sense, a plodder. Darwin’s own
autobiography corroborates this view: “I
have
no great quickness of apprehension
[that] is so remarkable in some clever
men,” he admits. “My power to follow a
long and purely abstract train of thought
is very limited.” He would not have
made a very good mathematician, he
thinks, nor a philosopher, and his
memory was subpar, too: “So poor in
one sense is my memory that I have
never been able to remember for more
than a few days a single date or a line of
poetry.”
Perhaps Darwin was too humble. But
he had no problem praising his power of
observation and the assiduousness with
which he applied it to understanding the
laws of nature: “I think I am superior to
the common run of men in noticing things
which easily escape attention,
and in
observing them carefully. My industry
has been nearly as great as it could have
been in the observation and collection of
facts. What is far more important, my
love of natural science has been steady
and ardent.”
One biographer describes Darwin as
someone who kept thinking about the
same questions long after others would
move on to different—and no doubt
easier—problems:
The normal response to being
puzzled about something is to
say,“I’ll think about this later,” and
then, in effect, forget about it. With
Darwin, one feels that he
deliberately did not engage in this
kind of semi-willful forgetting. He
kept all the questions alive at the
back of his mind, ready to be
retrieved when a relevant bit of
data presented itself.
Forty years later, on the other side of the
Atlantic, a Harvard psychologist named
William James took up the question of
how people differ in their pursuit of
goals. Toward the end of his long and
distinguished career, James wrote an
essay on the topic for
Science
 (then and
now the premier academic journal, not
just for psychology but for all of the
natural and social sciences). It was titled
“
The Energies of Men.”
Reflecting on the achievements and
failures of close friends and colleagues,
and how the quality of his own efforts
varied on his good and bad days, James
observed:
Compared with what we ought to
be, we are only half awake. Our
fires are damped, our drafts are
checked. We are making use of
only a small part of our possible
mental and physical resources.
There is a gap, James declared,
between potential and its actualization.
Without denying
that our talents vary—
one might be more musical
than athletic
or more entrepreneurial than artistic—
James asserted that “the human
individual lives usually far within his
limits; he possesses powers of various
sorts which he habitually fails to use. He
energizes below his maximum, and he
behaves below his optimum.”
“Of course there
are
 limits,” James
acknowledged. “The trees don’t grow
into the sky.” But these outer boundaries
of where we will, eventually, stop
improving are simply irrelevant for the
vast majority of us: “The plain fact
remains that men the world over possess
amounts of resource, which only very
exceptional individuals push to their
extremes of use.”
These words, written in 1907, are as
true today as ever. So, why do we place
such emphasis on talent? And why fixate
on the extreme limits of what we might
do when, in fact, most of us are at the
very beginning of our journey, so far, far
away from those outer bounds? And why
do we assume that it is our talent, rather
than our effort, that will decide where
we end up in the very long run?
For years, several national surveys have
asked: Which is more important to
success—talent or effort? Americans are
about
twice as likely to single out effort.
The same is true when you ask
Americans
about athletic ability. And
when asked, “If you were hiring a new
employee, which of the following
qualities would you think is most
important?” Americans endorse “being
hardworking” nearly five times as often
as they
endorse “intelligence.”
The results of these surveys are
consistent with questionnaires that
psychologist Chia-Jung Tsay has given to
musical experts, who, when asked,
reliably endorse effortful training as
more important than natural talent. But
when Chia probes attitudes more
indirectly, she exposes a bias that tips in
exactly the opposite direction: we love
naturals.
In Chia’s experiments, professional
musicians learn about two pianists
whose biographies are identical in terms
of prior achievements.
The subjects
listen to a short clip of these individuals
playing piano; unbeknownst to the
listeners, a single pianist is, in fact,
playing different parts of the same piece.
What varies is that one pianist is
described as a “natural” with early
evidence of innate talent. The other is
described as a “striver” with early
evidence of high motivation and
perseverance. In direct contradiction to
their stated beliefs about the importance
of effort versus talent, musicians judge
the natural to be
more likely to succeed
and more hirable.
As a follow-up study, Chia tested
whether this same inconsistency would
be evident in a very different domain
where hard work and striving are
celebrated: entrepreneurship. She
recruited hundreds of adults with
varying levels of experience in business
and randomly divided them into two
groups. Half of her research subjects
read the profile of a “striver”
entrepreneur, described as having
achieved success through hard work,
effort, and experience. The other half
read the profile of a “natural”
entrepreneur, described as having
achieved success through innate ability.
All participants listened to the same
audio recording of a business proposal
and were told the recording was made
by the specific entrepreneur they’d read
about.
As in her study of musicians, Chia
found that
naturals were rated higher for
likelihood of success and being hirable,
and that their business proposals were
judged superior in quality. In a related
study, Chia found that when people were
forced to choose between backing one of
two entrepreneurs—one identified as a
striver, the other a natural—they tended
to
favor the natural. In fact, the point of
indifference between a striver and a
natural was only reached when the
striver had four more years of leadership
experience and $40,000 more in start-up
capital.
Chia’s research pulls back the curtain
on our ambivalence toward talent and
effort. What we
say
 we care about may
not correspond with what—deep down
—we actually
believe
 to be more
valuable. It’s a little like saying we
don’t care at all about physical
attractiveness in a romantic
partner and
then, when it comes to actually choosing
whom to date, picking the cute guy over
the nice one.
The “naturalness bias” is a hidden
prejudice against those who’ve achieved
what they have because they worked for
it, and a hidden preference for those
whom we think arrived at their place in
life because they’re naturally talented.
We may not admit to others this bias for
naturals; we may not even admit it to
ourselves. But the bias is evident in the
choices we make.
Chia’s own life is an interesting example
of the natural versus striver
phenomenon. Now a professor at
University College London, she
publishes her scholarly work in the most
prestigious of academic journals. As a
child, she attended classes at Juilliard,
whose pre-college program invites
students “who exhibit the talent,
potential, and accomplishment to pursue
a career in music” to experience “an
atmosphere where artistic gifts and
technical skills can flourish.”
Chia holds several degrees from
Harvard. Her first was a bachelor’s
degree in psychology; she graduated
magna cum laude with highest honors.
She also has two master’s degrees: one
in the history of science and the other in
social psychology. And, finally, while
completing her PhD in organizational
behavior and psychology at Harvard, she
also picked up a secondary PhD in
music.
Impressed? If not, let me add that
Chia also has degrees from the Peabody
Conservatory in piano performance and
pedagogy—and yes, she’s performed at
Carnegie Hall, not to mention Lincoln
Center, the Kennedy Center, and at the
palace recital commemorating the
presidency of the European Union.
If you only saw her credentials, you
might leap to the conclusion that Chia
was born more gifted than anyone you
know: “My god! What an extraordinarily
talented young woman!” And, if Chia’s
research is right, that explanation would
embellish her accomplishments with
more luster, more mystery, and more
awe than the alternative: “My god! What
an extraordinarily dedicated,
hardworking young woman!”
And then what would happen?
There’s a vast amount of research on
what happens when we believe a student
is especially talented. We begin to lavish
extra attention on them and hold them to
higher expectations. We expect them to
excel, and that expectation becomes
a
self-fulfilling prophecy.
I’ve asked Chia what she makes of
her own musical accomplishments.
“Well, I guess I may have some talent,”
Chia said. “But I think, more than that, I
loved music so much I practiced four to
six hours a day all throughout
childhood.” And in college, despite a
punishing schedule of classes and
activities, she made time to practice
almost as much. So, yes, she has some
talent—but she’s a striver, too.
Why did Chia practice so much? I
wondered. Was it forced on her? Did she
have any choice in the matter?
“Oh, it was
me
. It was what I wanted.
I wanted to get better and better and
better. When I practiced piano, I
pictured myself onstage in front of a
crowded audience. I imagined them
clapping.”
The year I left McKinsey for teaching,
three of the firm’s partners published a
report called “
The War for Talent.” The
report was widely read and eventually
became a best-selling book. The basic
argument was that companies in the
modern economy rise and fall depending
on their ability to attract and retain “A
players.”
“
What do we mean by
talent
?” the
McKinsey authors ask in the book’s
opening pages. Answering their own
question: “In the most general sense,
talent is the sum of a person’s abilities—
his or her intrinsic gifts, skills,
knowledge, experience, intelligence,
judgment, attitude, character, and drive.
It also includes his or her ability to learn
and grow.” That’s a long list, and it
reveals the struggle most of us have
when we try to define talent with any
precision. But it doesn’t surprise me that
“intrinsic gifts” are mentioned first.
When
Fortune
 magazine put
McKinsey on its cover, the lead article
began: “When in the presence of a young
McKinsey partner, one gets the distinct
impression that if plied with a cocktail
or two, he might well lean across the
table and suggest something awkward,
like comparing SAT scores.” It’s almost
impossible, the journalist observed, to
overestimate “the premium placed
within the McKinsey culture on analytic
ability, or as its denizens say,
on being
‘bright.’ ”
McKinsey is famous for recruiting
and rewarding smart men and women—
some with MBAs from places like
Harvard and Stanford, and the rest, like
me, who possess some other credential
that suggests we must have very big
brains.
My interviews with McKinsey
unfolded as most do, with a series of
brainteasers designed to test my analytic
mettle. One interviewer sat me down
and introduced himself, then asked:
“How many tennis balls are
manufactured in the United States per
year?”
“I guess there are two ways to
approach that question,” I responded.
“The first way is to find the right person,
or maybe trade organization, to tell you.”
My interviewer nodded, but gave me a
look that said he wanted the other kind
of answer.
“Or you could take some basic
assumptions and do some multiplying to
figure it out.”
My interviewer smiled broadly. So I
gave him what he wanted.
“Okay, assume there are about two
hundred fifty million people in the
United States. Let’s say the most active
tennis players are between the age of ten
and thirty. That’s got to be, roughly
speaking, one-fourth of the population. I
guess that gives you a little over sixty
million potential tennis players.”
Now my interviewer was really
excited. I continued the logic game,
multiplying and dividing by numbers
according to my completely uninformed
estimates of how many people actually
play tennis, and
how often they play on
average, and how many balls they would
use in a game, and then how often they
would need to replace dead or lost ones.
I got to some number, which was
probably wildly off, because at every
step I was making another uninformed
assumption that was, to some degree or
another, incorrect. Finally, I said: “The
math here isn’t that hard for me. I’m
tutoring a little girl who is practicing her
fractions right now, and we do a lot of
mental math together. But if you want to
know what I’d
really
 do if I needed to
know the answer to that question, I’ll tell
you: I’d just call someone who actually
knows.”
More smiling, and then an assurance
that he’d learned all he needed to from
our interaction. And also from my
application—including my SAT scores,
which McKinsey heavily relies on to do
their early sorting of candidates. In other
words, if the advice to corporate
America is to create a culture that values
talent above all else, McKinsey
practices what it preaches.
Once I accepted the offer to join the
New York City office, I was told that my
first month would be spent in a fancy
hotel in Clearwater, Florida. There I
joined about three dozen other new hires
who, like me, lacked any training in
business. Instead, each of us had earned
some other academic badge of honor. I
sat next to a guy with a PhD in physics,
for example. On my other side was a
surgeon, and behind me were two
lawyers.
None of us knew much about
management in general, or about any
industry in particular. But that was about
to change: in a single month, we would
complete a crash course called the
“mini-MBA.” Since we were all vetted
to be superfast learners, there was no
question that we would successfully
master a massive amount of information
in a very short amount of time.
Newly equipped with a casual
acquaintance with cash flow, the
difference
between revenue and profit,
and some other rudimentary facts about
what I now knew to call “the private
sector,” we were shipped off to our
designated offices around the world,
where we would join teams of other
consultants and be matched up with
corporate clients to solve whatever
problems they threw our way.
I soon learned that McKinsey’s basic
business proposition is straightforward.
For a very large sum of money per
month, companies can hire a McKinsey
team to solve problems too thorny to be
solved by the folks who are already
working on them. At the end of this
“engagement,” as it was called in the
firm, we were supposed to produce a
report that was dramatically more
insightful than anything they could have
generated in-house.
It occurred to me, as I was putting
together slides summarizing bold,
sweeping recommendations for a
multibillion-dollar medical products
conglomerate, that, really, I had no idea
what I was talking about. There were
senior consultants on the team who may
have known more, but there were also
more junior consultants who, having just
graduated from college, surely knew
even less.
Why hire us, then, at such an
exorbitant cost? Well, for one thing, we
had the advantage of an outsider’s
perspective untainted by insider politics.
We also had a method for solving
business problems that was hypothesis
and data driven. There were probably
lots of good reasons CEOs brought in
McKinsey. But among them, I think, was
that we were supposed to be sharper
than the people who were already on-
site. Hiring McKinsey meant hiring the
very “best and brightest”—as if being
the brightest also made us the best.
According to
The War for Talent
, the
companies that excel are those that
aggressively promote the most talented
employees while just as aggressively
culling the least talented. In such
companies, huge disparities in salary are
not only justified but desirable. Why?
Because a
competitive, winner-take-all
environment encourages the
most
talented to stick around and the
least
talented to find alternative employment.
Duff McDonald, the journalist who’s
done the most in-depth research on
McKinsey to date, has suggested that this
particular business philosophy would be
more aptly titled
The War on Common
Sense
. McDonald points out that the
companies highlighted in the original
McKinsey report as exemplars of their
endorsed strategy didn’t do so well in
the years after that report was published.
Journalist Malcolm
Gladwell has
also critiqued the
The War for Talent
.
Enron, he points out, epitomized the
“talent mindset” approach to
management advocated by McKinsey. As
we all know, the Enron story doesn’t
have a happy ending. Once one of the
largest energy trading companies in the
world, Enron was named America’s
Most Innovative Company by
Fortune
magazine six years in a row. Yet, by the
end of 2001, when the business filed for
bankruptcy, it had become clear that the
company’s extraordinary profits were
attributable to massive and systematic
accounting fraud. When Enron
collapsed, thousands of its employees,
who had no hand at all in the
wrongdoing, lost their jobs, health
insurance, and retirement savings. At the
time, it was the
largest corporate
bankruptcy in U.S. history.
You can’t blame the Enron debacle on
a surfeit of IQ points. You can’t blame it
on a lack of grit, either. But Gladwell
argues convincingly that demanding
Enron employees prove that they were
smarter than everyone else inadvertently
contributed to a narcissistic culture, with
an overrepresentation of employees who
were both incredibly smug and driven by
deep insecurity to keep showing off. It
was a culture that encouraged short-term
performance but discouraged long-term
learning and growth.
The same point comes through in the
postmortem documentary on Enron
called, appropriately enough,
The
Smartest Guys in the Room
. During the
company’s ascendency, it was a brash
and brilliant former McKinsey
consultant named Jeff Skilling who was
Enron’s CEO. Skilling
developed a
performance review system for Enron
that consisted of grading employees
annually and summarily
firing the bottom
15 percent. In other words, no matter
what your absolute level of
performance, if you were weak, relative
to others, you got fired. Inside Enron,
this practice was known as “rank-and-
yank.” Skilling considered it one of the
most important strategies his company
had. But ultimately, it may have
contributed to a work environment that
rewarded deception and discouraged
integrity.
Is talent a bad thing? Are we all equally
talented? No and no. The ability to
quickly climb the learning curve of any
skill is obviously a very good thing, and,
like it or not, some of us are better at it
than others.
So why, then, is it such a bad thing to
favor “naturals” over “strivers”? What’s
the downside of television shows like
America’s Got Talent
,
The X Factor
,
and
Child Genius
? Why shouldn’t we
separate children as young as seven or
eight into two groups: those few children
who are “gifted and talented” and the
many, many more who aren’t? What
harm is there, really, in a talent show
being named a “talent show”?
In my view, the biggest reason a
preoccupation with talent can be harmful
is simple: By shining our spotlight on
talent, we risk leaving everything else in
the shadows. We inadvertently send the
message that these other factors—
including grit—don’t matter as much as
they really do.
Consider, for example, the story of
Scott Barry Kaufman. Scott’s office is
just two doors down from mine, and he’s
a lot like the other academic
psychologists I know: He spends most of
his waking hours reading, thinking,
collecting data, doing statistics, and
writing. He publishes his research in
scientific journals. He knows a lot of
polysyllabic words. He has degrees
from Carnegie Mellon, Cambridge
University, and Yale. He plays the cello
for fun
.
But as a child, Scott was considered
a slow learner—which was true.
“Basically, I got a lot of ear infections as
a kid,” Scott explains. “And that led to
this problem with processing
information from sound in real time. I
was
always a step or two behind the
other kids in my class.” So halting was
his academic progress, in fact, that he
was placed in special education classes.
He repeated third grade. Around the
same time, he met with a school
psychologist to take an IQ test. In an
anxiety-ridden test session he describes
as “harrowing,” Scott performed so
poorly that he was sent to a special
school for children with learning
disabilities.
It was not until age fourteen that an
observant special education teacher took
Scott aside and asked why he wasn’t in
more challenging classes. Until then,
Scott had never questioned his
intellectual status. Instead, he’d assumed
that his lack of talent would put a very
low ceiling on what he might do with his
life.
Meeting a teacher who believed in
his potential was a critical turning point:
a pivot from
This is all you can do
 to
Who knows what you can do?
 At that
moment, Scott started wondering, for the
very first time:
Who am I? Am I a
learning disabled kid with no real
future? Or maybe something else?
And then, to find out, Scott signed up
for just about every challenge his school
had to offer. Latin class. The school
musical. Choir. He didn’t necessarily
excel in everything, but he
learned
 in
all. What Scott learned is that he wasn’t
hopeless.
Something that Scott found he
did
learn fairly easily was the cello. His
grandfather had been a cellist in the
Philadelphia Orchestra for nearly fifty
years, and Scott had the idea that his
grandfather could give him lessons. He
did, and the summer that Scott first
picked up the cello, he began practicing
eight or nine hours a day. He was
fiercely determined to improve, and not
only because he enjoyed the cello:
“I
was so driven to just show someone,
anyone, that I was intellectually capable
of anything. At this point I didn’t even
care what it was.”
Improve he did, and by the fall, he
earned a seat in his high school
orchestra. If the story ended there and
then, it might not be about grit. But
here’s what happened next. Scott kept up
—and even increased—his practicing.
He skipped lunch to practice. Sometimes
he skipped classes to practice. By senior
year, he was second chair—he was the
second-best cellist in the orchestra—and
he was in the choir, too, and winning all
kinds of awards from the music
department.
He also started doing well in his
classes, many of which were now
honors classes. Almost all of his friends
were in the gifted and talented program,
and Scott wanted to join them. He
wanted to talk about Plato and do mental
puzzles and learn more than he was
already learning. Of course, with his IQ
scores from childhood, there was no
such possibility. He remembers the
school psychologist drawing a bell-
shaped curve on the back of a napkin and
pointing to its peak—“This is
average”—then moving to the right
—“This is where you’d have to be for
gifted and talented classes”—and then
moving to the left—“And this is where
you are.”
“At what point,” Scott asked,
“does
achievement trump potential?”
The school psychologist shook his
head and showed Scott the door.
That fall, Scott decided he wanted to
study this thing called “intelligence” and
come to his own conclusions. He
applied to the cognitive science program
at Carnegie Mellon University. And he
was rejected. The rejection letter did not
specify why, of course, but given his
stellar grades and extracurricular
accomplishments, Scott could only
conclude that the impediment was his
low SAT scores.
“I had this grit,” Scott recalls. “I said,
‘I’m going to do it. I don’t care. I’m
going to find a way to study what I want
to study.’ ” And then Scott auditioned for
Carnegie Mellon’s opera program. Why?
Because the opera program didn’t look
very hard at SAT scores, focusing
instead on musical aptitude and
expression. In his first year, Scott took a
psychology course as an elective. Soon
after, he added psychology as a minor.
Next, he transferred his major from
opera to psychology. And then he
graduated Phi Beta Kappa.
Like Scott, I took an IQ test early in my
schooling and was
deemed insufficiently
bright to benefit from gifted and talented
classes. For whatever reason—maybe a
teacher asked that I be retested—I was
evaluated again the following year, and I
made the cut. I guess you could say I was
borderline gifted.
One way to interpret these stories is
that talent is great, but
tests
 of talent
stink. There’s certainly an argument to
be made that tests of talent—and tests of
anything else psychologists study,
including grit—are highly imperfect.
But another conclusion is that the
focus on talent distracts us from
something that is at least as important,
and that is effort. In the next chapter, I’ll
argue that, as much as talent counts,
effort counts twice.

Chapter 3
# Effort Counts
# Twice
Not a day goes by that I don’t read or
hear the word
talent
. In every section of
the newspaper—from the sports page to
the business section, from profiles of
actors and musicians in the weekend
supplement, to front-page stories of
rising stars in politics—allusions to
talent abound. It seems that when anyone
accomplishes a feat worth writing about,
we rush to anoint that individual as
extraordinarily “talented.”
If we overemphasize talent, we
underemphasize everything else. In the
extreme, it’s as if, deep down, we hold
the following to be true:
For instance, I recently listened to a
radio commentator draw a comparison
between Hillary and Bill Clinton. He
observed that both are unusually good
communicators. But while her husband,
Bill, is a gifted politician, Hillary has to
contort herself into the role. Bill is a
natural; Hillary merely a striver. The
unsaid but obvious implication is that
she’ll never quite be his equal.
I’ve caught myself doing it, too. When
someone really, really impresses me, I
might reflexively say to myself:
What a
genius!
 I should know better. I do. So
what’s going on? Why does an
unconscious bias toward talent persist?
A few years ago, I read a study of
competitive swimmers titled
“The
Mundanity of Excellence.” The title of
the article encapsulates its major
conclusion: the most dazzling human
achievements are, in fact, the aggregate
of countless individual elements, each of
which is, in a sense, ordinary.
Dan Chambliss, the sociologist who
completed the study, observed:
“Superlative performance is really a
confluence of
dozens of small skills or
activities, each one learned or stumbled
upon, which have been carefully drilled
into habit and then are fitted together in a
synthesized whole. There is nothing
extraordinary or superhuman in any one
of those actions; only the fact that they
are done consistently and correctly, and
all together, produce excellence.”
But mundanity is a hard sell. When
finishing up his analyses, Dan shared a
few chapters with a colleague. “
You
need to jazz it up,” his friend said. “You
need to make these people more
interesting. . . .”
When I called Dan to probe a few of
his observations, I learned that he’d
become fascinated with the idea of talent
—and what we really mean by it—as a
swimmer himself and, for several years
afterward, as a part-time coach. As a
young assistant professor, Dan decided
to do an in-depth, qualitative study of
swimmers. In total, Dan devoted six
years to interviewing, watching, and
sometimes living and traveling with
swimmers and coaches at all levels—
from the local swim club to an elite team
made up of future Olympians.
“Talent,” he observed, “is perhaps
the most pervasive lay explanation
we
have for athletic success.” It is as if
talent were some invisible “substance
behind the surface reality of
performance, which finally
distinguishes
the best among our athletes.” And these
great athletes seem blessed “with a
special gift, almost a ‘thing’ inside of
them, denied to the rest of us—perhaps
physical, genetic, psychological, or
physiological. Some have ‘it,’ and some
don’t. Some are ‘natural athletes,’ and
some aren’t.”
I think Dan is exactly right. If we
can’t explain how an athlete, musician,
or anyone else has done something jaw-
droppingly amazing, we’re inclined to
throw up our hands and say, “It’s a gift!
Nobody can teach you that.” In other
words, when we can’t easily see how
experience and training got someone to a
level of excellence that is so clearly
beyond the norm, we default to labeling
that person a “natural.”
Dan points out that the biographies of
great swimmers reveal many, many
factors that contribute to their ultimate
success. For instance, the most
accomplished swimmers almost
invariably had parents who were
interested in the sport and earned enough
money to pay for coaching, travel to
swim meets, and not the least important:
access to a pool. And, crucially, there
were the thousands of hours of practice
in the pool over years and years—all
spent refining the many individual
elements whose sum create a single
flawless performance.
Though it seems wrong to assume that
talent is a complete explanation for
dazzling performance, it’s also
understandable.
“It’s easy to do,” Dan
explained, “especially if one’s only
exposure to top athletes comes once
every four years while watching the
Olympics on television, or if one only
sees them in performances rather than in
day-to-day training.”
Another point he makes is that the
minimal talent needed to succeed in
swimming is lower than most of us think.
“I don’t think you mean to say that any
of us could be Michael Phelps,” I said.
“
Do
 you?”
“No, of course not,” Dan replied. “To
begin with, there are certain
anatomical
advantages that you really can’t train
for.”
“And,” I continued, “wouldn’t you
say that some swimmers improve more
than others, even if they’re trying equally
hard and getting the same coaching?”
“Yes, but the main thing is that
greatness is doable. Greatness is many,
many individual feats, and each of them
is doable.”
Dan’s point is that if you had a time-
lapse film of the hours and days and
weeks and years that produced
excellence, you could see what he saw:
that a high level of performance is, in
fact, an accretion of mundane acts. But
does the incremental mastery of mundane
individual components explain
everything? I wondered. Is that all there
is?
“Well, we all love mystery and
magic,” he said. “I do, too.”
Then Dan told me about the day he
got to watch Rowdy Gaines and Mark
Spitz swim laps. “Spitz won seven gold
medals in the ’72 Olympics and was the
big thing before Michael Phelps,” he
explained. “In ’84, twelve years after
retirement, Spitz showed up. He’s in his
mid-thirties. And he gets into the water
with Rowdy Gaines, who at that time
held the world record in the one hundred
free. They did some fifties—in other
words, two lengths of the pool, just
sprints, like little races. Gaines won
most of them, but by the time they were
halfway through, the entire team was
standing around the edge of the pool just
to watch Spitz swim.”
Everyone on the team had been
training with Gaines, and they knew how
good he was. They knew he was favored
to win Olympic gold. But because of the
age gap, nobody had swum with Spitz.
One swimmer turned to Dan and said,
pointing to Spitz, “My god. He’s a fish.”
I could hear the wonder in Dan’s
voice. Even a student of mundanity, it
seems, is easily lulled into talent
explanations. I pressed him a bit. Was
that sort of majestic performance
something divine?
Dan told me to go read Nietzsche.
Nietzsche? The
philosopher
? What
would a nineteenth-century
German
philosopher have to say that might
explain Mark Spitz? As it turns out,
Nietzsche, too, had thought long and hard
about the same questions.
“With everything perfect,” Nietzsche
wrote, “we do not ask
how it came to
be.” Instead, “we rejoice in the present
fact as though it came
out of the ground
by magic.”
When I read that passage, I thought of
the young swimmers watching their icon
Spitz exhibit form that almost didn’t
seem human.
“No one can see in the work of the
artist how it has
become
,” Nietzsche
said. “That is its advantage, for
wherever one can see the act of
becoming one
grows somewhat cool.” In
other words, we
want
 to believe that
Mark Spitz was born to swim in a way
that none of us were and that none of us
could. We don’t want to sit on the pool
deck and watch him progress from
amateur to expert. We prefer our
excellence fully formed. We prefer
mystery to mundanity.
But why? What’s the reason for
fooling ourselves into thinking Mark
Spitz didn’t
earn
 his mastery?
“Our vanity, our self-love, promotes
the cult of the genius,” Nietzsche said.
“For if we think of genius as something
magical, we are not obliged to compare
ourselves and find ourselves lacking. . . .
To call someone ‘divine’ means: ‘here
there is no need to compete.’ ”
In other words, mythologizing natural
talent lets us all off the hook. It lets us
relax into the status quo. That’s what
undoubtedly occurred in my early days
of teaching when I mistakenly equated
talent and achievement, and by doing so,
removed effort—both my students’ and
my own—from further consideration.
So what is the reality of greatness?
Nietzsche came to the same conclusion
Dan Chambliss did. Great things are
accomplished by those “people whose
thinking is
active in
one
 direction, who
employ everything
as material, who
always zealously observe their own
inner life and that of others, who
perceive everywhere models and
incentives, who never tire of combining
together the means available to them.”
And what about talent? Nietzsche
implored us to consider exemplars to be,
above all else, craftsmen: “Do not talk
about
giftedness, inborn talents! One can
name great men of all kinds who were
very little gifted. They
acquired
greatness, became ‘geniuses’ (as we put
it). . . . They all possessed that
seriousness of the efficient workman
which first learns to construct the parts
properly before it ventures to fashion a
great whole; they allowed themselves
time for it, because they took more
pleasure in making the little, secondary
things well than in the effect of a
dazzling whole.”
In my second year of graduate school, I
sat down to a weekly meeting with my
advisor, Marty Seligman. I was more
than a little nervous. Marty has that
effect on people, especially his students.
Then in his sixties, Marty had won
just about every accolade psychology
has to offer. His early research led to an
unprecedented understanding of clinical
depression. More recently, as president
of the American Psychological
Association, he christened the field of
Positive Psychology, a discipline that
applies the scientific method to
questions of
human flourishing.
Marty is barrel-chested and baritone-
voiced. He may study happiness and
well-being, but
cheerful
 is not a word
I’d use to describe him.
In the middle of whatever it was I
was saying—a report on what I’d done
in the past week, I suppose, or the next
steps in one of our research studies—
Marty interrupted. “You haven’t had a
good idea in two years.”
I stared at him, openmouthed, trying
to process what he’d just said. Then I
blinked. Two years? I hadn’t even been
in graduate school for two years!
Silence.
Then he crossed his arms, frowned,
and said: “You can do all kinds of fancy
statistics. You somehow get every parent
in a school to return their consent form.
You’ve made a few insightful
observations. But you don’t have a
theory. You don’t have a theory for the
psychology of achievement.”
Silence.
“What’s a theory?” I finally asked,
having absolutely no clue as to what he
was talking about.
Silence.
“Stop reading so much and go think.”
I left his office, went into mine, and
cried. At home with my husband, I cried
more. I cursed Marty under my breath—
and aloud as well—for being such a
jerk. Why was he telling me what I was
doing wrong? Why wasn’t he praising
me for what I was doing right?
You don’t have a theory. . . .
Those words rattled around in my
mind for days. Finally, I dried my tears,
stopped my cursing, and sat down at my
computer. I opened the word processor
and stared at the blinking cursor,
realizing I hadn’t gotten far beyond the
basic observation that talent was not
enough to succeed in life. I hadn’t
worked out how, exactly, talent and
effort and skill and achievement all fit
together.
A theory is an explanation. A theory
takes a blizzard of facts and
observations and explains, in the most
basic terms, what the heck is going on.
By necessity, a theory is incomplete. It
oversimplifies. But in doing so, it helps
us understand.
If talent falls short of explaining
achievement, what’s missing?
I have been working on a theory of
the psychology of achievement since
Marty scolded me for not having one. I
have pages and pages of diagrams,
filling more than a dozen lab notebooks.
After more than a
decade of thinking
about it, sometimes alone, and
sometimes in partnership with close
colleagues, I finally published an article
in which I lay down two simple
equations that explain how you get from
talent to achievement.
Here they are:
Talent is how quickly your skills
improve when you invest effort.
Achievement is what happens when you
take your acquired skills and use them.
Of course, your opportunities—for
example, having a great coach or teacher
—matter tremendously, too, and maybe
more than anything about the individual.
My theory doesn’t address these outside
forces, nor does it include luck. It’s
about the psychology of achievement, but
because psychology isn’t all that matters,
it’s incomplete.
Still, I think it’s useful. What this
theory says is that when you consider
individuals in identical circumstances,
what each achieves depends on just two
things, talent and effort. Talent—how
fast we improve in skill—absolutely
matters. But effort factors into the
calculations
twice
, not once. Effort
builds skill. At the very same time, effort
makes skill
productive
. Let me give you
a few examples.
There’s a celebrated potter named
Warren MacKenzie who lives in
Minnesota. Now ninety-two years old,
he has been at his craft, without
interruption, for nearly his entire adult
life. Early on, he and his
late wife, also
an artist, tried a lot of different things:
“You know, when you’re young, you
think you can do anything, and we
thought, oh, we’ll be potters, we’ll be
painters, we’ll be textile designers,
we’ll be jewelers, we’ll be a little of
this, a little of that. We were
going to be
the renaissance people.”
It soon became clear that doing one
thing better and better might be more
satisfying than staying an amateur at
many different things: “Eventually both
of us gave up the drawing and painting,
gave up the silk-screening, gave up the
textile design, and concentrated on
ceramic work, because that was where
we felt
our true interest lay.”
MacKenzie told me “a good potter
can make
forty or fifty pots in a day.”
Out of these, “some of them are good
and some of them are mediocre and
some of them are bad.” Only a few will
be worth selling, and of those, even
fewer “will
continue to engage the
senses after daily use.”
Of course, it’s not just the number of
good pots MacKenzie makes that has
brought the art world to his door. It’s the
beauty and form of the pots: “I’m
striving to make things which are
the
most exciting things I can make that will
fit in people’s homes.” Still, as a
simplification, you might say that the
number of enduringly beautiful,
exquisitely useful pots MacKenzie is
able to produce, in total, will be what he
accomplishes as an artist. It would not
satisfy him to be among the most
masterful potters but only produce, say,
one or two pieces in his lifetime.
MacKenzie still throws clay on the
wheel every day, and with effort his skill
has improved: “I think back to some of
the pots we made when we first started
our pottery, and they were pretty awful
pots. We thought at the time they were
good; they were the best we could make,
but our thinking was so elemental that
the pots had that quality also, and so they
don’t have a richness about them which I
look for
in my work today.”
“The
first 10,000 pots are difficult,”
he has said, “and then it gets a little bit
easier.”
As things got easier, and as
MacKenzie improved, he produced more
good pots a day:
talent x

effort

= skill
At the same time, the number of good
pots he’s brought into the world
increased:
skill x

effort

=
skill x

effort

=
achievement
With effort, MacKenzie has gotten
better and better at making “the most
exciting things I can make that will fit in
people’s homes.” At the same time, with
the same invested effort, he has become
more accomplished.
“
Garp was a natural storyteller.”
This is a line from John Irving’s
fourth novel,
The World According to
Garp
. Like that novel’s fictional
protagonist, Irving tells a great story. He
has been lauded as “
the great storyteller
of American literature today.” To date,
he’s written more than a dozen novels,
most of which have been best sellers and
half of which have been made into
movies.
The World According to Garp
won the National Book Award, and
Irving’s screenplay for
The Cider House
Rules
 won an Academy Award.
But unlike Garp, Irving was not a
natural. While
Garp “could make things
up, one right after the other, and they
seemed to fit,” Irving rewrites draft after
draft of his novels. Of his early attempts
at writing, Irving has said, “Most of all,
I rewrote everything . . . I began to take
my lack of talent seriously.”
Irving recalls earning a C– in high
school English. His
SAT verbal score
was 475 out of 800, which means almost
two-thirds of the students who took the
SAT did better than him. He needed to
stay in high
school an extra year to have
enough credits to graduate. Irving recalls
that his teachers thought he was both
“lazy” and “stupid.”
Irving was neither lazy nor stupid.
But he was severely dyslexic: “I was an
underdog. . . . If my classmates could
read our history assignment in an hour, I
allowed myself two or three. If I
couldn’t learn to spell, I would keep a
list of my most
frequently misspelled
words.” When his own son was
diagnosed with dyslexia, Irving finally
understood why he, himself, had been
such a poor student. Irving’s son read
noticeably slower than his classmates,
“with his finger following the sentence
—as I read, as I
still
 read. Unless I’ve
written it, I read whatever ‘it’ is very
slowly—and with my finger.”
Since reading and writing didn’t
come easily, Irving learned that “to do
anything really well,
you have to
overextend yourself. . . . In my case, I
learned that I just had to pay twice as
much attention. I came to appreciate that
in doing something over and over again,
something that was never natural
becomes almost second nature. You
learn that you have the capacity for that,
and that it doesn’t come overnight.”
Do the precociously talented learn
that lesson? Do they discover that the
capacity to do something over and over
again, to struggle, to have patience, can
be mastered—but not overnight?
Some might. But those who struggle
early may learn it better: “One reason I
have confidence in writing the kind of
novels I write,” Irving said, “is that I
have confidence in my stamina to go
over something again and again
no
matter how difficult it is.” After his tenth
novel, Irving observed,
“Rewriting is
what I do best as a writer. I spend more
time revising a novel or screenplay than
I take to write the first draft.”
“It’s become an advantage,” Irving
has observed of his inability to read and
spell as fluently as others. “In writing a
novel, it doesn’t hurt anybody
to have to
go slowly. It doesn’t hurt anyone as a
writer to have to go over something
again and again.”
With daily effort, Irving became one
of the most masterful and prolific
writers in history. With effort, he became
a master, and with effort, his mastery
produced stories that have touched
millions of people, including me.
Grammy Award–winning musician and
Oscar-nominated actor Will Smith has
thought a lot about talent, effort, skill,
and achievement. “I’ve never really
viewed myself as particularly talented,”
he once observed. “Where I excel is
ridiculous,
sickening work ethic.”
Accomplishment, in Will’s eyes, is
very much about going the distance.
Asked to explain his ascendancy to the
entertainment elite, Will said:
The only thing that I see that is
distinctly different about me is:
I’m not afraid to die on a
treadmill. I will not be outworked,
period. You might have more
talent than me, you might be
smarter than me, you might be
sexier than me. You might be all of
those things. You got it on me in
nine categories. But if we get on
the treadmill together, there’s two
things: You’re getting off first,
or
I’m going to die. It’s really that
simple.
In 1940, researchers at Harvard
University had the same idea. In a study
designed to understand the
“characteristics of
healthy young men” in
order to “help people live happier, more
successful lives,” 130 sophomores were
asked to run on a treadmill for up to five
minutes. The treadmill was set at such a
steep angle and cranked up to such a fast
speed that the average man held on
for
only four minutes. Some lasted for only a
minute and a half.
By design, the Treadmill Test was
exhausting. Not just physically but
mentally. By measuring and then
adjusting for baseline physical fitness,
the researchers designed the Treadmill
Test to gauge “stamina
and
strength of
will.” In particular, Harvard researchers
knew that running hard was not just a
function of aerobic capacity and muscle
strength but also the extent to which “a
subject is willing to push himself or has
a tendency to quit before the punishment
becomes too severe.”
Decades later, a psychiatrist named
George Vaillant followed up on the
young men in the original Treadmill Test.
Then in their sixties, these men had been
contacted by researchers every two
years since graduating from college, and
for each there was a corresponding file
folder at Harvard literally bursting with
questionnaires, correspondence, and
notes from in-depth interviews. For
instance, researchers noted for each man
his income, career advancement, sick
days, social activities, self-reported
satisfaction with work and marriage,
visits to psychiatrists, and use of mood-
altering drugs like tranquilizers. All this
information went into composite
estimates of the men’s overall
psychological adjustment in adulthood.
It turns out that run time in the
Treadmill Test at age twenty was a
surprisingly reliable predictor of
psychological adjustment throughout
adulthood. George and his team
considered that staying on the treadmill
was also a function of how physically fit
these men were in their youth, and that
this finding merely indicated that
physical health predicted later
psychological well-being. However,
they found that adjusting for baseline
physical fitness “had little effect on the
correlation of running time
with mental
health.”
In other words, Will Smith is on to
something. When it comes to how we
fare in the marathon of life, effort counts
tremendously.
“How long would
you
 have stayed on
the treadmill?” I asked George recently.
I wanted to know because, in my eyes,
George is himself a paragon of grit.
Early in his career, not long after
completing his residency in psychiatry,
George discovered the treadmill data,
along with all the other information on
the men collected to that point. Like a
baton, the study had been handed from
one research team to another, with
dwindling interest and energy. Until it
got to him.
George revived the study. He
reestablished contact with the men by
mail and phone and, in addition,
interviewed each in person, traveling to
all corners of the world to do so. Now
in his eighties, George has outlived most
of the men in the original study. He is
currently writing his fourth book on what
is by now the longest continuous study of
human development ever undertaken.
In answer to my question about his
own treadmill perseverance, George
replied, “Oh,
I’m not all that persistent.
When I do crossword puzzles on the
airplane, I always look at the answers
when I am a little bit frustrated.”
So, not very gritty when it comes to
crossword puzzles.
“And when something is broken in the
house, I turn it over to my wife, and she
fixes it.”
“So you don’t think you’re gritty?” I
asked.
“The reason why the Harvard study
works is that I have been doing it
constantly and persistently. It’s the one
ball I’ve kept my eye on. Because I’m
totally fascinated by it. There is nothing
more interesting than watching people
grow.”
And then, after a short pause, George
recalled his days at prep school, where,
as a varsity track athlete, he competed in
pole vaulting. To improve, he and the
other vaulters did pull-ups, which he
calls “chins,” because you start by
hanging off a bar and then pull yourself
up to where your chin hovers just above,
then you drop down again, and repeat.
“I could do more chins than anyone.
And it wasn’t because I was very
athletic—I wasn’t. The reason is that I
did
 a lot of chin-ups. I practiced.”
The prolific writer and director Woody
Allen, when asked about his advice for
young artists, once said:
My observation was that once a
person actually completed a play
or a novel he was well on his way
to getting it produced or
published, as opposed to a vast
majority of people who tell me
their ambition is to write, but who
strike out on the very first level
and indeed
never write the play or
book.
Or, in Allen’s snappier formulation,
“Eighty percent of success in life is
showing up.”
Back in the 1980s, both George H. W.
Bush and Mario Cuomo frequently
repeated this bit of wisdom in speech
after speech, turning the saying into
something of a meme. So, while these
leaders of the Republican and
Democratic parties must have disagreed
on a great many things, they were in
complete consensus on the importance of
following through on what one has
started.
I told George Vaillant that, if I’d been
on the Harvard research team in 1940, I
would have made a suggestion. I would
have allowed the young men to
come
back the next day, if they wanted, and try
the Treadmill Test again. I suspect that
some would have come back to see if
they could stay on longer, whereas
others would have been content with
their first timed effort. Maybe some
would ask the researchers whether they
knew of any strategies, physical or
mental, in order to last longer. And
maybe these fellows would even be
interested in a third try, and a fourth. . . .
Then I would create a grit score based
on how many times men voluntarily
returned to see if they could improve.
Staying on the treadmill is one thing,
and I do think it’s related to staying true
to our commitments even when we’re
not comfortable. But getting back on the
treadmill the next day, eager to try again,
is in my view even more reflective of
grit. Because when you don’t come back
the next day—when you permanently
turn your back on a commitment—your
effort plummets to zero. As a
consequence, your skills stop improving,
and at the same time, you stop producing
anything with whatever skills you have.
The treadmill is, in fact, an
appropriate metaphor. By some
estimates, about 40 percent of people
who buy home exercise equipment later
say they ended up using it
less than
they’d expected. How hard we push
ourselves in a given workout matters, of
course, but I think the bigger impediment
to progress is that sometimes we stop
working out altogether. As any coach or
athlete will tell you, consistency of
effort over the long run is everything.
How often do people start down a
path and then give up on it entirely?
How many treadmills, exercise bikes,
and weight sets are at this very moment
gathering dust in basements across the
country? How many kids go out for a
sport and then quit even before the
season is over? How many of us vow to
knit sweaters for all of our friends but
only manage half a sleeve before putting
down the needles? Ditto for home
vegetable gardens, compost bins, and
diets. How many of us start something
new, full of excitement and good
intentions, and then give up—
permanently—when we encounter the
first real obstacle, the first long plateau
in progress?
Many of us, it seems, quit what we
start far too early and far too often. Even
more than the effort a gritty person puts
in on a single day, what matters is that
they wake up the next day, and the next,
ready to get on that treadmill and keep
going.
If I have the math approximately right,
then someone twice as talented but half
as hardworking as another person might
reach the same level of skill but still
produce dramatically less over time.
This is because as strivers are
improving in skill, they are also
employing
 that skill—to make pots,
write books, direct movies, give
concerts. If the quality and
quantity of
those pots, books, movies, and concerts
are what count, then the striver who
equals the person who is a natural in
skill by working harder will, in the long
run, accomplish more.
“The separation of talent and skill,”
Will Smith points out, “is one of the
greatest misunderstood concepts for
people who are trying to excel, who
have dreams, who want to do things.
Talent you have naturally. Skill is only
developed by hours and hours and hours
of
beating on your craft.”
I would add that skill is not the same
thing as achievement, either. Without
effort, your talent is nothing more than
your unmet potential. Without effort,
your skill is nothing more than what you
could have done but didn’t. With effort,
talent becomes skill and, at the very
same time, effort makes skill
productive
.

Chapter 4
# How Gritty Are
YOU?
I recently gave a lecture on grit to
undergraduates at the Wharton School of
Business. Even before I’d cleared my
notes from the podium, an aspiring
entrepreneur rushed to introduce himself.
He was charming—full of the energy
and enthusiasm that makes teaching
young people so rewarding.
Breathlessly, he told me a story meant to
illustrate his own prodigious grit.
Earlier that year, he’d raised thousands
of dollars for his start-up, going to
heroic lengths to do so, and pulling
several all-nighters in the process.
I was impressed and said so. But I
hastened to add that grit is more about
stamina than intensity. “So, if you’re
working on that project with the same
energy in a year or two, email me. I can
say more about your grit then.”
He was puzzled. “Well, I might not be
working on the same thing in a few
years.”
Good point. Lots of ventures that
seem promising at the start turn out
badly. Lots of optimistic business plans
end up in the discard bin.
“Okay, so maybe this
particular
start-up won’t be what you’re working
on. But if you’re
not working in the same
industry, if you’re on to some
totally
unrelated
 pursuit, then I’m not sure your
story illustrates grit.”
“You mean, stay in one company?” he
asked.
“Not necessarily. But skipping around
from one kind of pursuit to another—
from one skill set to an entirely different
one—that’s not what gritty people do.”
“But what if I move around a lot and,
while I’m doing that, I’m working
incredibly hard?”
“Grit isn’t
just
 working incredibly
hard. That’s only part of it.”
Pause.
“Why?”
“Well, for one thing, there are no
shortcuts to excellence. Developing real
expertise, figuring out really hard
problems, it all takes time—longer than
most people imagine. And then, you
know, you’ve got to apply those skills
and produce goods or services that are
valuable to people. Rome wasn’t built in
a day.”
He was listening, so I continued.
“And here’s the really important
thing. Grit is about working on
something you care about so much that
you’re willing to stay loyal to it.”
“It’s doing what you love. I get that.”
“Right, it’s doing what you love, but
not just falling in love—
staying
 in
love.”
How gritty are you? Below is a version
of the
Grit Scale I developed for my
study at West Point and which I used in
other studies described in this book.
Read each sentence and, on the right,
check off the box that makes sense.
Don’t overthink the questions. Instead,
just ask yourself how you compare—not
just to your coworkers, friends, or
family—but to “most people.”

To calculate your total grit score, add
up all the points for the boxes you
checked and divide by 10. The maximum
score on this scale is 5 (extremely
gritty), and the lowest possible score is
1 (not at all gritty).
You can use the chart below to see
how your scores compare to a large
sample of American adults.

Keep in mind that your score is a
reflection of how you see yourself right
now. How gritty you are at this point in
your life might be different from how
gritty you were when you were younger.
And if you take the Grit Scale again
later, you might get a different score. As
this book will continue to show, there is
every reason to believe that grit can
change.
Grit has two components: passion
and perseverance. If you want to dig a
little deeper, you can calculate separate
scores for each component: For your
passion score, add up your points for the
odd-numbered
items and divide by 5.
For your perseverance score, add up
your points for the even-numbered items
and divide by 5.
If you scored high on passion, you
probably scored high on perseverance,
too. And vice versa. Still, I’ll take a
guess that your perseverance score is a
wee bit higher than your passion score.
This isn’t true for all people, but it’s true
for most people I’ve studied. For
instance, I took the scale while writing
this chapter, and I scored 4.6 overall.
My perseverance score was 5.0, and my
passion score was only 4.2. Strange as it
sounds, staying focused on consistent
goals over time is more of a struggle for
me than working hard and bouncing back
from setbacks.
This consistent pattern—
perseverance scores more often topping
passion scores—is a clue that passion
and perseverance aren’t exactly the same
thing. In the rest of this chapter, I’ll
explain how they differ and show how to
understand them as two parts of a whole.
While taking the Grit Scale, you might
have noticed that none of the passion
questions asked how
intensely
 you’re
committed to your goals. This may seem
odd, because the word
passion
 is often
used to describe intense emotions. For a
lot of people, passion is synonymous
with infatuation or obsession. But in
interviews about what it takes to
succeed, high achievers often talk about
commitment of a different kind. Rather
than intensity, what comes up again and
again in their remarks is the idea of
consistency over time
.
For instance, I’ve heard of chefs who
grew up watching Julia Child on
television and remained fascinated with
cooking into adulthood. I’ve heard of
investors whose curiosity about the
financial markets is as keen in their
fourth or fifth decade of investing as it
was on their very first day of trading.
I’ve heard of mathematicians who work
on a problem—the
same
 problem—day
and night for years, without once
deciding, “Oh, to heck with this theorem!
I’m moving on to something else.” And
that’s
why the questions that generate
your passion score ask you to reflect on
how
steadily
 you hold to goals over
time. Is
passion
 the right word to
describe sustained, enduring devotion?
Some might say I should find a better
word. Maybe so. But the important thing
is the idea itself: Enthusiasm is common.
Endurance is rare.
Consider, for example, Jeffrey
Gettleman. For about a decade, Jeff has
been the East Africa bureau chief for the
New York Times
. In 2012, he won the
Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting
for his coverage of conflict in East
Africa. He’s a bit of a celebrity in the
world of international journalism,
widely admired for his courage to
pursue stories that put his life at risk
and, also, for his willingness to
unflinchingly report events that are
unthinkably horrific.
I met Jeff when we were in our early
twenties. At the time, both of us were
pursuing master’s degrees at Oxford
University. For me, this was before
McKinsey, before teaching, and before
becoming a psychologist. For Jeff, this
was before he’d written his first news
story. I think it’s fair to say that, back
then, neither of us knew quite what we
wanted to be when we grew up—and we
were both trying desperately to figure it
out.
I caught up with Jeff on the phone
recently. He was in Nairobi, his home
base between trips to other parts of
Africa. Every few minutes, we had to
ask each other if we could still be heard.
After reminiscing about our classmates
and trading news about our children, I
asked Jeff to reflect on the idea of
passion and how it had played out in his
life.
“For a very long time, I’ve had a very
clear sense of where I wanted to be,”
Jeff told me. “And that passion is to live
and
work in East Africa.”
“Oh, I didn’t know—I assumed your
passion was journalism, not a certain
area of the world. If you could only be a
journalist or only live in East Africa,
which would you choose?”
I expected Jeff to pick journalism. He
didn’t.
“Look, journalism is a great fit for
me. I’ve always gravitated towards
writing. I’ve always been okay being in
new situations. Even the
confrontational
side of journalism—that speaks to my
personality. I like to challenge authority.
But I think journalism has been, in a
sense, a means to an end.”
Jeff’s passion emerged over a period
of years. And it wasn’t just a process of
passive discovery—of unearthing a little
gem hidden inside his psyche—but
rather of active construction. Jeff didn’t
just go looking for his passion—he
helped create it.
Moving to Ithaca, New York, from
Evanston, Illinois, Jeff, at eighteen years
old, could not have predicted his future
career. At Cornell, he ended up majoring
in philosophy, in part because
“it was
the easiest to fulfill the requirements.”
Then, the summer after freshman year, he
visited East Africa. And that was the
beginning of the beginning: “I don’t
know how to explain it. This place just
blew my mind. There was a spirit here
that I wanted to connect with, and
I
wanted to make it a part of my life.”
As soon as he got back to Cornell,
Jeff started taking courses in Swahili,
and after sophomore year, he took a year
off to backpack around the world.
During that trip, he returned to East
Africa, experiencing the same wonder
he’d felt the first time he visited.
Still, it wasn’t clear how he’d make a
life there. How did he hit on journalism
as a career path? A professor who
admired Jeff’s writing suggested as
much, and Jeff remembers thinking,
“That is the dumbest idea I had heard . . .
who wants to work for a boring
newspaper?” (I remember thinking the
same thing once about becoming a
professor:
Who wants to be a boring
professor?
) Eventually, Jeff did work
for the student paper, the
Cornell Daily
Sun
—but as a photographer, not a
writer.
“When I got to Oxford,
I was pretty
lost academically. It was shocking to the
Oxford professors that I didn’t really
know what I wanted to do. They were
like, ‘Why are you here? This is a
serious place. You should have a firm
sense of what you want to study or you
shouldn’t be here.’ ”
My guess at the time was that Jeff
would pursue photojournalism.
He
reminded me of Robert Kincaid, the
worldly, wise photographer played by
Clint Eastwood in
The Bridges of
Madison County
, which was released
around the time we became friends. In
fact, I can still remember the
photographs Jeff showed me twenty
years ago. I thought they were from
National Geographic
, but he’d actually
taken them himself.
By his second year at Oxford, he
figured out that journalism was an even
better fit: “Once I learned more about
being a journalist and how that could get
me back to Africa, and how that actually
would be fun, and I could write more
creatively than I first imagined
journalism was, then I was like, ‘Screw
it, this is what I’m going to do.’ I set out
a very deliberate path that was possible,
because the journalism industry was
very hierarchical, and it was clear how
to get from A to B to C to D, et cetera.”
Step A was writing for Oxford’s
student newspaper,
Cherwell
. Step B
was a summer internship at a small
paper in Wisconsin. Step C was the
St.
Petersburg Times
 in Florida on the
Metro beat. Step D was the
Los Angeles
Times
. Step E was the
New York Times
as a national correspondent in Atlanta.
Step F was being sent overseas to cover
war stories, and in 2006—just over a
decade since he’d set himself the goal—
he finally reached step G: becoming the
New York Times
’ East Africa bureau
chief.
“It was a really winding road that
took me to all kinds of places. And it
was difficult, and discouraging, and
demoralizing, and scary, and all the rest.
But eventually, I got here. I got exactly
where I wanted to be.”
As for so many other grit paragons,
the common metaphor of passion as
fireworks doesn’t make sense when you
think of what passion means to Jeff
Gettleman. Fireworks erupt in a blaze of
glory but quickly fizzle, leaving just
wisps of smoke and a memory of what
was once spectacular. What Jeff’s
journey suggests instead is passion as a
compass
—that thing that takes you some
time to build, tinker with, and finally get
right, and that then guides you on your
long and winding road to where,
ultimately, you want to be.
Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll
puts it this way: “Do you
have a life
philosophy?”
For some of us, the question makes no
sense. We might say:
Well, I have a lot
of things I’m pursuing. A lot of goals. A
lot of projects. Which do you mean?
But others have no problem
answering with conviction:
This is what
I want
.
Everything becomes a bit clearer
when you understand the level of the
goal Pete is asking about. He’s not
asking about what you want to get done
today, specifically, or even this year.
He’s asking what you’re trying to get out
of life. In grit terms, he’s asking about
your passion.
Pete’s philosophy is:
Do things
better than
they have ever been done
before.
 Like with Jeff, it took a while to
figure out what, in the broader sense, he
was aiming for. The pivotal moment
came at a low point in his coaching
career: just after getting fired as head
coach of the New England Patriots. This
was the first and only year in his life
when Pete wasn’t playing or coaching
football. At that juncture, one of his good
friends urged him to consider something
more abstract than which job to take
next: “You’ve got to have a philosophy.”
Pete realized he didn’t have one and
needed to: “If I was ever going to get the
chance to run an organization again, I
would have to be prepared with a
philosophy that would
drive all my
actions.” Pete did a lot of thinking and
reflecting: “My life in the next weeks
and months was filled with writing notes
and filling binders.” At the same time, he
was devouring the books of John
Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball
coach who won a record-setting ten
national championships.
Like a lot of coaches, Pete had
already read Wooden. But this time, he
was reading Wooden and understanding,
at a much deeper level, what the
coaching icon had to say. And the most
important thing
Wooden said was that,
though a team has to do a million things
well, figuring out the overarching vision
is of utmost importance.
Pete realized in that moment that
particular goals—winning a particular
game, or even a seasonal championship,
or figuring out this element of the
offensive lineup, or the way to talk to
players—needed coordination, needed
purpose: “A clear, well-defined
philosophy gives you the guidelines and
boundaries that keep you on track,” he
said.
One way to understand what Pete is
talking about is to envision
goals in a
hierarchy.
At the bottom of this hierarchy are
our most concrete and specific goals—
the tasks we have on our short-term to-
do list: I want to get out the door today
by eight a.m. I want to call my business
partner back. I want to finish writing the
email I started yesterday. These low-
level goals exist merely as
means to
ends
. We want to accomplish them only
because they get us something
else
 we
want. In contrast, the higher the goal in
this hierarchy, the more abstract,
general, and important it is. The higher
the goal, the more it’s an end in itself,
and the less it’s merely a
means
 to an
end.
In the diagram I’ve sketched out here,
there are just three levels. That’s an
oversimplification. Between the lowest
and the highest level might be several
layers of mid-level goals. For instance,
getting out the door by eight a.m. is a
low-level goal. It only matters because
of a mid-level goal: arriving at work on
time. Why do you care about that?
Because you want to be punctual. Why
do you care about that? Because being
punctual shows respect for the people
with whom you work. Why is that
important? Because you strive to be a
good leader.
If in the course of asking yourself
these “Why?” questions your answer is
simply “Just because!” then you know
you’ve gotten to the top of a goal
hierarchy. The top-level goal is not a
means to any other end. It is, instead, an
end in itself
. Some psychologists like to
call this
an “ultimate concern.” Myself, I
think of this top-level goal as a compass
that gives direction and meaning to all
the goals below it.
Consider Hall of Fame pitcher Tom
Seaver.
When he retired in 1987 at the
age of forty-two, he’d compiled 311
wins; 3,640 strikeouts; 61 shutouts; and
a 2.86 earned run average. In 1992,
when Seaver was elected to the Hall of
Fame, he received the highest-ever
percentage of votes: 98.8 percent.
During his twenty-year professional
baseball career, Seaver aimed to pitch
“the best I possibly can
day after day,
year after year.” Here is how that
intention gave meaning and structure to
all his lower-order goals:
Pitching . . . determines what I eat,
when I go to bed, what I do when
I’m awake. It determines how I
spend my life when I’m not
pitching. If it means I have to come
to Florida and can’t get tanned
because I might get a burn that
would keep me from throwing for
a few days, then I never go
shirtless in the sun. . . . If it means
I have to remind myself to pet
dogs with my left hand or throw
logs on the fire with my left hand,
then I do that, too. If it means in
the winter I eat cottage cheese
instead of chocolate chip cookies
in order to keep my weight down,
then I eat cottage cheese.
The life Seaver described sounds grim.
But that’s not how Seaver saw things:
“Pitching is what makes me happy. I’ve
devoted my life to it. . . . I’ve made up
my mind what I want to do. I’m happy
when I pitch well so I only do things that
help me be happy.”
What I mean by passion is not just
that you have something you care about.
What I mean is that you care about that
same
 ultimate goal in an abiding, loyal,
steady way. You are not capricious.
Each day, you wake up thinking of the
questions you fell asleep thinking about.
You are, in a sense, pointing in the same
direction, ever eager to take even the
smallest step forward than to take a step
to the side, toward some other
destination. At the extreme, one might
call your focus obsessive. Most of your
actions derive their significance from
their allegiance to your ultimate concern,
your life philosophy.
You have your priorities in order.
Grit is about holding the same top-level
goal for a very long time. Furthermore,
this “life philosophy,” as Pete Carroll
might put it, is so interesting and
important that it organizes a great deal of
your waking activity. In very gritty
people, most mid-level and low-level
goals are, in some way or another,
related to that ultimate goal. In contrast,
a lack of grit can come from having less
coherent goal structures.
Here are a few ways a lack of grit
can show itself. I’ve met many young
people who can articulate a dream—for
example, to be a doctor or to play
basketball in the NBA—and can vividly
imagine how wonderful that would be,
but they can’t point to the mid-level and
lower-level goals that will get them
there. Their goal hierarchy has a top-
level goal but no supporting mid-level
or low-level goals:
This is what my good friend and
fellow psychologist Gabriele Oettingen
calls
“positive fantasizing.” Gabriele’s
research suggests that indulging in
visions of a positive future without
figuring out how to get there, chiefly by
considering what obstacles stand in the
way, has short-term payoffs but long-
term costs. In the short-term, you feel
pretty great about your aspiration to be a
doctor. In the long-term, you live with
the disappointment of not having
achieved your goal.
Even more common, I think, is having
a bunch of mid-level goals that don’t
correspond to any unifying, top-level
goal:

Or having a few competing goal
hierarchies that aren’t in any way
connected with each other:
To some extent, goal conflict is a
necessary feature of human existence.
For instance, I have one goal hierarchy
as a professional and another as a
mother. Even Tom Seaver admits that the
travel and practice schedule of a
professional baseball player made it
hard to spend as much time with his wife
and children as he would have liked. So,
though pitching was his professional
passion, there were other goal
hierarchies that obviously mattered to
him.
Like Seaver, I have one goal
hierarchy for work:
Use psychological
science to help kids thrive
. But I have a
separate goal hierarchy that involves
being the best mother I can be to my two
daughters. As any
working parent
knows, having two “ultimate concerns”
isn’t easy. There seems never to be
enough time, energy, or attention to go
around. I’ve decided to live with that
tension. As a young woman, I considered
alternatives—not having my career or
not raising a family—and decided that,
morally, there was no “right decision,”
only a decision that was right for me.
So, the idea that every waking
moment in our lives should be guided by
one top-level goal is an idealized
extreme that may not be desirable even
for the grittiest of us. Still, I would argue
that it’s possible to pare down long lists
of mid-level and low-level work goals
according to how they serve a goal of
supreme importance. And I think
one
top-level
professional
 goal, rather than
any other number, is ideal.
In sum, the more unified, aligned, and
coordinated our goal hierarchies, the
better.
Warren Buffett—the self-made
multibillionaire whose personal wealth,
acquired entirely within his own
lifetime, is roughly twice the size of
Harvard University’s endowment
—
reportedly gave his pilot a simple
three-step process for prioritizing.
The story goes like this: Buffett turns
to his faithful pilot and says that he must
have dreams greater than flying Buffett
around to where he needs to go. The
pilot confesses that, yes, he does. And
then Buffett takes him through three
steps.
First, you write down a list of
twenty-five career goals.
Second, you do some soul-searching
and circle the five highest-priority goals.
Just five.
Third, you take a good hard look at
the twenty goals you didn’t circle. These
you avoid at all costs. They’re what
distract you; they eat away time and
energy, taking your eye from the goals
that matter more.
When I first heard this story, I
thought,
Who could have as many as
twenty-five different career goals?
That’s kind of ridiculous, isn’t it?
 Then
I started writing down on a piece of
lined paper all of the projects I’m
currently working on. When I got to line
thirty-two, I realized that I could benefit
from this exercise.
Interestingly, most of the goals I
spontaneously thought of were mid-level
goals. People generally default to that
level of goal when they’re asked to
write down a number of goals, not just
one.
To help me prioritize, I added
columns that allowed me to sort out how
interesting and important these projects
were. I rated each goal on a scale from 1
to 10, from least to most interesting and
then again from least to most important. I
multiplied these numbers together to get
a number from 1 to 100. None of my
goals had an “interest
x
 importance”
rating as high as 100, but none were as
low as 1, either.
Then I tried to take Buffett’s advice
and circle just a few of the most
interesting and important goals,
relegating the rest to the avoid-at-all-
cost category.
I tried, but I just couldn’t do it.
After a day or so of wondering who
was right—me or Warren Buffett—I
realized that a lot of my goals were, in
fact, related to one another. The
majority, in fact, were means to ends,
setting me up to make progress toward
one ultimate goal: helping kids achieve
and thrive. There were only a few
professional goals for which this wasn’t
true. Reluctantly, I decided to put those
on the avoid-at-all-cost list.
Now, if I could ever sit down with
Buffett and go through my list with him
(which is unlikely, since I doubt my
needs rate a place in his goal hierarchy),
he would surely tell me that the point of
this exercise is to face the fact that time
and energy are limited. Any successful
person has to decide what to do in part
by deciding what
not
 to do. I get that.
And I still have a ways to go on that
count.
But I would also say that
conventional prioritizing isn’t enough.
When you have to divide your actions
among a number of very different high-
level career goals, you’re extremely
conflicted. You need
one
 internal
compass—not two, three, four, or five.
Frank Modell, the
New Yorker
, July 7, 1962,
The New Yorker Collection/The Cartoon Bank.
So, to Buffett’s three-step exercise in
prioritizing, I would add an additional
step: Ask yourself,
To what extent do
these goals serve a common purpose?
The more they’re part of the same goal
hierarchy—important because they then
serve the same ultimate concern—the
more focused your passion.
If you follow this method of
prioritization, will you become a Hall of
Fame pitcher or earn more money than
anyone else in history? Probably not. But
you’ll stand a better chance of getting
somewhere you care about—a better
chance of moving closer to where you
want
 to be.
When you see your goals organized in a
hierarchy, you realize that grit is not at
all about stubbornly pursuing—at all
costs and ad infinitum—
every
 single
low-level goal on your list. In fact, you
can expect to abandon a few of the things
you’re working very hard on at this
moment.
Not all of them will work out.
Sure, you should try hard—even a little
longer than you might think necessary.
But don’t beat your head against the wall
attempting to follow through on
something that is, merely, a means to
a
more important end.
I thought about how important it is to
know how low-level goals fit into one’s
overall hierarchy when I listened to Roz
Chast, the celebrated
New Yorker
cartoonist, give a talk at the local
library. She told us her rejection rate is,
at this stage in her career, about 90
percent. She claimed that it used to be
much, much higher.
I called Bob Mankoff, the cartoon
editor for the
New Yorker
, to ask how
typical that number is. To me, it seemed
shockingly high. Bob told me that Roz
was indeed an anomaly.
Phew!
 I thought.
I didn’t want to think about all the
cartoonists in the world getting rejected
nine times out of ten. But then Bob told
me that most cartoonists live with
even
more
 rejection. At his magazine,
“contract cartoonists,” who have
dramatically better odds of getting
published than anyone else, collectively
submit about five hundred cartoons
every week. In a given issue, there is
only room, on average, for about
seventeen of them. I did the math: that’s
a rejection rate of more than 96 percent.
“Holy smokes! Who would keep
going when the odds are that grim?”
Well, for one: Bob himself.
Bob’s story reveals a lot about how
dogged perseverance toward a top-level
goal requires, paradoxically perhaps,
some flexibility at lower levels in the
goal hierarchy. It’s as if the highest-level
goal gets written in ink, once you’ve
done enough living and reflecting to
know what that goal is, and the lower-
level goals get written in pencil, so you
can revise them and sometimes erase
them altogether, and then figure out new
ones to take their place.
Here’s my not-at-all-
New Yorker
–
quality drawing to show what I mean:
The low-level goal with the angry-
looking X through it has been blocked.
It’s a rejection slip, a setback, a dead
end, a failure. The gritty person will be
disappointed, or even heartbroken, but
not for long.
Soon enough, the gritty person
identifies a new low-level goal—draws
another cartoon, for example—that
serves the same purpose.
One of the mottos of the Green Berets
is:
“Improvise, adapt, overcome.” A lot
of us were told as children, “If at first
you don’t succeed, try, try again.” Sound
advice, but as they say “try, try again,
then try something different.” At lower
levels of a goal hierarchy, that’s exactly
what’s needed.
Here’s Bob Mankoff’s story:
Like Jeff Gettleman, the
New York
Times
 East Africa bureau chief, Bob
didn’t always have a clearly defined
passion. As a child, Bob liked to draw,
and instead of attending his local high
school in the Bronx, he went to the
LaGuardia High School of Music and
Art, later fictionalized in the movie
Fame
.
Once there, though, he got a look
at the competition and was intimidated.
“Being exposed to real drawing
talent,” Bob recalls,
“made mine wither.
I didn’t touch a pen, pencil, or
paintbrush for three years after
graduating.” Instead, he enrolled at
Syracuse University, where he studied
philosophy and psychology.
In his senior year, he bought a book
called
Learning to Cartoon
 by the
legendary Syd Hoff, an exemplar of the
“effort counts twice” maxim. Over his
lifetime, Hoff contributed 571 cartoons
to the
New Yorker
, wrote and illustrated
more than sixty children’s books, drew
two syndicated comic strips, and
contributed literally thousands of
drawings and cartoons to other
publications. Hoff’s book opens cheerily
with “Is it hard becoming a cartoonist?
No, it isn’t. And to prove it,
I’ve written
this book. . . .” It ends with a chapter
called “How to Survive Rejection
Slips.” In between are lessons on
composition, perspective, the human
figure, facial expressions, and so on.
Bob used Hoff’s advice to create
twenty-seven cartoons. He walked from
one magazine to another, trying to make a
sale—but not the
New Yorker
, which
didn’t see cartoonists in person. And he
was, of course, summarily rejected by
every editor he saw. Most asked him to
try again, with more cartoons, the next
week. “More?” Bob wondered.
“How
could anyone do more than twenty-seven
cartoons?”
Before he could reread Hoff’s last
chapter on rejection slips, Bob received
notice that he was eligible to be drafted
for combat in Vietnam. He had no great
desire to go; in fact, he had a great
desire
not
 to. So he repurposed himself
—quickly—as a graduate student in
experimental psychology. Over the next
few years, while running rats in mazes,
he found time, when he could, to draw.
Then, just before earning his doctorate,
he had the realization that research
psychology wasn’t his calling: “I
remember thinking that my defining
personality characteristic was something
else.
I’m the funniest guy you ever met—
that’s the way I thought of myself—I’m
funny
.”
For a while, Bob considered two
ways of making humor his career: “I
said, okay, I’m going to do stand-up, or
I’m going to be a cartoonist.” He threw
himself into both with gusto: “All day I
would write routines and then, at night, I
would draw cartoons.” But over time,
one of these two mid-level goals became
more attractive than the other: “Stand-up
was different back then. There weren’t
really comedy clubs. I’d have to go to
the Borscht Belt, and I didn’t really want
to. . . . I knew my humor was not going
to work like I wanted it to for these
people.”
So Bob dropped stand-up comedy
and devoted his entire energy to
cartoons. “After two years of submitting,
all I had to show for it were enough
New
Yorker
 rejection slips to
wallpaper my
bathroom.” There were small victories
—cartoons sold to other magazines—but
by that time Bob’s top-level goal had
become a whole lot more specific and
ambitious: He didn’t just want to be
funny for a living, he wanted to be
among the best cartoonists in the world.
“The
New Yorker
 was to cartooning
what the New York Yankees were to
baseball—the Best Team,” Bob
explains. “If you could make that team,
you too were one of the best.”
The piles of rejection slips suggested
to Bob that “try, try again” was not
working. He decided to do something
different. “I went to the New York
Public Library and
I looked up all the
cartoons back to 1925 that had ever been
printed in the
New Yorker
.” At first, he
thought maybe he didn’t draw well
enough, but it was plain to see that some
very successful
New Yorker
 cartoonists
were third-rate draftsmen. Then Bob
thought that something might be awry
with the length of his captions—too
short or too long—but that possibility
wasn’t supported, either. Captions were
generally brief, but not always, and
anyway, Bob’s didn’t seem unusual in
that respect. Then Bob thought maybe he
was missing the mark with his
type
 of
humor. No again: some successful
cartoons were whimsical, some
satirical, some philosophical, and some
just interesting.
The one thing all the cartoons had in
common was this: they made the reader
think
.
And here was another common
thread: every cartoonist had a personal
style that was distinctively their own.
There was no single “best” style. On the
contrary, what mattered was that style
was, in some very deep and
idiosyncratic way, an expression of the
individual cartoonist.
Paging through, literally, every
cartoon the
New Yorker
 had ever
published, Bob knew he could do as
well. Or better. “I thought, ‘I can do this,
I can do this.’
I had complete
confidence.” He knew he could draw
cartoons that would make people think,
and he knew he could develop his own
style: “I worked through various styles.
Eventually I did my dot style.” The now-
famous dot style of Bob’s cartoons is
called stippling, and Bob had originally
tried it out back in high school, when he
discovered the French impressionist
Georges Seurat.
After getting rejected from the
New
Yorker
 about two thousand times
between 1974 and 1977, Bob sent in the
cartoon, below. It was accepted.
Robert Mankoff, the
New Yorker
, June 20,
1977, The
New Yorker
 Collection/The Cartoon
Bank.
The next year, he sold thirteen
cartoons to the
New Yorker
, then twenty-
five the following year, then twenty-
seven. In 1981, Bob received a letter
from the magazine asking if he’d
consider becoming a contract cartoonist.
He said yes.
In his role as editor and mentor, Bob
advises aspiring cartoonists to submit
their drawings in batches of ten,
“because in cartooning, as in life, nine
out of ten
things never work out.”
Indeed, giving up on lower-level
goals is not only forgivable, it’s
sometimes absolutely necessary. You
should give up when one lower-level
goal can be swapped for another that is
more feasible. It also makes sense to
switch your path when a different lower-
level goal—a different means to the
same end—is just more efficient, or
more fun, or for whatever reason makes
more sense than your original plan.
On any long journey, detours are to be
expected.
However, the higher-level the goal,
the more it makes sense to be stubborn.
Personally, I try not to get too hung up on
a particular rejected grant application,
academic paper, or failed experiment.
The pain of those failures is real, but I
don’t dwell on them for long before
moving on. In contrast, I don’t give up as
easily on mid-level goals, and frankly, I
can’t imagine anything that would change
my ultimate aim, my life philosophy, as
Pete might say. My compass, once I
found all the parts and put it together,
keeps pointing me in the same direction,
week after month after year.
Long before I conducted the first
interviews that put me on the trail of grit,
a Stanford psychologist named Catharine
Cox was, herself, cataloging the
characteristics of high achievers.
In 1926, Cox published her findings,
based on the biographical details of

exceptionally accomplished historical
figures. These eminent individuals
included poets, political and religious
leaders, scientists, soldiers,
philosophers, artists, and musicians. All
lived and died in the four centuries prior
to Cox’s investigation, and all left
behind
records of accomplishment
worthy of documentation in six popular
encyclopedias.
Cox’s initial goal was to estimate
how smart each of these individuals
were, both relative to one another and
also compared to the rest of humanity. In
pursuit of those estimates, she combed
through the available evidence,
searching for signs of intellectual
precocity—and from the age and
superiority of these accomplishments she
reckoned each person’s childhood IQ.
The published summary of this study—if
you can call a book of more than eight
hundred pages a summary—includes a
case history for each of Cox’s 301,
arranged in order from least to most
intelligent.
According to Cox, the very smartest
in the bunch was the philosopher John
Stuart Mill, who earned an estimated
childhood IQ score of 190 by learning
Greek at age three, writing a history of
Rome at age six, and assisting his father
in correcting the proofs of a history of
India at age twelve. The least intelligent
in Cox’s ranking—whose estimated
childhood IQs of 100 to 110 are just a
hair above average for humanity—
included the founder of modern
astronomy, Nicolaus Copernicus; the
chemist and physicist Michael Faraday;
and the Spanish poet and novelist
Miguel de Cervantes. Isaac Newton
ranks squarely in the middle, with an IQ
of 130—the bare minimum that a child
needs in order to qualify for many of
today’s gifted and talented programs.
From these IQ estimates, Cox
concluded that, as a group,
accomplished historical figures are
smarter than most of us. No surprise
there.
A more unexpected observation was
how little IQ mattered in distinguishing
the most from the least accomplished.
The average childhood IQ of the most
eminent geniuses, whom Cox dubbed the
First Ten, was 146. The average IQ of
the least eminent, dubbed the Last Ten,
was 143. The spread was trivial. In
other words, the relationship
between
intelligence and eminence in Cox’s
sample was
exceedingly slight
.

If intellectual talent wasn’t the
determinant of whether a person
ascended to the First Ten or was
relegated to the Last Ten, then what was?
While poring over thousands of pages of
biographical data, Cox and her assistant
also evaluated sixty-seven different
personality traits
for a subset of one
hundred geniuses. Cox deliberately
chose a rainbow of traits—in fact, she
covered the full range of what modern
psychologists consider to be important
—to allow for the fullest possible
exploration of the differences that set
apart the eminent from the rest of
humanity and, further, the First Ten from
the Last Ten.
For most of the sixty-seven
indicators, Cox found only trivial
differences between the eminent and the
general population. For instance,
eminence had little to do with
extroversion, cheerfulness, or sense of
humor. And not all the high achievers
had earned high marks in school. Rather,
what definitively set apart the eminent
from the rest of humanity were a cluster
of four indicators. Notably, these also
distinguished the First Ten from the Last
Ten—the super-eminent from the merely
eminent. Cox grouped these together and
called them “persistence of motive.”
Two indicators could easily be
rephrased as passion items for the Grit
Scale.
Degree to which he works with
distant objects in view (as
opposed to living from hand to
mouth). Active preparation for
later life. Working toward a
definite goal.
Tendency not to abandon tasks
from mere changeability. Not
seeking something fresh because
of novelty. Not “looking for a
change.”
And the other two could easily be
rewritten as perseverance items for the
Grit Scale.
Degree of strength of will or
perseverance. Quiet
determination to stick to a course
once decided upon.
Tendency not to abandon tasks in
the face of obstacles.
Perseverance, tenacity,
doggedness.
In her summary comments, Cox
concluded that “high but not the highest
intelligence, combined with the greatest
degree of persistence, will achieve
greater eminence than the highest degree
of intelligence
with somewhat less
persistence.”
However
you
 scored on the Grit Scale, I
hope it prompted self-reflection. It’s
progress just clarifying your goals, and
the extent to which they are—or aren’t—
aligned toward a single passion of
supreme importance. It’s also progress
to better understand how well you’re
currently able to persevere in the face of
life’s rejection slips.
It’s a start. Let’s continue, in the next
chapter, to see how grit can and does
change. And, then, in the rest of the
book, let’s learn how to accelerate that
growth.
I
. If, for example, you scored 4.1, you’re
grittier than about 70 percent of the adults in
our sample.

Chapter 5
# Grit Grows
“How much of our grit is in our genes?”
I’m asked some version of this
question pretty much anytime I give a
talk on grit. The nature-nurture question
is a very basic one. We have an intuitive
sense that some things about us—like
our height—are pretty much determined
in the genetic lottery, while other things
—like whether we speak English or
French—are a result of our upbringing
and experience. “You can’t train height”
is a popular expression in basketball
coaching, and many people who learn
about grit want to know if it’s more like
height or more like language.
To the question of whether we get grit
from our DNA, there is a short answer
and a long one. The short answer is “in
part.” The long answer is, well, more
complicated. In my view, the longer
answer is
worth our attention. Science
has made huge strides in figuring out
how genes, experience, and their
interplay make us who we are. From
what I can tell, the inherent complexity
of these scientific facts has led,
unfortunately, to their continually being
misunderstood.
To begin, I can tell you with complete
conviction that every human trait is
influenced by
both
 genes and
experience.
Consider height. Height is indeed
heritable: genetic differences are
a big
reason why some people are really tall,
some really short, and a bunch of people
are of varying heights in between.
But it’s also true that the
average
height of men and women has increased
dramatically in just a few generations.
For instance, military records show that
the average British man was five feet
five inches tall about
150 years ago, but
today that
average is five feet ten inches.
Height gains have been even more
dramatic in other countries; in the
Netherlands, the average man now
stands almost six foot one—a
gain of
more than six inches over the last 150
years. I am reminded of these dramatic
generational gains in height whenever I
get together with my Dutch
collaborators. They bend down
solicitously, but it still feels like
standing in a forest of redwoods.
It’s unlikely that the gene pool has
changed all that dramatically in just a
few generations. Instead, the most
powerful height boosters have been
nutrition, clean air and water, and
modern medicine. (Incidentally,
generational gains in weight have been
even more dramatic, and again, that
seems to be the consequence of eating
more and moving around less rather than
changes in our DNA.) Even within a
generation, you can see the influence of
environment on height. Children who are
provided healthy food in abundance will
grow up taller, whereas malnourishment
stunts growth.
Likewise, traits like
honesty and
generosity and, yes, grit, are genetically
influenced and, in addition, influenced
by experience.
Ditto for IQ,
extroversion,
enjoying the great
outdoors,
having a sweet tooth, the
likelihood that you’ll
end up a chain-
smoker, your risk of
getting skin cancer,
and really any other trait you can think
of. Nature matters, and so does nurture.
Talents, in all their varieties, are also
genetically influenced. Some of us are
born with genes that make it easier to
learn to
carry a tune, or
dunk a
basketball, or
solve a quadratic
equation. But against intuition,
talents
are
not
 entirely genetic: the rate at which
we develop any skill is also, crucially, a
function of experience.
For instance, sociologist Dan
Chambliss swam competitively in high
school but stopped when it seemed clear
he wasn’t going to make it as a
nationally ranked swimmer.
“I’m small,” he explained, “and my
ankles won’t plantar flex.” Come again?
“I can’t point my toes. I can only flex
them. It’s an anatomical limitation.
Which means, basically, at the elite
level,
I could only swim breaststroke.”
After our exchange, I did a little
research on plantar flexion. Stretching
exercises can improve your range of
motion, but the length of certain bones
does make a difference in how flexible
your feet and ankles are.
Still, the biggest impediment to
improving wasn’t anatomy; it was how
he was coached: “In retrospect, I look
back now and can see
I had horribly bad
coaches in a couple of crucial places.
One of my high school coaches—I had
him for four years—literally taught me
zero. Nothing. He taught me how to do a
breaststroke turn, and he taught me
incorrectly.”
What happened when Dan did,
finally, experience good coaching, in
part from hanging around the national
and Olympic coaches he was studying?
“Years later, I got back into the pool,
got in shape again, and swam a two-
hundred-yard individual medley as fast
as I did in high school.”
Again, same story. Not just nature,
and not just nurture. Both.
How do scientists know, with
unwavering conviction, that both nature
and nurture play a role in determining
things like talent and grit? Over the past
few decades, researchers have been
studying identical and fraternal twins,
raised in the same family or raised in
different families. Identical twins have
all the same DNA, while fraternal twins,
on average, only share about half. That
fact, and a whole lot of fancy statistics
(well, not
that
 fancy—more mundane,
really, once a good teacher explains
them to you), allows researchers to infer,
from how similar the twins grow up to
be, the heritability of a trait.
Very recently,
researchers in London
let me know they’d administered the Grit
Scale to more than two thousand pairs of
teenage twins living in the United
Kingdom. This study estimated the
heritability of the perseverance subscale
to be 37 percent and the passion
subscale to be 20 percent. These
estimates are on par for heritability
estimates for other personality traits, and
in the simplest terms, this means that
some of the variation in grit in the
population can be attributed to genetic
factors, and the rest can be attributed to
experience.
I hasten to add that there isn’t just
one
gene that explains the heritability of grit.
On the contrary, dozens of research
studies have shown that almost all
human
traits are polygenic, meaning that
traits are influenced by more than one
gene. Many more, in fact. Height, for
example, is influenced by, at last count,
at least 697 different genes. And some of
the genes that influence height influence
other traits as well. In total, the human
genome contains
as many as twenty-five
thousand different genes, and they tend to
interact with one another and with
environmental influences in
complicated, still poorly understood,
ways.
In sum, what have we learned? First:
grit, talent, and all other psychological
traits relevant to success in life are
influenced by genes and also by
experience. Second: there’s no single
gene for grit, or indeed any other
psychological trait.
I’d like to make a third, important point:
heritability estimates explain why
people differ from the average, but they
say nothing about the average itself.
While the heritability of height says
something about variability—why in a
given population some people are taller
and some shorter—it
says nothing about
how average height has changed. This is
important because it provides evidence
that the environment we grow up in
really does matter, and it matters a lot.
Here’s another striking example, and
one more relevant to the science of
success: the Flynn effect. Named after
Jim Flynn, the New Zealand social
scientist who discovered it, the Flynn
effect refers to startling gains in IQ
scores over the past century. How big
are the gains? On the most widely used
IQ tests today—the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children and the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—
gains have averaged more than fifteen
points
in the last fifty years in the more
than thirty countries that have been
studied. Put another way, if you scored
people a century ago against modern
norms, they would have an average IQ
score of 70—borderline for mentally
retarded. If you scored people today
against the norms of a century ago, we
would have an average IQ score of 130
—the typical cut score for mentally
gifted programs.
When I first learned about the Flynn
effect, I didn’t believe it. How could it
be that we’re all getting that much
smarter so quickly?
I called Jim to share my incredulity—
and my desire to learn more—and,
globe-trotter that he is, he actually flew
all the way to Philadelphia to meet with
me and give a talk on his work. At our
first encounter, I remember thinking that
Jim looked like a caricature of an
academic: tall, a little bony, wire-
rimmed glasses, and a rather unruly head
of curly steel-gray hair.
Flynn began his talk with the basic
facts on IQ change. Digging through the
raw scores of IQ tests taken over the
years, he found that the improvements on
some tests were much bigger than others.
He went to the chalkboard and sketched
out a steep line indicating that scores
had climbed most sharply for IQ tests
assessing abstract reasoning. For
instance, many young children today can
answer the question “Dogs and rabbits:
How are they alike?” They might tell
you that both dogs and rabbits are alive,
or that they’re both animals. In the
scoring
manual, these answers only earn
a half credit. Some children might go so
far as to say that they’re both mammals,
and for that insight, they’d earn a full
credit. In contrast, young children a
century ago might look at you quizzically
and say, “Dogs chase rabbits.” Zero
points.
As a species, we’re getting better and
better at abstract reasoning.
By way of explaining massive gains
in certain IQ subtests but not in others,
Flynn told a story about basketball and
television. Basketball, at all levels of
competition, has gotten more
competitive over the last century. Flynn
played a little ball himself as a student
and remembers the game changing even
within a few years. What happened?
According to Flynn, what happened
was television. Basketball was a great
game to watch on the small screen and
the exposure fueled the game’s
popularity. Once television became a
household fixture, more kids started
playing the game, trying left-handed
layups, crossover dribbles, graceful
hook shots, and other skills that seemed
routine among star players. And by
getting better, each kid inadvertently
enriched the learning environment for the
kids he or she was playing against.
Because one thing that makes you better
at basketball is playing with kids who
are just a little more skilled.
Flynn called this virtuous cycle of
skill improvement
the social multiplier
effect, and he used the same logic to
explain generational changes in abstract
reasoning. More and more, over the past
century, our jobs and daily lives ask us
to think analytically, logically. We go to
school for longer, and in school, we’re
asked, more and more, to reason rather
than rely on rote memorization.
Either small environmental
differences, or genetic ones, can trigger
a virtuous cycle. Either way, the effects
are multiplied socially, through culture,
because each of us enriches the
environment of all of us.
Here is a graph showing how Grit Scale
scores vary by age. These are data from
a large sample of American adults, and
you can see from the
horizontal axis that
the grittiest adults in my sample were in
their late sixties or older; the least gritty
were in their twenties.
One explanation for this data is that
there’s a sort of “reverse Flynn effect”
for grit. For instance, it’s possible that
adults in their seventh decade of life are
grittier because they grew up in a very
different cultural era, perhaps one whose
values and norms emphasized sustained
passion and perseverance more than has
been the case recently. In other words, it
could be that the Greatest Generation is
grittier than the millennials because
cultural forces are different today than
yesterday.
This explanation for why
grit and age
go hand in hand was suggested to me by
an older colleague who, looking over my
shoulder at the same graph, shook his
head and said, “I knew it! I’ve been
teaching the same undergraduates the
same course at the same university for
decades. And I’ll tell you, they just don’t
work as hard these days as they used
to!” My dad, who gave his entire
professional life as a chemist
to DuPont
and quite literally retired with the gold
watch, might say the same of the
Wharton entrepreneur who approached
me after my lecture. Even while pulling
all-nighters for his present venture, the
young man half expected to be on to
something entirely new within a few
years.
Alternatively, it’s possible these age
trends have nothing to do with
generational changes in grit. Instead,
what the data may be showing is how
people
mature
 over time. My own
experience, and the stories of grit
paragons like Jeff Gettleman and Bob
Mankoff suggest that, indeed, grit grows
as we figure out our life philosophy,
learn to dust ourselves off after rejection
and disappointment, and learn to tell the
difference between low-level goals that
should be abandoned quickly and higher-
level goals that demand more tenacity.
The maturation story is that we
develop
the capacity for long-term passion and
perseverance as we get older.
To distinguish between these rival
explanations, we need a different kind of
study. To generate the data I just showed
you, I asked people of different ages
about their current level of grit. What I
got was a snapshot of grit in younger and
older adults. Ideally, I’d follow these
people for the rest of their lives, the way
psychologist George Vaillant followed
the Harvard men. Since the Grit Scale
hasn’t been around very long, I can’t
play you a time-lapse movie of grit over
the life course. What I want is that
movie. What I have is a snapshot.
Fortunately, many other aspects of
personality have been examined
longitudinally. In dozens of studies that
have followed people over years and
decades, the trends are clear. Most of us
become
more conscientious, confident,
caring, and calm with life experience. A
lot of that change happens between the
ages of twenty and forty, but, in fact,
there’s no epoch in the human life span
where personality stops evolving.
Collectively, these data demonstrate
what personality psychologists now call
“the maturity principle.”
We grow up. Or at least, most of us
do.
To some extent, these changes are
preprogrammed and biological. Puberty
and menopause are things that change
our personalities, for example. But on
the whole, personality change is more a
function of life experience.
Exactly how do life experiences
change personality?
One reason we change is that we
learn something we simply didn’t know
before. For instance, we might learn
through trial and error that repeatedly
swapping out one career ambition for
another is unfulfilling. That’s certainly
what happened to me in my twenties.
After running a nonprofit, then pursuing
neuroscience research, then management
consulting, then teaching, I learned that
being a “promising beginner” is fun, but
being an actual expert is infinitely more
gratifying. I also learned that years of
hard work are often mistaken for innate
talent, and that passion is as necessary
as perseverance to world-class
excellence.
Likewise, we learn, as novelist John
Irving did, that “to do anything really
well, you have to overextend yourself,”
to appreciate that, “in doing something
over and over again, something that was
never natural becomes almost second
nature,” and finally, that the capacity to
do work that diligently
“doesn’t come
overnight.”
Other than insights about the human
condition, what else is there that changes
with age?
What changes, I think, are our
circumstances. As we grow older, we’re
thrust into new situations. We get our
first job. We may get married. Our
parents get older, and we find ourselves
their caretakers. Often, these new
situations call on us to act differently
than we used to. And, because there’s no
species on the planet more adaptable
than ours, we change. We rise to the
occasion.
In other words, we change when we
need
 to. Necessity is the mother of
adaptation.
Here’s a trivial example. Somehow,
my youngest daughter, Lucy, reached the
age of three without learning to use the
potty. My husband
and I had done our
best to bribe, cajole, and trick her into
leaving diapers behind. We’d read all
the books about all the right things to do,
and we’d tried to do all those things—or
at least we tried as energetically as is
possible for working parents with other
things on their to-do lists. To no avail.
Lucy’s will proved stronger than ours.
Soon after her third birthday, Lucy
changed preschool classrooms: from the
toddler classroom, where almost all the
children were still in diapers, to the “big
kid” classroom, which didn’t even have
a changing table. The first day I dropped
her off in the new room, her eyes
widened to saucers, scanning this new
environment—a little bit afraid, I think,
and more likely than not wishing she
could stay in her old room, where she’d
grown comfortable.
I’ll never forget picking Lucy up that
afternoon. She smiled at me proudly and
announced she’d used the potty. And
then, in so many words, she told me she
was done with diapers. And she was.
Potty training happened in a single
moment in time. How? Because when a
child lines up for the potty with all the
other children and sees that she’s
expected to take her turn, she does
exactly that. She learns to do what she
needs to do.
Bernie Noe, the headmaster of the
Lakeside School in Seattle, recently
shared the following story about his own
daughter. It illustrates the maturity
principle to a T. Noe’s family lives on
campus, and as a teenager, his daughter
was late to school almost every day. One
summer, his daughter got a job folding
clothes at the local American Eagle. On
her first day, the store manager said,
“Oh, by the way, the first time
you’re
late, you’re fired.” She was stunned. No
second chances? All her life, there’d
been patience, understanding, and
second chances.
So then what happened?
“It was amazing,” Noe remembered.
“Quite literally, it was the most
immediate behavior change I’ve ever
seen her make.” Suddenly, his daughter
was setting two alarms to make sure she
was on time, or early, to a job where
being late was simply not tolerated. As a
headmaster
tasked with shepherding
young people along toward maturity,
Noe considers his power to do so
somewhat limited. “If you’re a business,
you don’t care whether a kid thinks
they’re special. What you care about is
‘Can you deliver? If you can’t deliver,
hey, we don’t have any use for you.’ ”
Lectures don’t have half the effect of
consequences.
What the maturity principle comes
down to, I think, is this. Over time, we
learn life lessons we don’t forget, and
we adapt in response to the growing
demands of our circumstances.
Eventually, new ways of thinking and
acting become habitual. There comes a
day when we can hardly remember our
immature former selves. We’ve adapted,
those adaptations have become durable,
and, finally, our identity—the sort of
person we see ourselves to be—has
evolved. We’ve matured.
Taken together, the data I’ve collected
on grit and age are consistent with two
different stories. One story says that our
grit changes as a function of the cultural
era in which we grow up. The other
story says that we get grittier as we get
older. Both could be true, and I have a
suspicion that both
are
, at least to an
extent. Either way, this snapshot reveals
that grit is not entirely fixed. Like every
aspect of your psychological character,
grit is more plastic than you might think.
If grit can grow, how does that happen?
I get emails and letters almost every
day from people who wish they had
more grit. They lament that they never
stuck with anything in order to get really
good at it. They feel they’ve squandered
their talents. They desperately want a
long-term goal, and they want to pursue
that goal with passion and perseverance.
But they don’t know where to begin.
A good place to start is to understand
where you are today. If you’re not as
gritty as you want to be, ask yourself
why
.
The most obvious answer people
come up with goes something like this:
“I guess I’m just lazy.”
Here’s another: “I’m just a flake.”
Or: “I’m congenitally incapable of
sticking with things.”
All of these answers, I think, are
wrong.
In fact, when people drop out of
things, they do so for a reason. Actually,
they do so for
different
 reasons. Any of
the following four thoughts might go
through your head right before you quit
what you’re doing:
“I’m bored.”
“The effort isn’t worth it.”
“This isn’t important to me.”
“I can’t do this, so I might as well
give up.”
There’s nothing wrong—morally or
otherwise—with thoughts like these. As
I tried to show in this chapter, paragons
of grit quit goals, too. But the higher the
level of the goal in question, the more
stubborn they are about seeing it through.
Most important, paragons of grit don’t
swap compasses: when it comes to the
one, singularly important aim that guides
almost everything else they do, the very
gritty tend
not
 to utter the statements
above.
A lot of what I’ve learned about how grit
grows comes from interviewing men and
women who epitomize the qualities of
passion and perseverance. I’ve included
snippets of those conversations
throughout this book so that you, too, can
peer inside the mind and heart of a grit
paragon and see whether there’s a belief,
attitude, or habit worth emulating.
These stories of grit are one kind of
data, and they complement the more
systematic, quantitative studies I’ve
done in places like West
Point and the
National Spelling Bee. Together, the
research reveals the psychological
assets that mature paragons of grit have
in common. There are four. They counter
each of the buzz-killers listed above, and
they tend to develop, over the years, in a
particular order.
First comes
interest
. Passion begins
with intrinsically enjoying what you do.
Every gritty person I’ve studied can
point to aspects of their work they enjoy
less than others, and most have to put up
with at least one or two chores they
don’t enjoy at all. Nevertheless, they’re
captivated by the endeavor as a whole.
With enduring fascination and childlike
curiosity, they practically shout out, “I
love what I do!”
Next comes the capacity to
practice
.
One form of perseverance is the daily
discipline of trying to do things better
than we did yesterday. So, after you’ve
discovered and developed interest in a
particular area, you must devote yourself
to the sort of focused, full-hearted,
challenge-exceeding-skill practice that
leads to mastery. You must zero in on
your weaknesses, and you must do so
over and over again, for hours a day,
week after month after year. To be gritty
is to resist complacency. “Whatever it
takes, I want to improve!” is a refrain of
all paragons of grit, no matter their
particular interest, and no matter how
excellent they already are.
Third is
purpose
. What ripens
passion is the conviction that your work
matters. For most people,
interest
without purpose is nearly impossible to
sustain for a lifetime. It is therefore
imperative that you identify your work
as both personally interesting and, at the
same time, integrally connected to the
well-being of others. For a few, a sense
of purpose dawns early, but for many,
the motivation to serve others heightens
after
 the development of interest and
years of disciplined practice.
Regardless, fully mature exemplars of
grit invariably tell me, “My work is
important—both to me and to others.”
And, finally,
hope
. Hope is a rising-
to-the-occasion kind of perseverance. In
this book, I discuss it after interest,
practice, and purpose—but
hope does
not
 define the last stage of grit. It defines
every
 stage. From the very beginning to
the very end, it is inestimably important
to learn to keep going even when things
are difficult, even when we have doubts.
At various points, in big ways and small,
we get knocked down. If we stay down,
grit loses. If we get up, grit prevails.
Without the meddling of a psychologist
like me, you may have figured grit out all
on your own. You may already have a
deep and abiding interest, a ready
appetite for constant challenge, an
evolved sense of purpose, and buoyant
confidence in your ability to keep going
that no adversity could sink. If so, you’re
probably close to 5 out of 5 on the Grit
Scale. I applaud you!
If, on the other hand, you’re not as
gritty as you wish you were, then there’s
something for you in the chapters that
follow. Like calculus and piano, you can
learn the psychology of grit on your own,
but a little guidance can be a tremendous
help.
The four psychological assets of
interest, practice, purpose, and hope are
not
You have it or you don’t
commodities. You can learn to discover,
develop, and deepen your interests. You
can acquire the habit of discipline. You
can cultivate a sense of purpose and
meaning. And you can teach yourself to
hope.
You can grow your grit from the
inside out. If you’d like to know how,
read on.

# From The
# Inside Out

Chapter 6
# Interest
Follow your passion
 is a popular theme
of commencement speeches. I’ve sat
through my fair share, both as a student
and professor. I’d wager that at least half
of all speakers, maybe more, underscore
the importance of doing something you
love.
For instance, Will Shortz, long-time
editor of the
New York Times
 crossword
puzzle, told students at Indiana
University: “My advice for you is, figure
out what you enjoy doing most in life,
and then try to do it full-time. Life is
short. Follow your passion.”
Jeff Bezos told Princeton graduates
the story of leaving a high-salary, high-
status Manhattan finance job to start
Amazon: “After much consideration, I
took the less safe path
to follow my
passion.” He has also said, “Whatever it
is that you want to do, you’ll find in life
that if you’re not passionate about what
it is you’re working on, you
won’t be
able to stick with it.”
And it’s not just on hot June days in
our cap and gown that we get this
advice. I hear the same thing—over and
over again, nearly verbatim—from the
grit paragons I interview.
So does Hester Lacey.
Hester is a British journalist who has
been interviewing achievers
of the
caliber of Shortz and Bezos—one per
week—since 2011. Her column appears
weekly in the
Financial Times
. Whether
they’re fashion designers (Nicole Farhi),
authors (Salman Rushdie), musicians
(Lang Lang), comedians (Michael
Palin), chocolatiers (Chantal Coady), or
bartenders (Colin Field), Hester
asks the
same questions, including: “What drives
you on?” and “If you lost everything
tomorrow, what would you do?”
I asked Hester what she’s learned
from talking to more than two hundred
“mega successful” people, as she
described them during our conversation.
“One thing that comes up time and
time again is: ‘
I love what I do.’ People
couch it differently. Quite often, they say
just that: ‘I love what I do.’ But they also
say things like ‘I’m so lucky, I get up
every morning looking forward to work,
I can’t wait to get into the studio, I can’t
wait to get on with the next project.’
These people are doing things not
because they have to or because it’s
financially lucrative. . . .”
Follow your passion
 was not the
message I heard growing up.
Instead, I was told that the practical
realities of surviving “in the real world”
were far more important than any young
person living a “sheltered life” such as
my own could imagine. I was warned
that overly idealistic dreams of “finding
something I loved” could in fact be a
breadcrumb trail into poverty and
disappointment. I was reminded that
certain jobs, like being a doctor, were
both high-income and high-status, and
that these things would matter more to
me in the long run than I might
appreciate in the moment.
As you might have guessed, the
individual proffering this advice was my
dad.
“So, why’d you become a chemist?” I
once asked.
“Because my father told me to,” he
answered without a hint of resentment.
“When I was a boy, history was my
favorite subject.” He
then explained that
he’d enjoyed math and science, too, but
there was really no choice when it came
to what he’d study in college. The family
business was textiles, and my
grandfather dispatched each of his sons
to study trades relevant to one stage or
another of textile production. “Our
business needed a chemist, not a
historian.”
As it turned out, the Communist
Revolution in China brought a premature
end to the family textile business. Not
long after he settled here in the United
States, my dad went to work for DuPont.
Thirty-five years later, he retired as the
highest-ranking scientist in the company.
Given how absorbed my dad was in
his work—often lost in reverie about
some scientific or management problem
—and how successful he was over the
arc of his career, it seems worth
considering the possibility that it’s best
to choose practicality over passion.
Just how ridiculous
is
 it to advise
young people to go out and do what they
love? Within the last decade or so,
scientists who study interests have
arrived at a definitive answer.
First, research shows that people are
enormously more satisfied with their
jobs when they do something that
fits
their personal interests. This is the
conclusion of a meta-analysis that
aggregated data from almost a hundred
different studies that collectively
included working adults in just about
every conceivable profession. For
instance, people who enjoy thinking
about abstract ideas are
not
 happy
managing the minutiae of logistically
complicated projects; they’d rather be
solving math problems. And people who
really enjoy interacting with people are
not
 happy when their job is to work
alone at a computer all day; they’re
much better off in jobs like sales or
teaching. What’s more, people whose
jobs match their personal interests are,
in general,
happier with their lives as a
whole.
Second, people
perform
 better at
work when what they do interests them.
This is the conclusion of another meta-
analysis of sixty studies conducted over
the past sixty years. Employees whose
intrinsic personal interests fit with their
occupations do their jobs better, are
more helpful to their coworkers, and
stay at their jobs longer. College
students whose personal interests align
with their major earn higher grades and
are less likely to drop out.
It’s certainly true that you can’t get a
job just doing
anything
 you enjoy. It’s
tough to make a living playing Minecraft,
no matter how good you get at it. And
there are a lot of people in the world
whose circumstances preclude the luxury
of choosing among a broad array of
occupational options. Like it or not,
there are
very real constraints in the
choices we can make about how we earn
a living.
Nevertheless, as William James
foretold a century ago, these new
scientific findings affirm commencement
speech wisdom: the “casting vote” for
how well we can expect to do in any
endeavor is “desire and passion, the
strength of [our] interest. . . .”
In a 2014 Gallup poll, more than two-
thirds of adults said they were not
engaged at work, a good portion of
whom were “actively disengaged.”
The picture is even bleaker abroad.
In a survey of 141 nations, Gallup found
that every country but Canada has even
higher numbers of “not engaged” and
“actively disengaged” workers than the
United States. Worldwide, only 13
percent of adults call themselves
“engaged” at work.
So it seems that very few people end
up loving what they do for a living.
It’s difficult to reconcile the
straightforward directives offered in
inspirational speeches with epidemic
levels of indifference toward work.
When it comes to lining up our
occupations with what we enjoy, how
come so many of us miss the mark? And
does my dad’s success offer a
counterexample to the passion argument?
What should we make of the fact that, by
the time I came along, my father’s work
really was his passion? Should we stop
telling people to
follow your passion
and, instead, tell them to
follow our
orders
?
I don’t think so.
In fact, I see Will Shortz and Jeff
Bezos as terrific inspirations for what
work can be. While it’s naive to think
that any of us could love every minute of
what we do, I believe the thousands of
data points in those meta-analyses,
which confirm the commonsense
intuition that interest matters. Nobody is
interested in everything, and everyone is
interested in something. So matching
your job to what captures your attention
and imagination is a good idea. It may
not guarantee happiness and success, but
it sure helps the odds.
That said, I don’t think most young
people need encouragement to follow
their passion. Most
would
 do exactly
that—in a heartbeat—if only they had a
passion in the first place. If I’m ever
invited to give a commencement speech,
I’ll begin with the advice to
foster a
passion
. And then I’ll spend the rest of
my time trying to change young minds
about how that actually happens.
When I first started interviewing grit
paragons, I assumed they’d all have
stories about the singular moment when,
suddenly, they’d discovered their God-
given passion. In my mind’s eye, this
was a filmable event, with dramatic
lighting and a soundtrack of rousing
orchestral music commensurate with its
monumental, life-changing import.
In the opening scene of
Julie & Julia
,
a younger Julia Child than any of us
watched on television is dining in a
fancy French restaurant with her
husband, Paul. Julia takes one bite of her
sole meunière
—beautifully seared and
perfectly deboned by the waiter
moments before and now napped in a
sauce of Normandy butter, lemon, and
parsley. She swoons. She’s never
experienced anything like this before.
She always liked to eat, but she never
knew
food could be
this
 good.
“The whole experience was an
opening up of the soul and spirit for me,”
Julia said many years later. “
I was
hooked, and for life, as it turned out.”
Such cinematic moments were what I
expected from my grit paragons. And I
think this is also what young graduates—
roasting in their caps and gowns, the
hard edge of the folding chair biting into
their thighs—imagine it must be like to
discover your life’s passion. One
moment, you have no idea what to do
with your time on earth. And the next,
it’s all clear—you know exactly who
you were meant to be.
But, in fact, most grit paragons I’ve
interviewed told me they spent years
exploring several different interests, and
the one that eventually came to occupy
all of their waking (and some sleeping)
thoughts wasn’t recognizably their life’s
destiny on first acquaintance.
Olympic gold medalist swimmer
Rowdy Gaines, for example, told me:
“When I was a kid, I loved sports. When
I got to high school, I went out for
football, baseball, basketball, golf, and
tennis, in that order, before I went for
swimming. I kept plugging away. I
figured I’d just keep going from one
sport to the next until I found something
that
I could really fall in love with.”
Swimming stuck, but it wasn’t exactly
love at first sight. “The day I tried out
for the swim team, I went to the school
library to check out track and field
because I kind of had a feeling I was
going to get cut. I figured I’d try out for
track and field next.”
As a teenager, James Beard Award–
winning chef Marc Vetri was as
interested in music as he was in cooking.
After college, he moved to Los Angeles.
“I went to a music school out there for a
year, and I worked nights in restaurants
to make money. Later, when I was in a
band, I worked mornings in restaurants
so I could do the music thing at night.
Then it was like, ‘Well, I’m making
money in the restaurants, and I’m really
starting to like it, and I’m not making
anything in music.’ And then I had an
opportunity to go to Italy, and that was
it.” It’s hard for me to picture my
favorite chef playing the guitar instead of
making pasta, but when I asked what he
thought about the road not taken, he said,
“Well, music and cooking—they’re both
creative industries.
I’m glad I went this
way, but I think I could have been a
musician instead.”
As for Julia Child, that ethereal
morsel of
sole meunière
 was indeed
a
revelation. But her epiphany was that
classical French cuisine was divine,
not
that she would become a chef, cookbook
author, and, eventually, the woman who
would teach America to make coq au vin
in their very own kitchens. Indeed,
Julia’s autobiography reveals that this
memorable meal was followed by a
succession
 of interest-stimulating
experiences. An incomplete list would
include countless delicious meals in the
bistros of Paris; conversations and
friendships with friendly fishmongers,
butchers, and produce vendors in the
city’s open-air markets; encounters with
two encyclopedic French cookbooks—
the first loaned to her by her French tutor
and the second a gift from her ever-
supportive husband, Paul; hours of
cooking classes at Le Cordon Bleu under
the tutelage of the marvelously
enthusiastic yet demanding Chef
Bugnard; and the acquaintance of two
Parisian women who had the idea of
writing a cookbook for Americans.
What would have happened if Julia—
who once dreamed of becoming a
novelist and, as a child, possessed, as
she put it, “
zero interest in the stove”—
had returned home to California after
that fateful bite of perfectly cooked fish?
We can’t know for sure, but clearly in
Julia’s romance with French food, that
first bite of sole was just the first kiss.
“Really, the more I cook, the more I like
to cook,” she later told her sister-in-law.
“To think it has taken me forty years
to
find my true passion (cat and husband
excepted).”
So, while we might envy those who
love what they do for a living, we
shouldn’t assume that they started from a
different place than the rest of us.
Chances are, they took quite some time
figuring out exactly what they wanted to
do with their lives. Commencement
speakers may say about their vocation,
“I can’t imagine doing anything else,”
but, in fact, there was a time earlier in
life when they could.
A few months ago, I read a post on
Reddit titled “Fleeting Interest in
Everything,
No Career Direction”:
I’m in my early thirties and have
no idea what to do with myself,
career-wise. All my life I’ve been
one of those people who has been
told how smart I am/how much
potential I have. I’m interested in
so much stuff that I’m paralyzed to
try anything. It seems like every
job requires a specialized
certificate or designation that
requires long-term time and
financial investment—before you
can even try the job, which is a bit
of a drag.
I have a lot of sympathy for the thirty-
something who wrote this post. As a
college professor, I also have a lot of
sympathy for the twenty-somethings who
come to me for career advice.
My colleague Barry Schwartz has
been dispensing counsel to anxious
young adults for much longer than I have.
He’s been teaching psychology at
Swarthmore College for forty-five years.
Barry thinks that what prevents a lot
of young people from developing a
serious career interest is unrealistic
expectations. “It’s really the same
problem a lot of young people have
finding a romantic partner,” he said.
“They want somebody who’s really
attractive and smart and kind and
empathetic and thoughtful and funny. Try
telling a twenty-one-year-old that you
can’t find a person who is absolutely the
best in
every
 way. They don’t listen.
They’re holding out for perfection.”
“What about your wonderful wife,
Myrna?” I asked.
“Oh, she
is
 wonderful. More
wonderful than I am, certainly. But is she
perfect? Is she the
only
 person I could
have made a happy life with? Am I the
only
 man in the world with whom she
could have made a wonderful marriage?
I don’t think so.”
A related problem, Barry says, is the
mythology that falling in love with a
career should be sudden and swift:
“There are a lot of things where the
subtleties and exhilarations come with
sticking with it for a while, getting
elbow-deep into something. A lot of
things seem uninteresting and superficial
until you start doing them and, after a
while, you realize that there are so many
facets you didn’t know at the
start, and
you never can fully solve the problem,
or fully understand it, or what have you.
Well, that requires that you stick with it.”
After a pause, Barry said, “Actually,
finding a mate is the perfect analogy.
Meeting a potential match—not the one-
and-only perfect match, but a promising
one—is only the very beginning.”
There’s a lot we don’t know about the
psychology of interest. I wish we knew,
for example, why some of us (including
me) find cooking a fascinating subject,
while many others couldn’t care less.
Why is Marc Vetri attracted to creative
endeavors, and why does Rowdy Gaines
like sports? Aside from the rather vague
explanation that interests are, like
everything else about us, partly heritable
and partly a function of life experience, I
can’t tell you. But scientific research on
the evolution of interests has yielded
some important insights. My sense is
that, unfortunately, these basic facts
aren’t commonly understood.
What most of us think of when we
think of passion is a sudden, all-at-once
discovery—that first bite of
sole
meunière
 bringing with it the certainty of
the years you’ll spend in the kitchen . . .
slipping into the water at your first swim
meet and getting out with the
foreknowledge that you’ll one day be an
Olympian . . . getting to the end of
The
Catcher in the Rye
 and realizing you’re
destined to be a writer. But a first
encounter with what might
eventually
lead to a lifelong passion is exactly that
—just the opening scene in a much
longer, less dramatic narrative.
To the thirty-something on Reddit
with a “fleeting interest in everything”
and “no career direction,” here’s what
science has to say: passion for your
work is a little bit of
discovery
,
followed by a lot of
development
, and
then a lifetime of
deepening
.
Let me explain.
First of all, childhood is generally far
too early to know what we want to be
when we grow up. Longitudinal studies
following
thousands of people across
time have shown that most people only
begin
 to gravitate toward certain
vocational interests, and away from
others,
around middle school. This is
certainly the pattern I’ve seen in my
interview research, and it’s also what
journalist Hester Lacey has found in her
interviews with the “mega successful.”
Keep in mind, however, that a seventh
grader—even a future paragon of grit—
is unlikely to have a fully articulated
passion at that age. A seventh grader is
just beginning to figure out her general
likes and dislikes.
Second, interests are
not
 discovered
through introspection. Instead, interests
are triggered by interactions
with the
outside world. The process of interest
discovery can be messy, serendipitous,
and inefficient. This is because you can’t
really predict with certainty what will
capture your attention and what won’t.
You can’t simply
will
 yourself to like
things, either. As Jeff Bezos has
observed, “One of the huge mistakes
people make is that they try to
force

an
interest on themselves.” Without
experimenting, you can’t figure out
which interests will stick, and which
won’t.
Paradoxically, the initial discovery of
an interest often goes unnoticed by the
discoverer. In other words, when you
just start to get interested in something,
you may not even realize that’s what’s
happening. The emotion of boredom is
always self-conscious—you know it
when you feel it—but when your
attention is attracted to a new activity or
experience, you may have very little
reflective appreciation of what’s
happening to you. This means that, at the
start of a new endeavor, asking yourself
nervously every few days whether
you’ve found your passion is premature.
Third, what follows the initial
discovery of an interest is a much
lengthier and increasingly proactive
period of interest development.
Crucially, the initial triggering of a new
interest must be followed by subsequent
encounters that retrigger your attention—
again and again and again.
For instance, NASA astronaut Mike
Hopkins told me that it was
watching
space shuttle launches on television in
high school that initially inspired his
lifelong interest in space travel. But it
wasn’t just
one
 launch that hooked him.
It was several shown in succession over
a period of years. Soon enough, he
started digging for more information on
NASA, and “
one piece of information
led to another and another.”
For master potter Warren MacKenzie,
ceramics class in college—which he
only took, initially, because all the
painting classes were full—was
followed by the discovery of
A Potter’s
Book
 by the great Bernard Leach, and
then a year-long internship with Leach
himself.
Finally, interests thrive when there is
a crew of encouraging supporters,
including parents, teachers, coaches, and
peers. Why are other people so
important? For one thing, they provide
the ongoing stimulation and information
that is essential to actually liking
something more and more. Also—more
obviously—positive feedback makes us
feel happy, competent, and secure.
Take Marc Vetri as an example. There
are few things I enjoy reading more than
his cookbooks and essays about food,
but he was a solid-C student throughout
school. “I never worked hard at
academics,” he told me. “I was always
just like, ‘This is kind of boring.’ ” In
contrast, Marc spent delightful Sunday
afternoons at his Sicilian grandmother’s
house in South Philly. “She’d make
meatballs and lasagna and all that stuff,
and I always liked to head down early to
help her out. By the time I was eleven or
so,
I started wanting to make that stuff at
home, too.”
As a teenager, Marc had a part-time
job washing dishes in a local restaurant.
“And I loved that. I worked hard.” Why?
Making money was one motivation, but
another was the camaraderie of the
kitchen. “Around that time I was sort of
a social outcast. I was kind of awkward.
I had a stutter. Everyone at school
thought I was weird. I was like, ‘Oh,
here I can wash dishes, and I can watch
the guys on the line [cooking] while I’m
washing, and I can eat. Everyone is nice,
and they like me.’ ”
If you read Marc’s cookbooks, you’ll
be struck by how many friends
and
mentors he’s made in the world of food.
Page through and look for pictures of
Marc alone, and you’ll be hard-pressed
to find many. And read the
acknowledgments of
Il Viaggio Di Vetri
.
It runs to two pages with the names of
people who made his journey possible,
including this note: “Mom and Dad,
you’ve always let me find my own way
and helped guide me through it. You’ll
never know how much I appreciate it.
I’ll always need you.”
Is it “a drag” that passions don’t
come to us all at once, as epiphanies,
without the need to actively develop
them? Maybe. But the reality is that our
early interests are fragile, vaguely
defined, and in need of energetic, years-
long cultivation and refinement.
Sometimes, when I talk to anxious
parents, I get the impression they’ve
misunderstood what I mean by grit. I tell
them that half of grit is perseverance—in
response, I get appreciative head nods—
but I
also
 tell them that nobody works
doggedly on something they don’t find
intrinsically interesting. Here, heads
often stop nodding and, instead, cock to
the side.
“Just because you love something
doesn’t mean you’ll be great,” says self-
proclaimed Tiger Mom Amy Chua. “Not
if you don’t work. Most people stink
at
the things they love.” I couldn’t agree
more. Even in the development of your
interests, there is work—practicing,
studying, learning—to be done. Still, my
point is that most people stink even
more
at what they
don’t
 love.
So, parents, parents-to-be, and non-
parents of all ages, I have a message for
you:
Before hard work comes play.
Before those who’ve yet to fix on a
passion are ready to spend hours a day
diligently honing skills, they must goof
around, triggering and retriggering
interest. Of course, developing an
interest requires time and energy, and
yes, some discipline and sacrifice. But
at this earliest stage, novices
aren’t
obsessed with getting better. They’re
not
thinking years and years into
the future.
They
don’t
 know what their top-level,
life-orienting goal will be. More than
anything else, they’re having fun.
In other words, even the most
accomplished of experts start out as
unserious beginners.
This is also the conclusion of
psychologist Benjamin Bloom, who
interviewed
120 people who achieved
world-class skills in sports, arts, or
science—plus their parents, coaches,
and teachers. Among Bloom’s important
findings is that the development of skill
progresses through three different stages,
each lasting several years. Interests are
discovered and developed in what
Bloom called “
the early years.”
Encouragement during the early years
is crucial because beginners are still
figuring out whether they want to commit
or cut bait. Accordingly, Bloom and his
research team found that the best mentors
at this stage were especially warm and
supportive: “
Perhaps the major quality
of these teachers was that they made the
initial learning very pleasant and
rewarding. Much of the introduction to
the field was as playful activity, and the
learning at the beginning of this stage
was much like a game.”
A degree of autonomy during the
early years is also important.
Longitudinal studies tracking learners
confirm that overbearing parents and
teachers
erode intrinsic motivation. Kids
whose parents let them make their own
choices about what they like are more
likely to develop interests later
identified as a passion. So, while my
dad in Shanghai in 1950 didn’t think
twice about his father assigning him a
career path, most young people today
would find it difficult to fully “own”
interests decided without their input.
Sports psychologist Jean Côté finds
that shortcutting this stage of relaxed,
playful interest, discovery, and
development has dire consequences. In
his research, professional athletes like
Rowdy Gaines who, as children,
sampled a variety of different sports
before committing to one, generally fare
much better in the long run. This early
breadth of experience helps the young
athlete figure out which sport fits better
than others. Sampling also provides an
opportunity to “cross-train” muscles and
skills that will eventually complement
more focused training. While athletes
who skip this stage often enjoy an early
advantage in competition against less
specialized peers, Côté finds that they’re
more likely to become
injured physically
and to burn out.
We’ll discuss what Bloom calls “the
middle years” in the next chapter, on
practice. Finally, we’ll plumb “the later
years” in chapter 8 when we discuss
purpose.
For now, what I hope to convey is
that experts and beginners have
different
motivational needs. At the start of an
endeavor, we need encouragement and
freedom to figure out what we enjoy. We
need small wins. We need applause.
Yes, we can handle a tincture of
criticism and corrective feedback. Yes,
we need to practice. But not too much
and not too soon. Rush a beginner and
you’ll bludgeon their budding interest.
It’s very, very hard to get that back once
you do.
Let’s return to our commencement
speakers. They’re case studies in
passion, so there’s something to be
learned from how they spent their early
years.
New York Times
 puzzle editor Will
Shortz told me that his mother was “a
writer and a lover of words,” and that
her mother, in turn, had been a
crossword fan. An inclination toward
language, Shortz speculated, could very
well be in his genes.
But the unique path he walked was
not just a matter of genetic destiny. Not
very long after he learned to read and
write, Shortz came across a puzzle book.
“I was just entranced by it,” he recalls.
“
I just wanted to make my own.”
Predictably, that first puzzle book—
the initial trigger for his curiosity—was
followed by a slew of others. “Word
puzzles, math puzzles, you name it. . . .”
Soon enough, Shortz knew all of the
major puzzle makers by name, acquiring
the complete Dover Books collection of
his hero Sam Loyd, as well as the works
of a half-dozen other puzzle makers
whose names are as familiar to Shortz as
they are foreign to me.
Who bought all those books?
His mother.
What else did she do?
“I remember when I was very young
my mom had a bridge club over, and to
keep me quiet for the afternoon she took
a piece of paper, ruled it into squares,
and showed me how to enter long words
across and up and down. And I was
happy all afternoon making my little
puzzles. When the bridge club left, my
mother came in and numbered the grid
for me and showed me how to write
clues. So that was
my first crossword.”
And then Shortz’s mother did what
few mothers—including me—would
have the initiative or know-how to do:
“My mom encouraged me to sell my
puzzles once I started making them,
because as a writer, she submitted
articles for publication to magazines and
newspapers. Once she saw this interest
that I had, she showed me how to submit
my work.
“
I sold my first puzzle when I was
fourteen, and I became a regular
contributor to Dell puzzle magazines
when I was sixteen.”
Shortz’s mother was clearly on the
lookout for what might pique her son’s
interest: “My mom did a lot of great
things,” he told me. “For instance, I
loved listening to radio and pop music
and rock music when I was a kid. When
she saw this interest, she got a guitar
from a neighbor and set it on the bunk
bed above my bed. I had the opportunity,
if I wanted it, to pick up the guitar and
start playing.”
But the desire to make music was
nothing compared to the desire to make
puzzles. “After nine months, when I had
never touched the guitar, she took it
back. I guess I liked listening to music,
but I had no interest in playing it.”
When Shortz enrolled at Indiana
University, it was his mom who found
the individualized program that enabled
Shortz to invent his
own major: to this
day, Shortz remains the only person in
the world to hold a college degree in
enigmatology—the study of puzzles.
What about Jeff Bezos?
Jeff’s unusually interest-filled
childhood has a lot to do with his
unusually curious mother, Jackie.
Jeff came into the world two weeks
after Jackie turned seventeen years old.
“So,” she told me, “I didn’t have a lot of
preconceived notions about
what I was
supposed to do.”
She remembers being deeply
intrigued by Jeff and his younger brother
and sister: “I was just so curious about
these little creatures and who they were
and what they were going to do. I paid
attention to what interested each one—
they were all different—and followed
their lead. I felt it was my responsibility
to let them do deep dives into what they
enjoyed.”
For instance, at three, Jeff asked
multiple times to sleep in a “big bed.”
Jackie explained that
eventually
 he
would sleep in a “big bed,” but not yet.
She walked into his room the next day
and found him, screwdriver in hand,
disassembling his crib. Jackie didn’t
scold him. Instead, she sat on the floor
and helped. Jeff slept in a “big bed” that
night.
By middle school, he was inventing
all sorts of mechanical contraptions,
including an alarm on his bedroom door
that made a loud buzzing sound
whenever one of his siblings trespassed
across the threshold. “We made so many
trips to RadioShack,” Jackie said,
laughing. “Sometimes we’d go back four
times in a day because we needed
another component.
“Once, he took string and tied all the
handles of the kitchen cupboards
together, and then, when you opened one,
all of them would pop open.”
I tried to picture myself in these
situations. I tried to picture
not
 freaking
out. I tried to imagine doing what Jackie
did, which was to
notice that her oldest
son was blooming into a world-class
problem solver, and then merrily nurture
that interest.
“My moniker at the house was
‘Captain of Chaos,’ ” Jackie told me,
“and that’s because just about anything
that you wanted to do would be
acceptable in some fashion.”
Jackie remembers that when Jeff
decided to build an infinity cube,
essentially a motorized set of mirrors
that reflect one another’s images back
and forth ad infinitum, she was sitting on
the sidewalk with a friend. “Jeff comes
up to us and is telling us all the science
behind it, and I listen and nod my head
and ask a question every once in a
while. After he walked away, my friend
asked if I understood everything. And I
said, ‘It’s not important that I understand
everything. It’s important that I listen.’ ”
By high school, Jeff had turned the
family garage into a laboratory for
inventing and experimentation. One day,
Jackie got a call from Jeff’s high school
saying he was skipping classes after
lunch. When he got home, she asked him
where he’d been going in the afternoons.
Jeff told her he’d found a local professor
who was letting him experiment with
airplane wings and friction and drag,
and—“Okay,” Jackie said. “I got it.
Now, let’s see if we can negotiate a
legal way to do that.”
In college, Jeff majored in computer
science and electrical engineering, and
after graduating, applied his
programming skills to the management of
investment funds. Several years later,
Jeff built an Internet bookstore named
after the longest river in the world:
Amazon.com. (He also registered the
URL www.relentless.com; type it into
your browser and see where it takes
you. . . . )
“I’m always learning,” Will Shortz told
me. “I’m always stretching my brain in a
new way, trying to find a new clue for a
word, search out a new theme. I read
once—a writer said that if you’re bored
with writing, that means you’re bored
with life. I think the same is true of
puzzles. If you’re
bored with puzzles,
you’re bored with life,
because they’re
so diverse.”
Pretty much every grit paragon I’ve
talked to, including my own dad, says
the same thing. And in examining one
large-scale study after another, I find that
the grittier an individual is, the fewer
career changes they’re likely to make.
In contrast, we all know people who
habitually throw themselves headlong
into a new project, developing a fierce
interest, only to move on after three or
four or five years to something entirely
different. There seems no harm in
pursuing a variety of different hobbies,
but endlessly dating new occupations,
and never settling down with just one, is
a more serious matter.
“I
call them short-termers,” Jane
Golden told me.
Jane has been promoting public art in
my home city of Philadelphia for more
than thirty years as the director of the
revered Mural Arts Program. At last
count, she’s helped convert the walls of
more than 3,600 buildings into murals;
hers is the single largest public art
program in the country. Most people
who know her would describe her
commitment to mural arts as
“relentless,” and Jane would agree.
“Short-termers come work here for a
little while and then they move on, and
then they go somewhere else, and then
somewhere else again, and so on. I’m
always sort of looking at them like
they’re from another planet because I’m
like, ‘How’s that? How do you not lock
in to something?’ ”
Of course, it’s Jane’s unwavering
focus that needs explaining, not the
limited attention spans of the short-
termers who come and go.
Fundamentally, the emotion of boredom,
after doing something for a while, is a
very natural reaction. All human beings,
even from infancy, tend to look away
from things they’ve already seen and,
instead, turn their gaze to things that are
new and surprising. In fact, the word
interest
 comes from the Latin
interesse
,
which means “to differ.” To be
interesting is, literally, to be different.
We are, by our natures, neophiles.
Even though getting tired of things
after a while is common, it’s not
inevitable. If you revisit the Grit Scale,
you’ll see that half the items ask about
how consistent your interests are over
long stretches of time. This links back to
the fact that grit paragons don’t just
discover something they enjoy and
develop that interest—they also learn to
deepen
 it.
As a young woman, Jane thought
she’d become a painter. Now she battles
bureaucratic red tape and raises money
and deals with neighborhood politics. I
wondered whether she’d sacrificed her
life to a cause she felt was more
meaningful but less interesting. I
wondered if she’d given up novelty.
“When I stopped painting, it was very
difficult,” Jane told me. “But then I
discovered that growing the Mural Arts
Program could be a creative endeavor.
And that was great, because I’m a very
curious person.
“From the outside, you might see my
life as mundane: ‘Jane, you’re just
running the Mural Arts Program and
you’ve been doing that forever.’ I would
say, ‘No, listen, today I went to a
maximum security prison. I was in North
Philly. I went to church. I was in a
boardroom. I met with a deputy
commissioner. I met with a city council
person. I worked at an artists’ residency
program. I saw kids graduating.’ ”
Then Jane used a painter’s analogy:
“I’m like an artist who looks at the sky
every morning and sees a variety of
really brilliant colors where other
people would just see blue or gray. I’m
seeing in the course of a single day this
tremendous complexity and nuance. I see
something that is ever evolving and
rich.”
For help understanding the ever-
deepening interests of experts, I turned
to the psychologist Paul Silvia.
Paul is a leading authority on the
emotion of interest. He began our
conversation by pointing out that babies
know just about zilch when they’re born.
Unlike other animals, which have strong
instincts to act in certain ways, babies
need to learn almost everything from
experience. If babies
didn’t

have a
strong drive for novelty, they wouldn’t
learn as much, and that would make it
less likely they’d survive. “So, interest
—the desire to learn new things, to
explore the world, to seek novelty, to be
on the lookout for change and variety—
it’s a basic drive.”
How, then, do we explain the
enduring interests of grit paragons?
Like me, Paul has found that experts
often say things like “The more I know,
the less I understand.” Sir John
Templeton, for example, who pioneered
the idea of diversified mutual funds,
made the motto of his philanthropic
foundation “How little we know,
how
eager to learn.”
The key, Paul explained, is that
novelty for the beginner comes in one
form, and novelty for the expert in
another. For the beginner, novelty is
anything that hasn’t been encountered
before.
For the expert, novelty is
nuance.
“Take modern art,” Paul said. “A lot
of pieces could seem very similar to a
novice that seem very different to an
expert. Novices don’t have the necessary
background knowledge. They just see
colors and shapes.
They’re not sure what
it’s all about.” But the art expert has
comparatively enormous understanding.
He or she has developed a sensitivity to
details that the rest of us can’t even see.
Here’s another example. Ever watch
the Olympics? Ever listen to the
commentators say things, in real time,
like “Oh! That triple lutz was just a little
short!” “That push-off was perfectly
timed”? You sit there and wonder how
these commentators can perceive such
microscopic differences in the
performance of one athlete versus
another without watching the video
playback in slow motion. I need that
video playback. I am insensitive to those
nuances. But an expert has the
accumulated knowledge and skill to see
what I, a beginner, cannot.
If you’d like to follow your passion but
haven’t yet fostered one, you must begin
at the beginning: discovery.
Ask yourself a few simple questions:
What do I like to think about?
Where
does my mind wander? What do I really
care about? What matters most to me?
How do I enjoy spending my time? And,
in contrast, what do I find absolutely
unbearable?
 If you find it hard to
answer these questions, try recalling
your teen years, the stage of life at which
vocational interests commonly sprout.
As soon as you have even a general
direction in mind, you must trigger your
nascent interests. Do this by going out
into the world and
doing
 something. To
young graduates wringing their hands
over what to do, I say,
Experiment! Try!
You’ll certainly learn more than if you
don’t!
At this early stage of exploration,
here are a few relevant rules of thumb
taken from Will Shortz’s essay “How to
Solve the
New York Times

Crossword
Puzzle”:
Begin with the answers you’re
surest of and build from there.
However ill-defined your
interests, there are some things you
know you’d hate doing for a
living, and some things that seem
more promising than others. That’s
a start.
Don’t be afraid to guess.
 Like it
or not, there’s a certain amount of
trial and error inherent in the
process of interest discovery.
Unlike the answers to crossword
puzzles, there isn’t just
one
 thing
you can do that might develop into
a passion. There are many. You
don’t have to find the “right” one,
or even the “best” one—just a
direction that feels good. It can
also be difficult to know if
something will be a good fit until
you try it for a while.
Don’t be afraid to erase an
answer that isn’t working out.
 At
some point, you may choose to
write your top-level goal in
indelible ink, but until you know
for sure, work in pencil.
If, on the other hand, you already
have a good sense of what you enjoy
spending your time doing, it’s time to
develop your interest. After discovery
comes development.
Remember that interests must be
triggered again and again and again.
Find ways to make that happen. And
have patience. The development of
interests takes time. Keep asking
questions, and let the answers to those
questions lead you to more questions.
Continue to dig. Seek out other people
who share your interests. Sidle up to an
encouraging mentor. Whatever your age,
over time your role as a learner will
become a more active and informed one.
Over a period of years, your knowledge
and expertise will grow, and along with
it your confidence and curiosity to know
more.
Finally, if you’ve been doing
something you like for a few years and
still wouldn’t quite call it a passion, see
if you can deepen your interests. Since
novelty is what your brain craves, you’ll
be tempted to move on to something
new, and that could be what makes the
most sense. However, if you want to stay
engaged for more than a few years in
any
 endeavor, you’ll need to find a way
to enjoy the nuances that only a true
aficionado can appreciate. “The old in
the new is what claims the attention,”
said William James. “The old
with a
slightly new turn.”
In sum, the directive to
follow your
passion
 is not bad advice. But what may
be even more useful is to understand
how passions are fostered in the first
place.

Chapter 7
# Practice
In one of my earliest research studies, I
found that
grittier kids at the National
Spelling Bee practiced more than their
less gritty competitors. These extra
hours of practice, in turn, explained their
superior performance in final
competition.
This finding made a lot of sense. As a
math teacher, I’d observed a huge range
in effort among my students. Some kids
spent, quite literally, zero minutes a
week on their homework; others studied
for hours a day. Considering all the
studies showing that gritty people
typically stick with their commitments
longer than others, it seemed like the
major advantage of grit was, simply,
more time on task.
At the same time, I could think of a
lot of people who’d racked up decades
of experience in their jobs but
nevertheless seemed to stagnate at a
middling level of competence. I’m sure
you can, too. Think about it. Do you
know anyone who’s been doing
something for a long, long time—maybe
their entire professional lives—and yet
the best you can say of their skill is that
they’re pretty much okay and not bad
enough to fire? As a colleague of mine
likes to joke: some people get twenty
years of experience, while others get
one
 year of experience . . . twenty times
in a row.
Kaizen
 is Japanese for resisting the
plateau of arrested development. Its
literal translation is: “continuous
improvement.” A while back, the idea
got some traction in American business
culture when it was touted as the core
principle behind Japan’s spectacularly
efficient manufacturing economy. After
interviewing dozens and dozens of grit
paragons, I can tell you that they all
exude kaizen. There are no exceptions.
Likewise, in her interviews with
“mega successful” people, journalist
Hester Lacey has noticed that all of them
demonstrate a striking desire to excel
beyond their already remarkable level of
expertise: “An actor might say, ‘I may
never play a role perfectly, but I want to
do it as well as I possibly can. And in
every role, I want to bring something
new. I want to develop.’ A writer might
say, ‘I want every book I do to
be better
than the last.’
“It’s a persistent desire to do better,”
Hester explained. “It’s the opposite of
being complacent. But it’s a
positive
state of mind, not a negative one. It’s not
looking backward with dissatisfaction.
It’s looking
forward
 and wanting to
grow.”
My interview research made me wonder
whether grit is not just about
quantity
 of
time devoted to interests, but also
quality
 of time. Not just
more time on
task
, but also
better time on task
.
I started reading everything I could
about how skills develop.
Soon enough, this led me to the
doorstep of cognitive psychologist
Anders Ericsson. Ericsson has spent his
career studying how experts acquire
world-class skills. He’s studied
Olympic athletes, chess grandmasters,
renowned concert pianists, prima
ballerinas, PGA golfers, Scrabble
champions, and expert radiologists. The
list goes on.
Put it this way: Ericsson is the
world
expert on world experts.
Below, I’ve drawn a graph that
summarizes what Ericsson’s learned. If
you track the development of
internationally renowned performers,
you invariably find that their skill
improves gradually over years. As they
get better,
their rate of improvement
slows. This turns out to be true for all of
us. The more you know about your field,
the slighter will be your improvement
from one day to the next.
That there’s a learning curve for skill
development isn’t surprising. But the
timescale on which that development
happens is. In one of Ericsson’s studies,
the very best violinists at a German
music academy accumulated about
ten
thousand hours of practice over ten years
before achieving elite levels of
expertise. By comparison, less
accomplished students accumulated
about half as much practice over the
same period.
Perhaps not so coincidentally, the
dancer Martha Graham declared, “It
takes about ten years to
make a mature
dancer.” More than a century ago,
psychologists studying telegraph
operators observed that reaching
complete fluency in Morse code was
rare because of the “many years of hard
apprenticeship” required. How many
years? “Our evidence,” the researchers
concluded, “is that it requires ten years
to make a thoroughly
seasoned press
dispatcher.”
If you’ve read Ericsson’s original
research, you know that ten thousand
hours of practice spread over ten years
is just a rough average. Some of the
musicians he studied reached the high-
water mark of expertise before that, and
some after. But there’s a good reason
why “the ten-thousand-hour rule” and
“the ten-year-rule” have gone viral.
They give you a visceral sense of the
scale of the required investment. Not a
few hours, not dozens, not scores, not
hundreds. Thousands and thousands of
hours of practice over years and years
and years.
The really crucial insight of Ericsson’s
research, though, is
not
 that experts log
more hours of practice. Rather, it’s that
experts practice
differently
. Unlike most
of us, experts are logging thousands upon
thousands of hours of what Ericsson
calls
deliberate practice.
I suspected Ericsson could provide
answers as to why, if practice is so
important, experience doesn’t always
lead to excellence. So I decided to ask
him about it, using myself as a prime
example.
“Look, Professor Ericsson, I’ve been
jogging about an hour a day, several
days a week, since I was eighteen. And
I’m not a second faster than I ever was.
I’ve run for thousands of hours, and it
doesn’t look like I’m anywhere close to
making the Olympics.”
“That’s interesting,” he replied. “May
I ask you a few questions?”
“Sure.”
“Do you have a specific goal for your
training?”
“To be healthy? To fit into my jeans?”
“Ah, yes. But when you go for a run,
do you have a target in terms of the pace
you’d like to keep? Or a distance goal?
In other words, is there a
specific
 aspect
of your running you’re trying to
improve?”
“Um, no. I guess not.”
Then he asked what I thought about
while I was running.
“Oh, you know, I listen to NPR.
Sometimes I think about the things I need
to get done that day. I might plan what to
make for dinner.”
Then he verified that I wasn’t keeping
track of my runs in any systematic way.
No diary of my pace, or my distance, or
the routes I took, my ending heart rate, or
how many intervals I’d sprinted instead
of jogged. Why would I need to do that?
There was no variety to my routine.
Every run was like the last.
“I assume you don’t have a coach?”
I laughed.
“Ah,” he purred. “I think I
understand. You aren’t improving
because you’re
not
 doing deliberate
practice.”
This is how experts practice:
First, they set a stretch goal, zeroing
in on just one narrow aspect of their
overall performance. Rather than focus
on what they already do well, experts
strive to improve specific weaknesses.
They
intentionally seek out challenges
they can’t yet meet. Olympic gold medal
swimmer Rowdy Gaines, for example,
said, “At every practice, I would try to
beat myself. If my coach gave me ten
100s one day and asked me to hold 1:15,
then the next day when he gave me ten
100s,
I’d try to hold 1:14.”
I
 Virtuoso
violist Roberto Díaz describes “working
to find your Achilles’ heel—the specific
aspect of the music
that needs problem
solving.”
Then, with undivided attention and
great effort, experts strive to reach their
stretch goal. Interestingly, many choose
to do so while nobody’s watching.
Basketball great Kevin Durant has said,
“I probably spend 70 percent of my time
by myself, working on my game,
just
trying to fine-tune
every single piece of
my game.” Likewise, the amount of time
musicians devote to practicing alone is a
much better predictor of how quickly
they develop than time spent practicing
with other musicians.
As soon as possible, experts hungrily
seek feedback on how they did.
Necessarily, much of that feedback is
negative. This means that experts are
more interested in what they did
wrong
—so they can fix it—than what they did
right
. The active processing of this
feedback is as essential as its
immediacy.
Here’s how Ulrik Christensen learned
this lesson. Christensen is a physician-
turned-entrepreneur whose adaptive
learning software is designed around the
principles of deliberate practice. One of
his early projects was a virtual reality
game that teaches doctors the proper
handling of urgent, complex cardiac
conditions such as strokes and heart
attacks. During one training session, he
found himself alone with a physician
who seemed unable to finish.
“I couldn’t figure it out,” Christensen
told me. “This guy wasn’t stupid, but
after hours of detailed feedback on what
he’d done wrong, he still wasn’t getting
the right answers. Everyone else had
gone home, and
there we were, stuck.”
Exasperated, Christensen stopped him
just before he got the next round of
feedback. “Time-out,” Christensen said.
“What you just did, treating this patient,
is there anything you did just now where
you were in doubt? Anything where you
weren’t sure it met the new guidelines?”
The doctor thought a moment and then
listed decisions he’d been certain about;
then he named a few choices about
which he was less sure. In other words,
he
reflected
 for a moment on what he
knew and what he didn’t.
Christensen nodded, listening, and
when the doctor was finished, he let him
see the computer screen with the same
feedback that had been displayed a
dozen times before. On the next trial, the
doctor executed the procedure correctly.
And after feedback, then what?
Then experts do it all over again, and
again, and again. Until they have finally
mastered what they set out to do. Until
what was a struggle before is now fluent
and flawless. Until conscious
incompetence becomes unconscious
competence.
In the story of the doctor who finally
took a moment to think about what he
was doing, Christensen kept the practice
going until the doctor was doing the
procedure without any errors at all.
After four consecutive, perfectly correct
repetitions, Christensen said, “Good job.
We’re done with this for the day.”
And . . . then what? What follows
mastery of a stretch goal?
Then experts start all over again with
a
new
 stretch goal.
One by one, these subtle refinements
add up to dazzling mastery.
Deliberate practice was
first studied in
chess players and then in musicians and
athletes. If you’re not a chess player,
musician, or athlete, you might be
wondering whether the general
principles of deliberate practice apply
to you.
Without hesitation, I can tell you the
answer:
YES
. Even the most complex
and creative of human abilities can be
broken down into its component skills,
each of which can be practiced,
practiced, practiced.
For example, deliberate practice is
how Benjamin Franklin described
improving his writing. In his
autobiography, Franklin describes
collecting the very best essays in his
favorite magazine, the
Spectator
. He
read and reread them, taking notes, and
then he hid the originals in a drawer.
Next, Franklin rewrote the essays. “Then
I compared my
Spectator
 with the
original, discovered some of my faults,
and corrected them.” Like the modern-
day experts Ericsson studies, Franklin
zeroed in on specific weaknesses and
drilled them relentlessly. For instance, to
improve his ability to make logical
arguments, Franklin would jumble
his
notes on essays and then attempt to put
them in a sensible order: “This was to
teach me method in the arrangement of
the thoughts.” Likewise, to enhance his
command of language, Franklin
practiced, over and over again, the
translation of prose into poetry and
poetry into prose.
Franklin’s witty aphorisms make it
hard to believe he wasn’t a “natural”
writer from the very start. But perhaps
we should let Franklin himself have the
last word on the matter:
There are
no
gains without pains.
But what if you’re not a writer,
either?
If you’re in business, listen to what
management guru Peter Drucker said
after a lifetime of advising CEOs.
Effective management “demands doing
certain—and fairly simple—things. It
consists of
a small number of
practices. . . .”
If you’re a surgeon, consider what
Atul Gawande has said: “People often
assume that you have to have great hands
to become a surgeon, but it’s not true.”
What’s most important, Gawande said,
is “practicing this one difficult thing day
and night
for years on end.”
If you want to break a world record,
as magician David Blaine did when he
held his breath underwater for seventeen
minutes, watch his TED talk. At the very
end, the man who can control every
aspect of his physiology breaks down,
sobbing: “As a magician, I try to show
things to people that seem impossible.
And I think magic, whether I’m holding
my breath or shuffling a deck of cards, is
pretty simple. It’s practice, it’s training,
and it’s”—he sobs—“experimenting”—
he sobs again—“while pushing through
the pain to be the best that I can be. And
that’s what magic is to me. . . .”
After getting to know each other a little
better, Ericsson and I designed a study to
discover how, exactly, gritty kids
triumph at the National Spelling Bee.
I already knew that grittier spellers
accumulated more practice and
performed better than their less gritty
competitors. What I didn’t know was
whether deliberate practice was driving
these skill improvements, and whether it
was grit that enabled spellers to do more
of it.
With the help of Ericsson’s students,
we began by interviewing spelling bee
finalists to learn what sorts of things they
did to prepare for competition. In
parallel, we
pored through published
books on the topic, including
How to
Spell Like a Champ
 by the bee’s own
national director, Paige Kimble.
We learned that there are basically
three types of activities recommended by
experienced spellers, their parents, and
coaches: First, reading for pleasure and
playing word games like Scrabble.
Second, getting quizzed by another
person or a computer program. Third,
unassisted and solitary spelling practice,
including memorizing new words from
the dictionary, reviewing words in a
spelling notebook, and committing to
memory Latin, Greek, and other word
origins. Only this third category of
activity met the criteria for deliberate
practice.
Several months before the final
competition, spellers were mailed
questionnaires. In addition to the Grit
Scale, we asked them to complete a log
in which they estimated the hours per
week they spent on various spelling
activities. We also asked them to rate
how it felt to do these activities—in
terms of enjoyment and effort—in the
moment they were doing them.
That May, when the finals aired on
ESPN, Anders Ericsson and I were
watching.
Who took home the trophy? A
thirteen-year-old girl named Kerry
Close. It was her fifth consecutive year
of competition, and from the log she
completed in our study, I estimate she’d
accumulated at least three thousand
hours of spelling practice. Kerry’s
triumphant last words at the microphone,
articulated with confidence and a smile,
were: “Ursprache. U-R-S-P-R-A-C-H-
E. Ursprache.”
“I’m
studying as hard as I can for my
last year—to go for it,” Kerry
told a
journalist who’d been tracking her
preparations. “I’m trying to learn words
off the regular list, to learn more obscure
words that have a chance of coming up.”
The year before, the same journalist
made the observation that Kerry “does
more word study by herself. She works
with numerous spelling study guides,
makes lists of interesting words from her
reading, and labors her way through the
dictionary.”
When we analyzed our data, we first
confirmed what I’d found the year
before: grittier spellers practiced more
than less gritty spellers. But the most
important finding was that the
type
 of
practice mattered tremendously.
Deliberate
 practice predicted
advancing to further rounds in final
competition far better than any other
kind of preparation.
When I share these findings with
parents and students, I hasten to add that
there are many, many learning
benefits to
being quizzed. Shining a light on what
you
think
 you know but
actually
 haven’t
yet mastered is one. Indeed, winner
Kerry Close later told me that she used
quizzing to diagnose her weaknesses—to
identify certain words or types of words
she consistently misspelled so that she
could focus her efforts on mastering
them. In a sense, quizzing may have been
a necessary prelude to doing more
targeted, more efficient, deliberate
practice.
What about reading for fun?
Nada
.
Pretty much all of the kids in the
National Spelling Bee are interested in
language, but there wasn’t even a
hint
 of
a relationship between reading for fun,
which they all enjoyed, and spelling
prowess.
If you judge practice by how much it
improves your skill, then deliberate
practice has no rival. This lesson
seemed to become increasingly clear to
spellers as they spent more time
competing. With each successive year of
experience, they spent more time
practicing deliberately. The same trend
was even more pronounced in the month
before
the actual finals, when the
average speller was devoting
ten hours
per week to deliberate practice.
If, however, you judge practice by
what it
feels
 like, you might
come to a
different conclusion. On average,
spellers rated deliberate practice as
significantly
more effortful
, and
significantly
less enjoyable
, than
anything else they did to prepare for
competition. In contrast, spellers
experienced reading books for pleasure
and playing word games like Scrabble
as effortless and as enjoyable as “eating
your favorite food.”
A vivid—if somewhat melodramatic
—firsthand description of what
deliberate practice can feel like comes
from dancer Martha Graham: “Dancing
appears glamorous, easy, delightful. But
the path to the paradise of that
achievement is not easier than any other.
There is fatigue so great that the body
cries even in its sleep. There are times
of complete frustration. There are
daily
small deaths.”
Not everyone would describe
working outside their comfort zone in
such extreme terms, but Ericsson
generally finds that deliberate practice is
experienced as supremely effortful. As
evidence that working at the far edge of
our skills with complete concentration is
exhausting, he points out that even
world-class performers at the
peak
 of
their careers can only handle a maximum
of one hour of deliberate practice before
needing a break, and in total, can only do
about three to five hours of deliberate
practice per day.
It’s also relevant that many athletes
and musicians take naps after their most
intensive training sessions. Why? Rest
and recovery may seem an obvious
necessity for athletes. But nonathletes
say much the same about their most
intense exertions, suggesting that it is the
mental work, as much as the physical
stresses, that makes deliberate practice
so strenuous. For instance, here’s how
director Judd Apatow describes making
a film: “Every day is an experiment.
Every scene might not work and so
you’re concentrating
—Is it working?
Should I get an extra line for editing?
What would I change if I had to, if I
hated
this in three months, why would I
hate it?
 And
you’re concentrating and
you’re exhausted. . . . It’s pretty intense.”
And, finally, world-class performers
who retire tend not to keep up nearly the
same deliberate practice schedule. If
practice was intrinsically pleasurable—
enjoyable for its own sake—you’d
expect them
to keep doing it.
The year after Ericsson and I began
working together, Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi
II
 spent his summer at
my university as a scholar in residence.
Csikszentmihalyi is as eminent a
psychologist as Ericsson, and both have
devoted their careers to studying
experts. But their accounts of world-
class expertise couldn’t be more
different.
For Csikszentmihalyi, the signature
experience of experts is
flow
, a state of
complete concentration “that leads to
a
feeling of spontaneity.” Flow is
performing at high levels of challenge
and yet feeling “effortless,” like “you
don’t have to think about it, you’re just
doing it.”
For example, an orchestra conductor
told Csikszentmihalyi:
You are in an ecstatic state to such
a point that you feel as though you
almost don’t exist. . . . My hand
seems devoid of myself, and I
have nothing to do with what’s
happening. I just sit there watching
in a state of awe and wonderment.
And [the music]
just flows out by
itself.
And a competitive figure skater gave
this description of the flow state:
It was just one of those programs
that clicked. I mean everything
went right, everything felt
good . . . it’s just such a rush, like
you
could feel it could go on and
on and on, like you don’t want it to
stop because it’s going so well.
It’s almost as though you don’t
have to think, everything goes
automatically without thinking. . . .
Csikszentmihalyi has gathered similar
first-person reports from hundreds of
experts. In every field studied, optimal
experience is described in similar terms.
Ericsson is skeptical that deliberate
practice could ever feel as enjoyable as
flow. In his view, “skilled people can
sometimes experience highly enjoyable
states (‘flow’ as described by Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) during their
performance. These states are, however,
incompatible with deliberate
practice. . . .” Why? Because deliberate
practice is carefully planned, and flow
is spontaneous. Because deliberate
practice requires working where
challenges exceed skill, and flow is
most commonly experienced when
challenge and skill are in balance. And,
most important, because deliberate
practice is exceptionally effortful, and
flow is, by definition, effortless.
Csikszentmihalyi has published a
contrary opinion: “Researchers who
study the development of talents have
concluded that to learn any complex skill
well takes about 10,000 hours of
practice. . . . And the practice can be
very boring and unpleasant. While this
state of affairs is all too often true, the
consequences are
by no means self-
evident.” Csikszentmihalyi goes on to
share a personal story that helps explain
his perspective. In Hungary, where he
grew up, on the tall wooden gate at the
entrance to the local elementary school,
hung a sign that read:
The roots of
knowledge are bitter,
but its fruits are
sweet.
 This always struck him as deeply
untrue: “Even when the learning is
hard,” he writes, “it is not bitter when
you feel that it is worth having, that you
can master it, that practicing what you
learned will express who you are and
help you
achieve what you desire.”
So who’s right?
As fate would have it, the same
summer Csikszentmihalyi was visiting,
Ericsson was also in town. I arranged
for them to debate the topic of “
passion
and world-class performance” before an
audience of about eighty educators.
When they sat down at the table in the
front of the lecture hall, I realized that
the two men are near-perfect
doppelgängers. Both are tall and solidly
built. Both are European by birth, with
slight accents that somehow make them
seem even more eminent and scholarly.
Both sport close-cropped beards, and
though only Csikszentmihalyi’s has gone
all white, either man would be a good
choice if you were looking for someone
to play Santa Claus.
On the day of the panel, I was a little
anxious. I don’t like conflict—even
when it’s not mine.
It turns out I had nothing to worry
about. The proponents of deliberate
practice versus flow behaved as perfect
gentlemen. No insults were exchanged.
There wasn’t even a hint of disrespect.
Instead, Ericsson and
Csikszentmihalyi sat shoulder to
shoulder, each taking the microphone
when it was their turn, each
methodically summarizing decades of
research supporting starkly contrasting
perspectives. When one was speaking,
the other appeared to listen intently. And
then the microphone would change
hands. So it went for ninety minutes.
Do experts suffer
, I wanted to know.
Or are they ecstatic?
Somehow, the dialogue I hoped
would resolve this conundrum played
out as two separate presentations—one
on deliberate practice and the other on
flow—spliced together.
When it was all over, I found myself
a little disappointed. It wasn’t the drama
that I missed, it was the resolution. I still
didn’t have an answer to my question: Is
expert performance a matter of arduous
and not-so-fun-in-the-moment exertion,
or can it be effortless and joyous?
For years after that anticlimactic summit,
I read and thought about the issue.
Finally, because I never developed the
conviction that might prompt me to reject
one side and take the other, I decided to
collect some data. I asked thousands of
adults who’d taken the Grit Scale online
to take a second questionnaire assessing
flow. The participants in this study
included men and women of all ages
representing all manner of professions:
actors, bakers, bank tellers, barbers,
dentists, doctors, police officers,
secretaries, teachers, waiters, and
welders . . . to name just a few.
Across these diverse occupations,
grittier adults reported experiencing
more
 flow, not less. In other words,
flow
and grit go hand in hand.
Putting together what I learned from
this survey, the findings on National
Spelling Bee finalists, and a decadelong
inspection of the relevant research
literature, I’ve come to the following
conclusion:
Gritty people do more
deliberate practice
 and
experience
more flow
. There’s no contradiction
here, for two reasons. First, deliberate
practice is a behavior, and flow is an
experience. Anders Ericsson is talking
about what experts
do
; Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi is talking about how
experts
feel
. Second, you don’t have to
be doing deliberate practice and
experiencing flow at the same time. And,
in fact, I think that for most experts, they
rarely go together.
More research is needed to settle the
question, and in the next few years, I’m
hoping that Ericsson, Csikszentmihalyi,
and I can collaborate to do exactly that.
Currently, my view is that the primary
motivation for doing effortful deliberate
practice is to improve your skill. You’re
concentrating one hundred percent, and
you’ve deliberately set the level of
challenge to exceed your current level of
skill. You’re in “problem solving”
mode, analyzing everything you do to
bring it closer to the ideal—the goal you
set at the beginning of the practice
session. You’re getting feedback, and a
lot of that feedback is about what you’re
doing wrong, and you’re using that
feedback to make adjustments and try
again.
The motivation that predominates
during flow, in contrast, is entirely
different. The flow state is intrinsically
pleasurable. You don’t care whether
you’re improving some narrow aspect of
your skill set. And though you’re
concentrating one hundred percent,
you’re not at all in “problem solving”
mode. You’re not analyzing what you’re
doing; you’re just doing. You’re getting
feedback, but because the level of
challenge
just meets
 your current level
of skill, that feedback is telling you that
you’re doing a lot right. You feel like
you’re in complete control, because you
are. You’re floating. You lose track of
time. No matter how fast you’re running
or how intensely you’re thinking, when
you’re in flow, everything
feels
effortless.
In other words, deliberate practice is
for preparation, and flow is for
performance.
Let’s return to swimmer Rowdy
Gaines.
Gaines told me he once tabulated
how much practice it took to develop the
stamina, technique, confidence, and
judgment to win an Olympic gold medal.
In the eight-year period leading up to the
1984 games, he swam, in increments of
fifty-yard laps, at least twenty thousand
miles. Of course, if you add in the years
before and after, the odometer goes even
higher.
“
I swam around the world,” he told
me with a soft laugh, “for a race that
lasted forty-nine seconds.”
“Did you enjoy those miles?” I asked.
“I mean, did you love practicing?”
“I’m not going to lie,” he replied. “I
never really enjoyed going to practice,
and I certainly didn’t enjoy it while I
was there. In fact, there were brief
moments, walking to the pool at four or
four-thirty in the morning, or sometimes
when I couldn’t take the pain, when I’d
think, ‘God, is this worth it?’ ”
“So why didn’t you quit?”
“It’s very simple,” Rowdy said. “It’s
because I loved swimming. . . . I had a
passion for competing, for the
result
 of
training, for the feeling of being in
shape, for winning, for traveling, for
meeting friends. I hated practice, but I
had an overall passion for swimming.”
Olympic gold medalist rower Mads
Rasmussen offered a similar account of
his motivation: “
It’s about hard work.
When it’s not fun, you do what you need
to do anyway. Because when you
achieve results, it’s incredibly fun. You
get to enjoy the ‘Aha’ at the end, and that
is what drags you along a lot of the
way.”
The idea of years of challenge-
exceeding-skill practice leading to
moments of challenge-meeting-skill flow
explains why elite performance can
look
so effortless: in a sense, it
is
. Here’s an
example. Eighteen-year-old swimmer
Katie Ledecky recently broke her own
world record in the 1,500-meter
freestyle. Improbably, history was made
during a preliminary round at a
competition in Kazan, Russia. “To be
honest, it felt pretty easy,” she said
afterward. “I was so relaxed.” But it’s
not flow to which Ledecky credits her
speed: “Breaking that record is
testament to the work I have put in and
the shape I am in right now.”
Indeed, Ledecky has been swimming
since she was six. She’s developed a
reputation for working fiercely hard at
every single practice, sometimes training
with male swimmers for added
challenge. Three years ago, Ledecky
described blanking out a little bit in the
race that won her the gold medal in the
eight-hundred-meter freestyle. “One
thing in terms of swimming that people
don’t really know,” she later said, “is
that the work you put in [during] practice
shows off in the meet.”
Here’s my own story of hours of effortful
deliberate practice leading to moments
of effortless flow. A few years ago, a
producer named Juliet Blake called to
ask if I’d be interested in giving a six-
minute TED talk. “Sure,” I said. “Sounds
fun!”
“Wonderful! After you have your talk
ready, we’ll have a video conference
where we watch you give it, and we’ll
give you some feedback. You know,
something like a rehearsal.”
Hmmm, “feedback” you say
?
Something other than applause?
 More
slowly, I said, “Sure . . . that sounds
fine.”
I prepared a talk and on the appointed
day connected with Juliet and her boss,
the leader of TED, Chris Anderson.
Staring into the webcam, I delivered my
talk in the allotted time. Then I waited
for my effusive praise.
If there was any, I missed it.
Instead, what I got was Chris telling
me he’d gotten lost in all my scientific
jargon. Too many syllables. Too many
slides. And not enough clear,
understandable examples. Further, how
I’d come to this whole line of research
—my road from teacher to psychologist
—was unclear and unsatisfying. Juliet
agreed. She added that I’d managed to
tell a story with absolutely zero
suspense. The way I’d designed my talk
was like telling the punch line of a joke
at the very beginning.
Ouch! That bad, huh? Juliet and Chris
are busy people, and I knew I wouldn’t
get a second chance at getting coached.
So I forced myself to listen. Afterward, I
pondered who knew better how to give a
great talk on grit: them or me?
It didn’t take long to realize that
they
were the experienced storytellers, and I
was the scientist who needed feedback
to make her talk better.
So I rewrote the talk, practiced in
front of my family, and got more negative
feedback. “Why do you say ‘Um’ all the
time?” my older daughter, Amanda,
asked. “Yeah, why do you do that,
Mom?” my younger daughter, Lucy,
chimed in. “And you bite your lip when
you’re nervous. Don’t do that. It’s
distracting.”
More practice. More refinements.
Then the fateful day arrived. I gave a
talk that bore only a weak resemblance
to the one I’d originally proposed. It was
better. A
lot
 better.
Watch that talk and
you’ll see me in flow. Search YouTube
for the many rehearsals that preceded it
—or, for that matter, footage of
anyone
doing effortful, mistake-ridden,
repetitive deliberate practice—and my
guess is you’ll come up empty.
Nobody wants to show you the hours
and hours of becoming. They’d rather
show the highlight of what they’ve
become.
After it was all over, I rushed to meet
my husband and mother-in-law, who’d
been in the audience that day to cheer me
on. As soon as they were within earshot,
I called out preemptively: “Just the
effusive praise, please!” And they
delivered.
Lately, I’ve been asking gritty
performers and their coaches in diverse
fields to elaborate on how it feels to do
deliberate practice. Many agree with
dancer Martha Graham that attempting to
do what you cannot yet do is frustrating,
uncomfortable, and even painful.
However, some have suggested that,
in fact, the experience of deliberate
practice can be extremely positive—not
just in the long-term but in the moment.
Fun
 isn’t quite the word they use to
describe deliberate practice, but neither
is
bitter
. And, too, top performers point
out that the alternative to deliberate
practice—mindlessly “going through the
motions” without improvement—can be
its own form of suffering.
I puzzled over these observations for
a while, and then I decided to look back
at the diary data that Ericsson and I had
collected from the National Spelling Bee
finalists. While I knew that spellers
rated deliberate practice as especially
effortful and unenjoyable, I also recalled
that there was quite a spread around
these averages. In other words, not all
spellers had the same exact experience.
I looked to see how grittier
competitors experienced deliberate
practice. Compared to their less
passionate, less persevering
competitors, grittier spellers not only
logged more hours of deliberate
practice,
they rated it as both
more
enjoyable
 and
more effortful
. That’s
right. Grittier kids reported working
harder than other kids when doing
deliberate practice but, at the same time,
said they enjoyed it more than other kids,
too.
It’s hard to know for sure what to
make of this finding. One possibility is
that grittier kids spend more time doing
deliberate practice, and that, over the
years, they develop a taste for hard work
as they experience the rewards of their
labor. This is the “learn to love the
burn” story. Alternatively, it could be
that grittier kids enjoy the hard work
more, and that gets them to do more of it.
This is the “some people enjoy a
challenge” story.
I can’t tell you which of these
accounts is accurate, and if I had to
guess, I’d say there’s some truth to both.
As we’ll learn in chapter 11, there’s
solid scientific evidence that the
subjective experience of effort—what it
feels
 like to work hard—can and does
change when, for example, effort is
rewarded in some way. I’ve watched my
own daughters learn to enjoy working
hard more than they used to, and I can
say the same for myself.
On the other hand, Katie Ledecky’s
coach, Bruce Gemmell, says she’s
always
 relished a tough challenge.
“There’s a little video clip that
Katie’s parents have of one of her first
swim meets,” Bruce told me. “It’s just
one lap. She’s six years old. She swims
a few strokes and then grabs on to the
lane line. She swims a few more strokes
and grabs on to the lane line again.
Finally, she gets to the end of the pool
and gets out of the water. Dad’s filming
it, and he asks, ‘Tell me about your first
race. How was it?’ She goes, ‘Great!’ A
few seconds later, she adds, ‘That was
hard!’ And she’s beaming—a smile from
ear to ear. That says it all right there.
She has that attitude with everything we
do.”
In the same conversation, Bruce told
me that Katie willingly does more
deliberate practice than anyone he’s ever
met. “We’ll try a drill that she’s horrible
at—something where she’ll start off in
the poorest
third of the group doing it.
Then I’ll catch her sneaking practice
time to get better at it, so within some
period of time, she’s one of the best in
the group. Some other swimmers, well,
they try and they fail at it, and I have to
cajole and beg them to try it again.”
If deliberate practice can be
“awesome,” can it ever feel like
effortless flow?
When I asked spelling champ Kerry
Close if she’d ever experienced the state
of flow during deliberate practice, she
said, “No, the only time I could say that I
was in flow was when I wasn’t being
challenged.” At the same time, she
described deliberate practice as
gratifying in its own way: “Some of my
most
rewarding
 studying,” she told me,
“was on my own, forcing myself to
break down a big task into multiple parts
and getting it done.”
As of now, there isn’t enough
research to say whether deliberate
practice can be experienced as effortless
flow. My guess is that deliberate
practice can be deeply gratifying, but in
a different way than flow. In other
words, there are
different kinds
 of
positive experience: the thrill of getting
better is one, and the ecstasy of
performing at your best is another.
Other than getting yourself a terrific
coach, mentor, or teacher, how can you
get the most out of deliberate practice
and—because you’ve earned it—
experience more flow?
First,
know the science
.
Each of the
basic requirements of
deliberate practice is unremarkable:
•
 A clearly defined stretch goal
•
 Full concentration and effort
•
 Immediate and informative feedback
•
 Repetition with reflection and
refinement
But how many hours of practice do
most people accomplish that checks all
four
 of these boxes? My guess is that
many people are cruising through life
doing precisely
zero
 hours of daily
deliberate practice.
Even supermotivated people who’re
working to exhaustion may not be doing
deliberate practice. For instance, when a
Japanese rowing team invited Olympic
gold medalist Mads Rasmussen to come
visit, he was shocked at how many hours
of practice their athletes were logging.
It’s not hours of brute-force exhaustion
you’re after, he told them. It’s high-
quality, thoughtful training goals
pursued, just as Ericsson’s research has
shown, for just a few hours a day, tops.
Noa Kageyama, a performance
psychologist on the faculty of the
Juilliard School of Music, says he’s
been playing the violin since he was two
but didn’t really start practicing
deliberately
until he was twenty-two.
Why not? There was no lack of
motivation—at one point, young Noa
was taking lessons with four different
teachers and, literally, commuting to
three different cities to work with them
all. Really, the problem was just that
Noa didn’t know better. Once he
discovered there was an actual science
of practice—an approach that would
improve his skills more efficiently—
both the quality of his practice and his
satisfaction with his progress
skyrocketed. He’s now devoted himself
to sharing that knowledge with other
musicians.
A few years ago, my graduate student
Lauren Eskreis-Winkler and I decided to
teach kids about deliberate practice. We
put together self-guided lessons,
complete with cartoons and stories,
illustrating key differences between
deliberate practice and less effective
ways of studying. We explained that no
matter their initial talent, great
performers in every domain improve
through deliberate practice. We let
students know that hidden behind every
effortless performance on YouTube are
hours and hours of unrecorded,
invisible-to-outsiders,
challenging,
effortful, mistake-ridden practice. We
told them that trying to do things they
can’t yet do, failing, and learning what
they need to do differently is
exactly
 the
way experts practice. We helped them
understand that feelings of frustration
aren’t necessarily a sign they’re on the
wrong track. On the contrary, we told
them that wishing they did things better
is extremely common during learning.
We then tested this intervention against
different kinds of placebo control
activities.
What we found is that students can
change the way they think about practice
and achievement. For instance, asked
what advice they’d give to another
student on how to succeed in school,
students who learned about deliberate
practice were more likely to recommend
“focus on your weaknesses” and
“concentrate one hundred percent.”
Given the choice between doing
deliberate practice in math versus
entertaining themselves with social
media and gaming websites, they elected
to do more deliberate practice. And,
finally, in the case of those who’d been
performing at a below-average level in
class, learning about deliberate practice
increased their report card grades.
Which leads to my
second
 suggestion
for getting the most out of deliberate
practice:
Make it a habit
.
By this I mean, figure out when and
where you’re most comfortable doing
deliberate practice. Once you’ve made
your selection, do deliberate practice
then and there every day. Why? Because
routines are a godsend when it comes to
doing something hard. A mountain of
research studies, including a few of my
own, show that when you have a habit of
practicing at the same time and in the
same place every day, you hardly have
to think about getting started.
You just
do.
The book
Daily Rituals
 by Mason
Currey describes a day in the life of one
hundred sixty-one artists, scientists, and
other creators. If you look for a
particular rule, like
Always drink coffee
,
or
Never drink coffee
, or
Only work in
your bedroom
, or
Never work in your
bedroom
, you won’t find it. But if
instead you ask, “What do these creators
have in common?” you’ll find the
answer right in the title: daily rituals. In
their own particular way, all the experts
in this book consistently put in hours and
hours of solitary deliberate practice.
They follow routines. They’re creatures
of habit.
For instance, cartoonist Charles
Schulz, who drew almost eighteen
thousand
Peanuts
 comic strips in his
career,
rose at dawn, showered, shaved,
and had breakfast with his children. He
then drove his kids to school and went to
his studio, where he worked through
lunch (a ham sandwich and a glass of
milk) until his children returned from
school. Writer Maya Angelou’s routine
was to get up and have coffee with her
husband, and then, by seven in the
morning, deliver herself to a
“tiny mean”
hotel room with no distractions until two
in the afternoon.
Eventually, if you keep practicing in
the same time and place, what once took
conscious thought to initiate becomes
automatic. “There is no more miserable
human being,” observed William James,
than the one for whom “the
beginning of
every bit of work” must be decided
anew each day.
I myself learned that lesson quickly. I
now know what Joyce Carol Oates
meant when she likened completing the
first draft of a book to “pushing a peanut
across a very dirty kitchen floor
with
your nose.” So what’d I do? Here’s the
simple daily plan that helped me get
going:
When it’s eight in the morning
and I’m in my home office, I will reread
yesterday’s draft.
 This habit didn’t make
the writing easier, per se, but it sure
made it easier to get started.
My third suggestion for getting the
most out of deliberate practice is to
change the way you experience it
.
Around the time I was revisiting my
National Spelling Bee data and
discovering how much more enjoyable
the experience of deliberate practice is
for grittier competitors, I called up a
swimming coach named Terry Laughlin.
Terry has coached every level of
swimmer, from complete newbie to
Olympic champion, and broken records
himself in open-water Masters
swimming. I was particularly interested
in his perspective because he’s long
advocated what he calls a “total
immersion” approach to swimming—
essentially a relaxed, mindful approach
to gliding through the water.
“Deliberate practice can feel
wonderful,” Terry told me. “If you try,
you can learn to embrace challenge
rather than fear it. You can do all the
things you’re supposed to do during
deliberate practice—a clear goal,
feedback, all of it—and still
feel great
while you’re doing it.
“It’s all about in-the-moment self-
awareness
without judgment
,” he
continued. “It’s about relieving yourself
of the judgment that gets in the way of
enjoying the challenge.”
After hanging up with Terry, I began
to think about the fact that infants and
toddlers spend most of their time trying
to do things they can’t, again and again
—and yet they don’t seem especially
embarrassed or anxious.
No pain, no
gain
 is a rule that doesn’t seem to apply
to the preschool set.
Elena Bodrova and Deborah Leong,
psychologists who’ve devoted their
careers to studying how children learn,
agree that learning from mistakes is
something babies and
toddlers don’t
mind at all. Watch a baby struggle to sit
up, or a toddler learn to walk: you’ll see
one error after another, failure after
failure, a lot of challenge exceeding
skill, a lot of concentration, a lot of
feedback, a lot of learning. Emotionally?
Well, they’re too young to ask, but very
young children don’t seem tortured
while they’re trying to do things they
can’t yet do.
And then . . . something changes.
According to Elena and Deborah, around
the time children enter kindergarten, they
begin to notice that their mistakes inspire
certain reactions in grown-ups. What do
we do? We frown. Our cheeks flush a
bit. We rush over to our little ones to
point out that they’ve done something
wrong
. And what’s the lesson we’re
teaching? Embarrassment. Fear. Shame.
Coach Bruce Gemmell says that’s
exactly what happens to many of his
swimmers: “Between coaches and
parents and friends and the media,
they’ve learned that failing is
bad
, so
they protect themselves and won’t stick
their neck out and
give their best effort.”
“Shame doesn’t help you fix
anything,” Deborah told me.
So what’s to be done?
Elena and Deborah ask teachers to
model
 emotion-free mistake
making.
They actually instruct teachers to commit
an error on purpose and then let students
see them say, with a smile, “Oh, gosh, I
thought there were
five
 blocks in this
pile! Let me count again! One . . .
two . . . three . . . four . . . five . . .
six
!
There are
six
 blocks! Great! I learned I
need to touch each block as I count!”
Whether you can make deliberate
practice as ecstatic as flow, I don’t
know, but I do think you can try saying to
yourself, and to others, “That was hard!
It was great!”
I
. This means swimming one hundred meters in
one minute and fifteen seconds, and then trying
to do the same in one minute and fourteen
seconds, and so on.

years, Mihaly has gone by “Mike.”

# Purpose
Interest is one source of passion.
Purpose—the intention to contribute to
the well-being of others—is another.
The mature passions of gritty people
depend on both.
For some, purpose comes first. This
is the only way I can understand a
paragon of grit like Alex Scott. Ever
since Alex could remember, she’d been
sick. Her neuroblastoma had been
diagnosed when she was a year old.
Shortly after her fourth birthday, Alex
told her mother, “When I get out of the
hospital, I want to
have a lemonade
stand.” And she did. She operated her
first lemonade stand before she turned
five, raising two thousand dollars for her
doctors to “help other kids, like they
helped me.” When Alex passed away
four years later, she’d inspired so many
people to create their own lemonade
stands that she’d raised more than a
million dollars. Alex’s family has
continued her legacy, and to date, Alex’s
Lemonade Stand Foundation has raised
more than one hundred million dollars
for cancer research.
Alex was extraordinary. But most
people first become attracted to things
they enjoy and only later appreciate how
these personal interests might also
benefit others. In other words, the more
common sequence is to start out with a
relatively self-oriented interest, then
learn self-disciplined practice, and,
finally, integrate that work with an other-
centered purpose.
The psychologist Benjamin Bloom
was among the first to notice
this three-
phase progression.
Thirty years ago, when Bloom set out
to interview world-class athletes,
artists, mathematicians, and scientists, he
knew he’d learn something about how
people reach the top of their fields. What
he didn’t foresee was that he’d discover
a general model of learning that applied
to all the fields he studied. Despite
superficial differences in their
upbringing and training, all the
extraordinary people in Bloom’s study
had progressed through three distinct
periods of development. We discussed
what Bloom called the “early years” in
chapter 6 on interest and “the middle
years” in chapter 7 on practice. We’ve
now come to the third, final, and longest
phase in Bloom’s model—the “later
years”—when, as he put it, “
the larger
purpose and meaning” of work finally
becomes apparent.
When I talk to grit paragons, and they
tell me that what they’re pursuing has
purpose
, they mean something much
deeper than mere intention. They’re not
just goal-oriented; the nature of their
goals is special.
When I probe, asking, “Can you tell
me more? What do you mean?” there
sometimes follows an earnest, stumbling
struggle to put how they feel into words.
But always—always—those next
sentences mention other people.
Sometimes it’s very particular (“my
children,” “my clients,” “my students”)
and sometimes quite abstract (“this
country,” “the sport,” “science,”
“society”). However they say it, the
message is the same: the long days and
evenings of toil, the setbacks and
disappointments and struggle, the
sacrifice—all this is worth it because,
ultimately, their efforts pay dividends to
other people
.
At its core, the idea of purpose is the
idea that what we do matters to people
other than ourselves.
A precocious altruist like Alex Scott
is an easy-to-fathom example of other-
centered purpose.
So is art activist Jane Golden, the grit
paragon we met in chapter 6. Interest in
art led Jane to become a muralist in Los
Angeles after graduating from college. In
her late twenties, Jane was diagnosed
with lupus and told she didn’t have long
to live. “The news came as such a
shock,” she told me. “It gave me a
new
perspective on life.” When Jane
recovered from the disease’s most acute
symptoms, she realized she would
outlive the doctors’ initial predictions,
but with chronic pain.
Moving back to her hometown of
Philadelphia, she took over a small anti-
graffiti program in the mayor’s office
and, over the next three decades, grew it
into one of the largest public art
programs in the world.
Now in her late fifties, Jane continues
to work from early morning to late in the
evening, six or seven days a week. One
colleague likens working with her to
running a campaign office the night
before an election—except
Election Day
never comes. For Jane, those hours
translate into more murals and programs,
and that means more opportunities for
people in the community to create and
experience art.
When I asked Jane about her lupus,
she admitted, matter-of-factly, that pain
is a constant companion. She once told a
journalist: “There are moments when I
cry. I think I just can’t do it anymore,
push that boulder up the hill. But feeling
sorry for myself is pointless,
so I find
ways to get energized.” Why? Because
her work is interesting? That’s only the
beginning of Jane’s motivation.
“Everything I do is in a spirit of
service,” she told me. “I feel driven by
it.
It’s a moral imperative.” Putting it
more succinctly, she said: “Art saves
lives.”
Other grit paragons have top-level
goals that are purposeful in less obvious
ways.
Renowned wine critic Antonio
Galloni, for instance, told me: “An
appreciation for wine is something I’m
passionate about sharing with other
people. When I walk into a restaurant, I
want to see a
beautiful bottle of wine on
every table.”
Antonio says his mission is “to help
people understand their own palates.”
When that happens, he says, it’s like a
lightbulb goes off, and he wants “to
make
a million lightbulbs go off.”
So, while interest for Antonio came
first—his parents owned a food and
wine shop while he was growing up, and
he “was always fascinated by wine,
even at a young age”—his passion is
very much enhanced by the idea of
helping other people: “I’m not a brain
surgeon, I’m not curing cancer. But in
this one small way, I think I’m going to
make the world better. I wake up every
morning with a
sense of purpose.”
In my “grit lexicon,” therefore,
purpose
 means “the intention to
contribute to the
well-being of others.”
After hearing, repeatedly, from grit
paragons how deeply connected they felt
their work was to other people, I
decided to analyze that connection more
closely. Sure, purpose might matter, but
how
much
 does it matter, relative to
other priorities? It seemed possible that
single-minded focus on a top-level goal
is, in fact, typically more
selfish
 than
selfless
.
Aristotle was among the first to
recognize that there are at least two
ways to pursue happiness. He called one
“eudaimonic”—in harmony with one’s
good (
eu
) inner spirit (
daemon
)—and
the other “hedonic”—aimed at positive,
in-the-moment, inherently self-centered
experiences. Aristotle clearly took a
side on the issue, deeming the hedonic
life primitive and vulgar, and upholding
the eudaimonic life as noble and pure.
But, in fact, both of these two
approaches to happiness have very deep
evolutionary roots.
On one hand, human beings seek
pleasure because, by and large,
the
things that bring us pleasure are those
that increase our chances of survival. If
our ancestors hadn’t craved food and
sex, for example, they wouldn’t have
lived very long or had many offspring.
To some extent, all of us are, as Freud
put it, driven by the “
pleasure
principle.”
On the other hand, human beings have
evolved to seek meaning and purpose. In
the most profound way, we’re social
creatures. Why? Because the drive to
connect with and serve others
also
promotes survival. How? Because
people who cooperate are more likely to
survive than loners. Society depends on
stable interpersonal relationships, and
society in so many ways keeps us fed,
shelters us from the elements, and
protects us from enemies. The desire to
connect is as basic a human need as our
appetite for pleasure.
To some extent, we’re
all
 hardwired
to pursue both hedonic and eudaimonic
happiness. But the
relative
 weight we
give these two kinds of pursuits can
vary. Some of us care about purpose
much more
than we care about pleasure,
and vice versa.
To probe the motivations that underlie
grit, I recruited sixteen thousand
American adults and asked them to
complete the Grit Scale. As part of a
long supplementary questionnaire, study
participants read statements about
purpose
—for instance, “What I do
matters to society”—and indicated the
extent to which each applied to them.
They did the same for six statements
about the importance of
pleasure
—for
instance, “For me, the good life is the
pleasurable life.” From these responses,
we generated scores ranging from 1 to 5
for their orientations to purpose and
pleasure, respectively.
Below, I’ve plotted the data from this
large-scale study. As you can see, gritty
people aren’t monks, nor are they
hedonists. In terms of pleasure-seeking,
they’re just like anyone else; pleasure is
moderately important no matter how
gritty you are. In sharp contrast, you can
see that grittier people are
dramatically
more motivated than others to seek a
meaningful, other-centered life. Higher
scores on purpose correlate with
higher
scores on the Grit Scale.
This is not to say that all grit
paragons are saints, but rather, that most
gritty people see their ultimate aims as
deeply connected to the world beyond
themselves.
My claim here is that, for most
people, purpose is a tremendously
powerful source of motivation. There
may be exceptions, but the rarity of these
exceptions proves the rule.
What am I missing?
Well, it’s unlikely that my sample
included many terrorists or serial
killers. And it’s true that I haven’t
interviewed political despots or Mafia
bosses. I guess you could argue that I’m
overlooking a whole population of grit
paragons whose goals are purely selfish
or, worse, directed at harming others.
On this point, I concede. Partly. In
theory, you can be a misanthropic,
misguided paragon of grit. Joseph Stalin
and Adolf Hitler, for instance, were
most certainly gritty. They also prove
that the idea of purpose can be
perverted. How many millions of
innocent people have
perished at the
hands of demagogues whose
stated
intention was to contribute to the well-
being of others?
In other words, a genuinely positive,
altruistic purpose is not an absolute
requirement of grit. And I have to admit
that, yes, it is possible to be a gritty
villain.
But, on the whole, I take the survey
data I’ve gathered, and what paragons of
grit tell me in person, at face value. So,
while interest is crucial to sustaining
passion over the long-term, so, too, is
the desire to connect with and help
others.
My guess is that, if you take a moment
to reflect on the times in your life when
you’ve really been at your best—when
you’ve risen to the challenges before
you, finding strength to do what might
have seemed impossible—you’ll realize
that the goals you achieved were
connected in some way, shape, or form
to the
benefit of other people
.
In sum, there may be gritty villains in
the world, but my research suggests
there are many more gritty heroes.
Fortunate indeed are those who have a
top-level goal so consequential to the
world that it imbues everything they do,
no matter how small or tedious, with
significance. Consider the parable of the
bricklayers:
Three bricklayers are asked: “What
are you doing?”
The first says, “I am laying bricks.”
The second says, “I am building a
church.”
And the third says, “I am building the
house of God.”
The first bricklayer has a job. The
second has a career. The third has a
calling.
Many of us would like to be like the
third bricklayer, but instead identify with
the first or second.
Yale management professor Amy
Wrzesniewski has found that people
have no trouble at all telling her
which
of the three bricklayers
they identify
with. In about equal numbers, workers
identify themselves as having:
a job (“I view my job as just a
necessity of life, much like
breathing or sleeping”),
a career (“I view my job primarily
as a stepping-stone to other
jobs”), or
a calling (“My work is one of the
most important things in my
life”).
Using Amy’s measures, I, too, have
found that only a minority of workers
consider
their occupations a calling. Not
surprisingly, those who do are
significantly grittier than those who feel
that “job” or “career” more aptly
describes their work.
Those fortunate people who do see
their work as a calling—as opposed to a
job or a career—reliably say “my work
makes the world a better place.” And
it’s these people who seem most
satisfied with their jobs and their lives
overall. In one study, adults who felt
their work was a calling missed at least
a third fewer days of work
than those
with a job or a career.
Likewise, a recent
survey of 982
zookeepers—who belong to a profession
in which 80 percent of workers have
college degrees and yet on average earn
a salary of $25,000—found that those
who identified their work as a calling
(“Working with animals feels like my
calling in life”) also expressed a deep
sense of purpose (“The work that I do
makes the world a better place”).
Zookeepers with a calling were also
more willing to sacrifice unpaid time,
after hours, to care for sick animals. And
it was zookeepers with a calling who
expressed a sense of moral duty (“I have
a moral obligation to give my animals
the best possible care”).
I’ll point out the obvious: there’s nothing
“wrong” with having no professional
ambition other than to make an honest
living. But most of us yearn for much
more. This was the conclusion of
journalist Studs Terkel, who in the 1970s
interviewed more than a hundred
working adults in all sorts of
professions.
Not surprisingly, Terkel found that
only a small minority of workers
identified their work as a calling. But it
wasn’t for lack of wanting. All of us,
Terkel concluded, are looking for “daily
meaning as well as daily bread . . . for a
sort of life rather than a
Monday through
Friday sort of dying.”
The despair of spending the majority
of our waking hours doing something that
lacks purpose is vividly embodied in the
story of Nora Watson, a twenty-eight-
year-old staff writer for an institution
publishing health-care information:
“Most of us are looking for a calling, not
a job,” she told Terkel. “There’s nothing
I would enjoy more than a job that was
so meaningful to me that I brought it
home.” And yet, she admitted to doing
about two hours of real work a day and
spending the rest of the time pretending
to work. “I’m the only person in the
whole damn building with a desk facing
the window instead of the door. I just
turn myself around from all that I can.
“
I don’t think I have a calling—at this
moment—except to be me,” Nora said
toward the end of her interview. “But
nobody pays you for being you, so I’m at
the Institution—for the moment. . . .”
In the course of his research, Terkel
did meet a “happy few who
find a savor
in their daily job.” From an outsider’s
point of view, those with a calling didn’t
always labor in professions more
conducive to purpose than Nora. One
was a stonemason, another a bookbinder.
A fifty-eight-year-old garbage collector
named Roy Schmidt told Terkel that his
job was exhausting, dirty, and
dangerous. He knew most other
occupations, including his previous
office job, would be considered more
attractive to most people. And yet, he
said: “I don’t look down on my job in
any way. . . .
It’s meaningful to society.”
Contrast Nora’s closing words with
the ending of Roy’s interview: “I was
told a story one time by a doctor. Years
ago, in France . . . if you didn’t stand in
favor with the king, they’d give you the
lowest job, of cleaning the streets of
Paris—which must have been a mess in
those days. One lord goofed up
somewhere along the line, so they put
him in charge of it. And he did such a
wonderful job that he was commended
for it. The worst job in the French
kingdom and he was patted on the back
for what he did. That was the first story I
ever heard about garbage where it really
meant
 something.”
In the parable of the bricklayers,
everyone has the same occupation, but
their subjective experience—how they
themselves
viewed
 their work—couldn’t
be more different.
Likewise, Amy’s research suggests
that callings have little to do with formal
job descriptions. In fact, she believes
that just about
any
 occupation can be a
job, career, or calling. For instance,
when she studied secretaries, she
initially expected very few to identify
their work as a calling. When her data
came back, she found that secretaries
identified themselves as having a job,
career, or calling in equal numbers—just
about the same proportion she’d
identified in other samples.
Amy’s conclusion is that it’s not that
some kinds of occupations are
necessarily jobs and others are careers
and still others are callings. Instead,
what matters is whether the person doing
the work
believes
 that laying down the
next brick is just something that has to be
done, or instead something that will lead
to further personal success, or, finally,
work that connects the individual to
something far greater than the self.
I agree. How you
see
 your work is
more important than your job title.
And this means that you can go from
job to career to calling—all without
changing your occupation.
“What do you tell people,” I recently
asked Amy, “when they ask you for
advice?”
“A lot of people assume that what
they need to do is
find
 their calling,” she
said. “I think a lot of anxiety comes from
the assumption that your calling is like a
magical entity that exists in the world,
waiting to be discovered.”
That’s also how people mistakenly
think about interests, I pointed out. They
don’t realize they need to play an active
role in
developing and deepening
 their
interests.
“A calling is not some fully formed
thing that you find,” she tells advice
seekers. “It’s much more dynamic.
Whatever you do—whether you’re a
janitor or the CEO—you can continually
look at what you do and ask how it
connects to other people, how it
connects to the bigger picture, how it can
be an expression of your deepest
values.”
In other words, a bricklayer who one
day says, “I am laying bricks” might at
some point
become
 the bricklayer who
recognizes “I am building the house of
God.”
Amy’s observation that the same
individual in the same occupation can at
different times think of it as a job,
career, or calling brought to mind Joe
Leader.
Joe is a senior vice president at NYC
Transit. Basically, he’s the New York
City subway’s lead engineer. It’s a task
of almost unimaginable proportions.
Annually, more than 1.7 billion trips are
taken on the city’s subways, making it
the busiest subway system in the United
States. There are 469 stations. Laid end
to end, the tracks for the subway system
would reach
all the way to Chicago.
As a young man, Leader wasn’t
looking for a calling. He was looking to
pay back student loans.
“When I was coming out of college,”
he told me, “my biggest
concern was just
getting a job. Any job. Transit came to
our campus to recruit engineers,
and I
got hired.”
As an intern, Leader was assigned to
work on the tracks. “I threw in rails, I
was pulling ties, I was doing cable work
for the third rail.”
Not everyone would find that work
interesting, but Joe did. “It was fun.
When I was first on the job, and all my
buddies were business or computer
guys, we used to go out, and on the way
home from the bars in the evening, they
used to run up and down a platform and
say, ‘Joe, what’s this, what’s this?’ I
used to tell them: that’s a third-rail
insulator, that’s an insulated joint. To me,
it was fun.”
So, interest was the seed of his
passion.
Joe soon ended up doing a lot of
planning work, which he also enjoyed.
As his interests and expertise deepened,
and he started to distinguish himself, he
began to see transit engineering as a
long-term career. “On my days off, I
went down to the laundromat to do the
laundry. You know those big tables for
folding your clothes? Well, all the
women used to laugh because I’d bring
my engineering drawings and lay them
out and work on them. I really fell in
love with that part of the job.”
Within a year, Joe said he began to
look at his work differently. Sometimes,
he’d look at a bolt or rivet and realize
that some fellow had put that in decades
ago, and here it was, still in the same
place, still making the trains run, still
helping people to get where they needed
to be.
“I began to feel like I was making a
contribution to society,” he told me. “I
understood I was responsible for moving
people every single day. And when I
became a project manager, I would walk
away from these big installation jobs—
you know, a hundred panels or a whole
interlocking [of signals]—and I knew
that what we’d done was going to last
for thirty years. That was when I felt I
had a vocation, or I would say, a
calling.”
To hear Joe Leader talk about his work
might make you wonder if, after a year
of not finding your work to be a calling,
you should give up hope. Among her
MBA students, Amy Wrzesniewski finds
that many give their job only a couple of
years before concluding that it couldn’t
possibly be their life’s passion.
It may comfort you to know that it
took Michael Baime much longer.
Baime is a professor of internal
medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania. You might think his calling
is to heal and to teach. That’s only partly
right. Michael’s passion is well-being
through mindfulness. It took him years to
integrate his personal interest in
mindfulness with the other-centered
purpose of helping people lead healthier,
happier lives. Only when interest and
purpose melded did he feel like he was
doing what he’d been put on this planet
to do.
I asked Michael how he got interested
in mindfulness, and he took me all the
way back to his boyhood. “I was looking
up at the sky,” he told me. “And the
strangest thing happened. I felt like I was
actually getting lost in the sky. I felt it as
a sort of opening, like I was becoming
much larger. It was the most wonderful
experience I’ve ever had.”
Later, Michael found that he could
make the same thing happen just by
paying attention to his own thoughts. “I
became obsessed,” he told me. “I didn’t
know what to call it, but I would do it
all the time.”
Several years later, Michael was
browsing in a bookstore with his mother
when he came upon a book that
described his experience exactly. The
book was by Alan Watts, a British
philosopher who wrote about meditation
for Western audiences long before it
became fashionable.
With his parents’ encouragement,
Michael took classes in meditation
throughout high school and college. As
graduation approached, he
had to decide
what to do next.
Professional meditator
was not an actual full-time occupation.
He decided to become a doctor.
Several years into medical school,
Michael confessed to one of his
meditation teachers, “This isn’t really
what I want to do. This isn’t right for
me.” Medicine was important, but it
didn’t match up with his deepest
personal interests. “Stay,” said the
teacher. “You’ll help more people if you
become a doctor.”
Michael stayed.
After finishing his coursework,
Michael says, “I didn’t really know what
I wanted to do. To kind of tread water, I
just signed up for the first year of
internship.”
To his surprise, he enjoyed practicing
medicine. “It was a fine way to be
helpful to people. It wasn’t like medical
school, which isn’t so much about
helping people as cutting apart cadavers
and memorizing the Krebs cycle.”
Rapidly, he progressed from intern to
fellow to running the medical clinic to
becoming the assistant director of
residency and, finally, chief of general
internal medicine.
Still, medicine wasn’t quite what
Michael would consider a calling.
“As I practiced, I realized that the
thing many of my patients really needed
wasn’t another prescription or X-ray, but
actually what I’d been doing for myself
since I was a kid. What many patients
needed was to stop and breathe and fully
connect with their lived experience.”
That realization led Michael to create
a meditation class for patients with
serious health conditions. That was in
1992. Since then, he’s expanded the
program and, just this year, taken it on as
a full-time occupation. To date, about
fifteen thousand patients, nurses, and
physicians have been trained.
Recently, I asked Michael to give a
lecture on mindfulness for local
schoolteachers. On the day of his talk, he
stepped up to the podium and looked
intently at his audience. One by one, he
made eye contact with each of the
seventy educators who’d given up their
Sunday afternoon to hear what he had to
say. There was a long pause.
And then, with a smile I can only
describe as radiant, he began: “I have a
calling.”
I was twenty-one when I first
experienced the power of a
purposeful
top-level goal.
In the spring of my junior year in
college, I went to the career services
center to find something to do that
summer. Turning the pages of an
enormous three-ring binder labeled
# Summer Public Service
, I came across
a program called Summerbridge. The
program was looking for college
students to design and teach summer
enrichment classes for middle school
students from disadvantaged
backgrounds.
Teaching kids for a summer sounds
like a good idea
, I thought.
I could teach
biology and ecology. I’ll show them
how to make a solar oven out of tinfoil
and cardboard. We’ll roast hot dogs.
It’ll be fun.
I didn’t think,
This experience is
going to change everything.
I didn’t think,
Sure, you’re premed
now, but not for long.
I didn’t think,
Hold on tight—you’re
about to discover the power of purpose.
To be honest, I can’t tell you much
about that summer. The details escape
me. I do know I woke long before dawn
each day, including weekends, to
prepare for my classes. I do know I
worked long into the night. I remember
specific kids, and certain moments. But
it wasn’t until I returned home and had a
moment to reflect that I realized what
had happened. I’d glimpsed the
possibility that a child’s connection with
a teacher can be life-changing—for both.
When I returned to campus that fall, I
sought out other students who’d taught at
Summerbridge programs. One of these
students, Philip King, happened to live
in the same dorm. Like me, he felt a
palpable urgency to start another
Summerbridge program. The idea was
too compelling. We
couldn’t not
 try.
We had no money, no idea how to
start a nonprofit, no connections,
and, in
my case, nothing but skepticism and
worry from parents convinced this was a
catastrophically stupid way to use a
Harvard education.
Philip and I had nothing and, yet, we
had exactly what we needed. We had
purpose.
As anyone who has started an
organization from scratch can tell you,
there are a million tasks, big and small,
and no instruction manual for any of
them. If Philip and I were doing
something that was merely interesting,
we couldn’t have done it at all. But
because creating this program was in our
minds—and in our
hearts
—so
overwhelmingly important for kids, it
gave us a courage and energy neither of
us had ever known before.
Because we weren’t asking for
ourselves, Philip and I found the
gumption to knock on the doors of just
about every small business and
restaurant in Cambridge, asking for
donations. We found the patience to sit in
countless waiting rooms of powers-that-
be. We waited and waited, sometimes
hours on end, until these authority figures
had time to see us. Then we found the
stubbornness to keep asking and asking
until we secured what we needed.
And so it went for everything we had
to do—because we weren’t doing it for
ourselves, we were doing it for a greater
cause.
Two weeks after Philip and I
graduated, we opened the doors to the
program. That summer, seven high
school and college students discovered
what it was like to be a teacher. Thirty
fifth-grade boys and girls discovered
what it was like to spend their summer
vacation learning, studying, working
hard, and—though it may have seemed
impossible before they actually did it
—
having fun at the same time.
That was more than twenty years ago.
Now called Breakthrough Greater
Boston, the program has grown far
beyond what Philip and I could have
imagined, providing tuition-free, year-
round academic enrichment for
hundreds
of students every year. To date, more
than a
thousand young men and women
have taught in the program, many of
whom have gone on to pursue full-time
careers in education.
Summerbridge led me to pursue
teaching. Teaching led me to an enduring
interest in helping children do so much
more with their lives than they might
ever dream possible.
And yet . . .
For me, teaching wasn’t enough. Still
unfulfilled was the little girl in me who
loved science, who was fascinated by
human nature, who, when she was
sixteen and had a chance to take a
summer enrichment class, picked—of all
the courses in the catalog—psychology.
Writing this book made me realize
that I’m someone who had an inkling
about my interests in adolescence, then
some clarity about purpose in my
twenties, and finally, in my thirties, the
experience and expertise to say that my
top-level, life-organizing goal is, and
will be until my last breath:
Use
psychological science to help kids
thrive
.
One reason my dad was so upset about
Summerbridge is that he loves me. He
thought I would sacrifice my welfare for
the well-being of other people who,
frankly, he didn’t love as much as his
own daughter.
Indeed, the concepts of grit and
purpose might, in principle, seem to
conflict. How is it possible to stay
narrowly focused on your own top-level
goal while also having the peripheral
vision to worry about anyone else? If
grit is about having a pyramid of goals
that all serve a single personal
objective, how do
other people
 fit into
the picture?
“Most people think self-oriented and
other-oriented motivations are opposite
ends of a continuum,” says my colleague
and Wharton professor Adam Grant.
“Yet, I’ve consistently found that they’re
completely independent. You can have
neither, and
you can have both.” In other
words, you can want to be a top dog and,
at the same time, be driven to help
others.
Adam’s research demonstrates that
leaders and employees who keep both
personal
and

prosocial interests in mind
do better in the long run than those who
are 100 percent selfishly motivated.
For instance, Adam once asked
municipal firefighters, “Why are you
motivated to do your work?” He then
tracked their overtime hours over the
next two months, expecting firefighters
who were more motivated to help others
to demonstrate the greatest grit. But
many of those who were driven to help
others worked
fewer
 overtime hours.
Why?
A second motivation was missing:
interest in the work itself. Only when
they enjoyed the work did the desire to
help others result in more effort. In fact,
firefighters who expressed prosocial
motives (“Because I want to help others
through my work”)
and
 intrinsic interest
in their work (“Because I enjoy it”)
averaged more than 50 percent more
overtime per week than others.
When Adam asked the same question
—“Why are you motivated to do your
work?”—of 140 fund-raisers at a call
center for a public university, he found
nearly identical results. Only the fund-
raisers who expressed stronger
prosocial motives
and
 who found the
work intrinsically engaging made more
calls and, in turn,
raised more money for
the university.
Developmental psychologists David
Yeager and Matt Bundick find the same
pattern of results in adolescents. For
example, in one study, David
interviewed
about a hundred
adolescents, asking them to tell him, in
their own words, what they wanted to be
when they grew up, and why.
Some talked about their future in
purely self-oriented terms (“I want to be
a fashion designer because it’s a fun
thing to do. . . . What’s important . . . is
that you really enjoy [your career]”).
Others only mentioned other-oriented
motives (“I want to be a doctor. I want
to help people out . . .”).
And, finally, some adolescents
mentioned both self-
and
 other-oriented
motives: “If I was a marine biologist, I
would push [to] keep
everything
clean. . . . I would pick a certain place
and go help that place out, like the fish
and everything. . . . I’ve always loved
having fish tanks and fish because they
get to swim and it’s, like, free. It’s like
flying underwater or something.”
Two years later, young people who’d
mentioned
both
 self- and other-oriented
motives rated their schoolwork as more
personally meaningful than classmates
who’d named either motive alone.
For many of the grit paragons I’ve
interviewed, the road to a purposeful,
interesting passion was unpredictable.
Aurora and Franco Fonte are
Australian entrepreneurs whose
facilities services company has 2,500
employees and generates more than $130
million in annual revenue.
Twenty-seven years ago, Aurora and
Franco were newly married and dead
broke. They got the idea to start a
restaurant but didn’t have enough money
to launch one. Instead, they began
cleaning shopping malls and small office
buildings—not out of any sense of
calling, but because it paid the bills.
Soon enough, their career ambitions
took a turn. They could see a brighter
future in building maintenance than in
hospitality. They both worked
ferociously hard, putting in eighty-hour
weeks, sometimes with their infant
children in carriers strapped across their
chests, scrubbing the bathroom tiles in
their customers’ buildings as if they
were their own.
Through all the ups and downs—and
there were many—Franco told me: “We
always persevered. We
didn’t give in to
obstacles. There was no way were going
to let ourselves fail.”
I confessed to Aurora and Franco that
it was hard for me to imagine how
cleaning bathrooms—or even building a
multimillion-dollar corporation that
cleans bathrooms—could feel like a
calling.
“It’s not about the cleaning,” Aurora
explained, her voice tightening
with
emotion. “It’s about building something.
It’s about our clients and solving their
problems. Most of all, it’s about the
incredible people we employ—they
have the biggest souls, and we feel a
huge responsibility toward them.”
According to Stanford developmental
psychologist Bill Damon, such a
beyond-the-self orientation can and
should be deliberately cultivated. Now
in the fifth decade of his distinguished
career, Bill studies how adolescents
learn to lead lives that are personally
gratifying and, at the same time,
beneficial to the larger community. The
study of purpose, he says, is his calling.
In Bill’s words, purpose is a final
answer to the question “
Why? Why
 are
you doing this?”
What has Bill learned about the
origins of purpose?
“In data set after data set,” he told
me, “there’s a pattern. Everyone has a
spark. And that’s the very beginning of
purpose. That spark is
something you’re
interested in.”
Next, you need to observe someone
who is purposeful. The purposeful role
model could be a family member, a
historical figure, a political figure. It
doesn’t really matter who it is, and it
doesn’t even matter whether that purpose
is related to what the child will end up
doing. “What matters,” Bill explained,
“is that
someone
 demonstrates that it’s
possible to accomplish something on
behalf of others.”
In fact, he can’t remember a single
case in which the development of
purpose unfolded without the earlier
observation of a purposeful role model.
“Ideally,” he said, “the child really gets
to see how difficult a life of purpose is
—all the frustrations and the obstacles—
but also how gratifying, ultimately, it can
be.”
What follows is a revelation, as Bill
put it. The person discovers a problem
in the world that needs solving. This
discovery can come
in many ways.
Sometimes from
personal loss or
adversity. Sometimes from learning
about the loss and adversity confronting
others.
But seeing that someone needs our
help isn’t enough, Bill hastened to add.
Purpose requires a second revelation: “I
personally
 can make a difference.” This
conviction, this intention to take action,
he says, is why it’s so important to have
observed a role model enact purpose in
their own life. “You have to believe that
your efforts will not be in vain.”
Kat Cole is someone who had a role
model for purpose-driven grit.
I met Kat when she was the thirty-
five-year-old president of the Cinnabon
bakery chain. If you listen to her story
without reflecting much on it, you might
dub it “rags to riches,” but if you lean in
and pay attention you’ll hear a different
theme: “from poverty to purpose.”
Kat grew up in Jacksonville, Florida.
Her mother, Jo, worked up the courage
to leave Kat’s alcoholic father when Kat
was nine. Jo worked three jobs to make
enough money to support Kat and her
two sisters, and yet still found time to be
a giver. “She’d be baking for someone,
running an errand for someone—she
intuitively saw every small opportunity
to do something for others. Everyone she
got to know, whether they were
coworkers or just people in the
community,
became family to her.”
Kat emulated both her mother’s work
ethic and her profound desire to be
helpful.
Before we get to Kat’s motivation,
though, let’s consider her unlikely ascent
up the corporate ladder. Kat’s résumé
begins with a stint, at age fifteen, selling
clothes at the local mall. At eighteen, she
was old enough to waitress. She got a
job as a “Hooters girl” and one year
later was asked to help open the first
Hooters restaurant in Australia. Ditto for
Mexico City, the Bahamas, and then
Argentina. By twenty-two,
she was
running a department of ten. By twenty-
six, she was vice president. As a
member of the executive team, Kat
helped expand the Hooters franchise to
more than four hundred sites in twenty-
eight countries. When the company was
bought by a private equity firm, Kat, at
age thirty-two, had such an impressive
track record that Cinnabon recruited her
to be its president. Under Kat’s watch,
Cinnabon sales grew faster than they had
in more than a decade, and within four
years
exceeded one billion dollars.
Now let’s consider what makes Kat
tick.
One time early in Kat’s waitressing
days at Hooters, the cooks quit in the
middle of their shift. “So,” she told me
matter-of-factly, “I went back with the
manager and helped cook the food so all
the tables got served.”
Why?
“First of all, I was surviving off tips.
That’s how I paid my bills. If people
didn’t get their food, they wouldn’t pay
their check, and they certainly wouldn’t
leave a tip. Second, I was so curious to
see if I could do it. And third, I wanted
to be helpful.”
Tips and curiosity are pretty self-
oriented motivations, but wanting to be
helpful is, quite literally, other-oriented.
Here was an example of how a single
action—jumping behind the stove to
make food for all those waiting
customers—benefited the individual
and
the people around her.
The next thing Kat knew, she was
training kitchen employees and helping
out with the back-office operations.
“Then one day, the bartender needed to
leave early, and the same thing
happened. Another day, the manager
quit, and I learned how to run a shift. In
the course of six months, I’d worked
every job in the building. Not only did I
work those jobs, I became the trainer to
help teach all those roles to other
people.”
Jumping into the breach and being
especially helpful wasn’t a calculated
move to get ahead in the corporation.
Nevertheless, that
beyond-the-call-of-
duty performance led to an invitation to
help open international locations, which
led to a corporate executive position,
and so on.
Not so coincidentally, it’s the sort of
thing her mother, Jo, would have done.
“
My passion is to help people,” Jo told
me. “No matter at business, or away
from business, if you need somebody to
come over and build something, or help
out in some way, I’m that person who
wants to be there for you. To me, any
success I’ve had, it’s because I love to
share. There’s no reserve in me—
whatever I have, I’m willing to give to
you or anyone else.”
Kat attributes her philosophy to her
mother, who raised her “to work hard
and give back.” And that ethic still
guides her today.
“Gradually, I became more and more
aware that I was very good at going into
new environments and helping people
realize they’re capable of more than they
know. I was discovering that this was
my thing. And I started to realize that if I
could help people—individuals—do
that, then I could help teams. If I could
help teams, I could help companies. If I
could help companies, I could help
brands. If I could help brands, I could
help communities and countries.”
Not long ago, Kat posted an essay on
her blog, titled “See What’s Possible,
and Help Others Do the Same.” “When I
am around people,” Kat wrote, “my
heart and soul radiate with the
awareness that I am in the presence of
greatness. Maybe greatness unfound, or
greatness underdeveloped, but the
potential or existence of greatness
nevertheless. You never know who will
go on to do good or even great things or
become the next great influencer in the
world—so treat everyone
like they are
that person.”
Whatever your age, it’s never too early
or late to begin cultivating a sense of
purpose. I have three recommendations,
each borrowed from one of the purpose
researchers mentioned in this chapter.
David Yeager recommends
reflecting
on how the work you’re already doing
can make a positive contribution to
society
.
In several longitudinal experiments,
David Yeager and his colleague Dave
Paunesku asked high school students,
“How could the world
be a better
place?” and then asked them to draw
connections to what they were learning
in school. In response, one ninth grader
wrote, “I would like to get a job as some
sort of genetic researcher. I would use
this job to help improve the world by
possibly engineering crops to produce
more food. . . .” Another said, “I think
that having an education allows you to
understand the world around you. . . . I
will not be able to help anyone without
first going to school.”
This simple exercise, which took less
than a class period to complete,
dramatically energized student
engagement. Compared to a placebo
control exercise, reflecting on purpose
led students to double the amount of time
they spent studying for an upcoming
exam, work harder on tedious math
problems when given the option to
watch entertaining videos instead, and,
in math and science classes, bring home
better report card grades.
Amy Wrzesniewski recommends
thinking about how, in small but
meaningful ways, you can change your
current work to enhance its connection
to your core values
.
Amy
calls this idea “job crafting,”
and it’s an intervention she’s been
studying with fellow psychologists Jane
Dutton, Justin Berg, and Adam Grant.
This is not a Pollyanna, every-job-can-
be-nirvana idea. It is, simply, the notion
that whatever your occupation, you can
maneuver within your job description—
adding, delegating, and customizing what
you do to match your interests and
values.
Amy and her collaborators recently
tested this idea at Google. Employees
working in positions that don’t
immediately bring the word
purpose
 to
mind—in sales, marketing, finance,
operations, and accounting, for example
—were randomly assigned to a job-
crafting workshop. They came up with
their own ideas for tweaking their daily
routines, each employee making a
personalized “map” for what would
constitute more meaningful and
enjoyable work. Six weeks later,
managers and coworkers rated the
employees who attended this workshop
as significantly happier and more
effective.
Finally, Bill Damon recommends
finding inspiration in a purposeful role
model
. He’d like you to respond in
writing to some of the questions he uses
in his interview research, including,
“Imagine yourself fifteen years from
now. What do you think will be most
important to you then?” and “Can you
think of someone whose life inspires you
to
be a better person? Who? Why?”
When I carried out Bill’s exercise, I
realized that the person in my life who,
more than anyone, has shown me the
beauty of other-centered purpose is my
mom. She is, without exaggeration, the
kindest person I’ve ever met.
Growing up, I didn’t always
appreciate Mom’s generous spirit. I
resented the strangers who shared our
table every Thanksgiving—not just
distant relatives who’d recently
emigrated from China, but their
roommates, and their roommates’
friends. Pretty much anyone who didn’t
have a place to go who happened to run
into my mom in the month of November
was warmly welcomed into our home.
One year, Mom gave away my
birthday presents a month after I’d
unwrapped them, and another, she gave
away my sister’s entire stuffed animal
collection. We threw tantrums and wept
and accused her of not loving us. “But
there are children who need them more,”
she said, genuinely surprised at our
reaction. “You have so much. They have
so little.”
When I told my father I wouldn’t be
taking the MCAT exam for medical
school and, instead, would devote
myself to creating the Summerbridge
program, he was apoplectic. “Why do
you care about poor kids? They’re not
family! You don’t even know them!” I
now realize why. All my life, I’d seen
what one person—my mother—could do
to help many others. I’d witnessed the
power of purpose.

Chapter 9
# Hope
There’s an old Japanese saying:
Fall
seven, rise eight
. If I were ever to get a
tattoo, I’d get these four simple words
indelibly inked.
What is hope?
One kind of hope is the expectation
that tomorrow will be better than today.
It’s the kind of hope that has us yearning
for sunnier weather, or a smoother path
ahead. It comes without the burden of
responsibility. The onus is on the
universe to make things better.
Grit depends on a different kind of
hope. It rests on the expectation that our
own efforts can improve our future.
I
have a feeling tomorrow will be better
is different from
I resolve to make
tomorrow better
. The hope that gritty
people have has nothing to do with luck
and everything to do with
getting up
again.
In the spring semester of my first year of
college, I enrolled in neurobiology.
I would come to each class early and
sit in the front row, where I’d copy
every equation and diagram into my
notebook. Outside of lecture, I did all
the assigned readings and required
problem sets. Going into
the first quiz, I
was a little shaky in a few areas—it was
a tough course, and my high school
biology coursework left a lot to be
desired—but on the whole I felt pretty
confident.
The quiz started out fine but quickly
became more difficult. I began to panic,
thinking over and over:
I’m not going to
finish! I have no idea what I’m doing!
I’m going to fail!
 This, of course, was a
self-fulfilling prophecy. The more my
mind was crowded by those heart-
palpitating thoughts, the less I could
concentrate. Time ran out before I’d
even read the last problem.
A few days later, the professor
handed back the quiz. I looked down
disconsolately at my miserable grade
and, shortly thereafter, shuffled into the
office of my assigned teaching assistant.
“You should really consider dropping
this course,” he advised. “You’re just a
freshman. You have three more years.
You can always take the class later.”
“I took AP Bio in high school,” I
countered.
“How did you do?”
“I got an A, but my teacher didn’t
teach us much, which is probably why I
didn’t take the actual AP exam.” This
confirmed his intuition that I should drop
the course.
Virtually the same scenario repeated
itself with the midterm, for which I’d
studied madly, and after which, I found
myself in the teaching assistant’s office
once again. This time his tone was more
urgent. “You do
not
 want a failing grade
on your transcript. It’s not too late to
withdraw from the course. If you do,
nothing will get factored into your
GPA.”
I thanked him for his time and closed
the door behind me. In the hallway, I
surprised myself by not crying. Instead, I
reviewed the facts of the situation: two
failures and only one more exam—the
final—before the end of the semester. I
realized I should have started out in a
lower-level course, and now, more than
halfway through the semester, it was
obvious my energetic studying wasn’t
proving sufficient. If I stayed, there was
a good chance I’d choke on the final and
end up with an F on my transcript. If I
dropped the course, I’d cut my losses.
I curled my hands into fists, clenched
my jaw, and marched directly to the
registrar’s office. At that moment, I’d
resolved to stay enrolled in—and, in
fact,
major

in—neurobiology.
Looking back on that pivotal day, I
can see that I’d been knocked down—or,
more accurately, tripped on my own two
feet and fell flat on my face. Regardless,
it was a moment when I could have
stayed down. I could have said to
myself:
I’m an idiot! Nothing I do is
good enough!
 And I could have dropped
the class.
Instead, my self-talk was defiantly
hopeful:
I won’t quit! I can figure this
out!
For the rest of the semester, I not only
tried harder, I tried things I hadn’t done
before. I went to every teaching
assistants’ office hours. I asked for extra
work. I practiced doing the most difficult
problems under time pressure—
mimicking the conditions under which I
needed to produce a flawless
performance. I knew my nerves were
going to be a problem at exam time, so I
resolved to attain a level of mastery
where nothing could surprise me. By the
time the final exam came around, I felt
like I could have written it myself.
I aced the final. My overall grade in
the course was a B—the lowest grade
I’d get in four years, but, ultimately, the
one that made me the proudest.
Little did I know when I was foundering
in my neurobiology class that I was re-
creating the conditions of a famous
psychology experiment.
Let me wind back the clock to 1964.
Two first-year psychology doctoral
students named Marty Seligman and
Steve Maier are in a windowless
laboratory, watching a caged dog
receive electric shocks to its back paws.
The shocks come randomly and without
warning. If the dog does nothing, the
shock lasts five seconds, but if the dog
pushes its nose against a panel at the
front of the cage, the shock ends early. In
a separate cage, another dog is receiving
the same shocks at exactly the
same
intervals, but there’s no panel to push on.
In other words, both dogs get the exact
same dosage of shock at the exact same
times, but only the first dog is in control
of how long each shock lasts. After
sixty-four shocks, both dogs go back to
their home cages, and new dogs are
brought in for the same procedure.
The next day, one by one, all the dogs
are placed in a different cage called a
shuttle box. In the middle, there’s a low
wall, just high enough that the dogs can
leap the barrier if they try. A high-
pitched tone plays, heralding an
impending shock, which comes through
the floor of the half of the shuttle box
where the dog is standing. Nearly all the
dogs who had control over the shocks
the previous day learn to leap the
barrier. They hear the tone and jump
over the wall to safety. In contrast, two-
thirds of the dogs who had
no
 control
over the shocks the previous day just lie
down whimpering, passively waiting for
the punishments to stop.
This seminal experiment proved for
the first time that it isn’t suffering that
leads to hopelessness. It’s suffering you
think you can’t control.
Many years after deciding to major in
the subject I was failing, I sat in a
graduate student cubicle a few doors
down from Marty’s office, reading about
this experiment on learned helplessness.
I quickly saw the parallels to my earlier
experience. The first neurobiology quiz
brought unexpected pain. I struggled to
improve my situation, but when the
midterm came, I got shocked again. The
shuttle box was the rest of the semester.
Would I conclude from my earlier
experience that I was helpless to change
my situation? After all, my immediate
experience suggested that two disastrous
outcomes would be followed by a third.
Or would I be like the few dogs who,
despite recent memories of
uncontrollable pain, held fast to hope?
Would I consider my earlier suffering to
be the result of particular mistakes I
could avoid in the future? Would I
expand my focus beyond the recent past,
remembering the many times I’d
shrugged off failure and eventually
prevailed?
As it turns out, I behaved like the
one-third of dogs in Marty and Steve’s
study that persevered. I got up again and
kept fighting.
In the decade following that 1964
experiment, additional experiments
revealed that suffering without control
reliably produces symptoms of clinical
depression, including changes in
appetite and physical activity, sleep
problems, and poor concentration.
When Marty and Steve first proposed
that animals and people can
learn
 that
they are helpless, their theory was
considered downright absurd by fellow
researchers. Nobody at the time took
seriously the possibility that dogs could
have thoughts that then influenced their
behavior. In fact, few psychologists
entertained the possibility that
people
had thoughts that influenced their
behavior. Instead, the received wisdom
was that
all
 living animals simply
respond mechanically to punishments
and rewards.
After a mountain of data had
accumulated, ruling out every
conceivable alternative explanation, the
scientific community was, at long last,
convinced.
Having thoroughly plumbed the
disastrous consequences of
uncontrollable stress in the laboratory,
Marty grew more and more interested in
what could be done about it. He decided
to retrain as a clinical psychologist.
Wisely, he chose to do so under the wing
of Aaron Beck, a psychiatrist and fellow
pioneer in understanding the root causes
and
practical antidotes for depression.
What followed was a vigorous
exploration of the flip side of learned
helplessness, which Marty later dubbed
learned optimism
. The crucial insight
that seeded Marty’s new work was
available from the very beginning:
While two-thirds of the dogs that had
experienced uncontrollable shock later
gave up trying to help themselves, about
a third remained resilient. Despite their
earlier trauma, they kept trying
maneuvers that would bring relief from
pain.
It was those resilient dogs that led
Marty to study the analogous
I won’t quit
response to adversity in people.
Optimists, Marty soon discovered, are
just as likely to encounter bad events as
pessimists. Where they diverge is in
their explanations: optimists habitually
search for temporary and specific causes
of their suffering, whereas pessimists
assume permanent and pervasive causes
are to blame.
Here’s an example from the test
Marty and his students developed to
distinguish optimists from pessimists:
Imagine: You can’t get all the work
done that others expect of you. Now
imagine one major cause for this event.
What leaps to mind?
 After you read that
hypothetical scenario, you write down
your response, and then, after you’re
offered more scenarios, your responses
are rated for how temporary (versus
permanent) and how specific (versus
pervasive) they are.
If you’re a pessimist, you might say,
I
screw up everything.
 Or:
I’m a loser.
These explanations are all permanent;
there’s not much you can do to change
them. They’re also pervasive; they’re
likely to influence lots of life situations,
not just your job performance.
Permanent and pervasive explanations
for adversity turn minor complications
into major catastrophes. They make it
seem logical to give up. If, on the other
hand, you’re an optimist, you might say,
I
mismanaged my time
. Or:
I didn’t work
efficiently because of distractions.
These explanations are all temporary
and specific; their “fixability” motivates
you to start clearing them away as
problems.
Using this test, Marty confirmed that,
compared to optimists, pessimists are
more likely to
suffer from depression
and anxiety. What’s more, optimists fare
better in domains not directly related to
mental health. For instance, optimistic
undergraduates tend to earn higher
grades and are less likely to
drop out of
school. Optimistic young adults
stay
healthier throughout middle age and,
ultimately, live longer than pessimists.
Optimists are more
satisfied with their
marriages. A one-year field study of
MetLife insurance agents found that
optimists are twice as likely to stay in
their jobs, and that they
sell about 25
percent more insurance
than their
pessimistic colleagues. Likewise,
studies of salespeople in
telecommunications, real estate, office
products, car sales, banking, and other
industries have shown that optimists
outsell pessimists by 20 to 40 percent.
In one study, elite swimmers, many of
whom were training for the U.S.
Olympic trials, took Marty’s optimism
test. Next, coaches asked each swimmer
to
swim in his or her best event and then
deliberately told each swimmer they’d
swum just a little
slower
 than was
actually the case. Given the opportunity
to repeat their event, optimists did at
least as well as in their first attempt, but
pessimists performed substantially
worse.
How do grit paragons think about
setbacks? Overwhelmingly, I’ve found
that they explain events optimistically.
Journalist Hester Lacey finds the same
striking pattern in her interviews with
remarkably creative people. “What has
been your greatest disappointment?” she
asks each of them. Whether they’re
artists or entrepreneurs or community
activists, their response is nearly
identical. “Well, I don’t really think in
terms of disappointment. I tend to think
that everything that happens is something
I can learn from. I tend to think, ‘Well
okay, that didn’t go so well, but I guess
I
will just carry on.’ ”
Around the time Marty Seligman took his
two-year hiatus from laboratory
research, his new mentor Aaron Beck
was questioning his own training in
Freudian psychoanalysis. Like most
psychiatrists at the time, Beck had been
taught that all forms of mental illness
were rooted in unconscious childhood
conflicts.
Beck disagreed. He had the audacity
to suggest that a psychiatrist could
actually talk directly to patients about
what was bothering them, and that the
patients’ thoughts—their self-talk—
could be the target of therapy. The
foundational insight of Beck’s new
approach was that the
same objective
event
—losing a job, getting into an
argument with
a coworker, forgetting to
call a friend—can lead to
very different
subjective interpretations
. And it is
those interpretations—rather than the
objective events themselves—that can
give rise to our feelings and our
behavior.
Cognitive behavioral therapy—which
aims to treat depression and other
psychological maladies by helping
patients think more objectively and
behave in healthier ways—has shown
that, whatever our childhood sufferings,
we can generally learn to observe our
negative self-talk and change our
maladaptive behaviors. As with any
other skill, we can practice interpreting
what happens to us and responding as an
optimist would. Cognitive behavioral
therapy is now a widely practiced
psychotherapeutic treatment for
depression, and has proven
longer-
lasting in its effects than antidepressant
medication.
A few years after I’d gotten a toehold in
grit research, Wendy Kopp, the founder
and then CEO of Teach For America,
came to visit Marty.
Then still his graduate student, I was
eager to join their meeting for two
reasons. First, Teach For America was
sending hundreds of recent college
graduates into disadvantaged school
districts across the country. From
personal experience, I knew teaching to
be a grit-demanding profession, nowhere
more so than in the urban and rural
classrooms where TFA teachers are
assigned. Second, Wendy was herself a
paragon of grit. Famously, she’d
conceived of TFA during her senior year
at Princeton and, unlike so many
idealists who eventually give up on their
dream, she’d stuck with it, starting from
nothing and creating one of the largest
and most influential educational
nonprofits in the country. “
Relentless
pursuit” was both a core value of TFA
and the phrase often used by friends and
coworkers to describe Wendy’s
leadership style.
At that meeting, the three of us
developed a hypothesis: Teachers who
have an optimistic way of interpreting
adversity have more grit than their more
pessimistic counterparts, and grit, in
turn, predicts
better teaching. For
instance, an optimistic teacher might
keep looking for ways to help an
uncooperative student, whereas a
pessimist might assume there was
nothing more to be done. To test whether
that was true, we decided to measure
optimism and grit before teachers set
foot in the classroom and, a year later,
see how effectively teachers had
advanced the academic progress of their
students.
That August, four hundred TFA
teachers completed the Grit Scale and,
in addition, Marty’s questionnaire
assessing their optimism. To the extent
they thought of temporary and specific
causes for bad events, and permanent
and pervasive causes of good events, we
coded their responses as optimistic. To
the extent they did the reverse, we coded
their responses as pessimistic.
In the same survey, we measured one
more thing: happiness. Why? For one
thing, there was a small but growing
body of scientific evidence that
happiness wasn’t just the
consequence
of performing well at work, it might also
be an important
cause
. Also, we were
curious about how happy the grittiest
teachers were. Did single-minded
passion and perseverance come at a
cost? Or could you be gritty and happy at
the same time?
One year later, when Teach For
America had tabulated effectiveness
ratings for each teacher based on the
academic gains of their students, we
analyzed our data. Just as we’d
expected,
optimistic teachers were
grittier and happier, and grit and
happiness in turn explained why
optimistic teachers got their students to
achieve more during the school year.
After staring at these results for a
while, I began reminiscing about my
own experience of classroom teaching. I
remembered the many afternoons I’d
gone home exasperated and exhausted. I
remembered battling catastrophic self-
talk about my own capabilities—
Oh
god, I really am an idiot!
—and those of
my young charges—
She got it wrong
again? She’ll never learn this!
 And I
remembered the mornings I’d gotten up
and decided, after all, that there was one
more tactic worth trying:
Maybe if I
bring in a Hershey bar and cut it into
pieces, they’ll get the idea of fractions.
Maybe if I have everyone clean out
their lockers on Mondays, they’ll get in
the habit of keeping their lockers clean.
The data from this study of young
teachers, along with Wendy Kopp’s
intuitions, interviews with grit paragons,
and a half century of psychological
research all point to the same,
commonsense conclusion: When you
keep searching for ways to change your
situation for the better, you stand a
chance of finding them. When you stop
searching, assuming they can’t be found,
you guarantee they won’t.
Or as Henry Ford is often quoted as
saying, “Whether you think you can, or
think you can’t—you’re right.”
Around the time Marty Seligman and
Steve Maier were linking hopelessness
to a lack of perceived control, a young
psychology major named Carol Dweck
was making her way through college.
Carol had always been intrigued that
some people persevere while others in
identical circumstances give up. Right
after graduation, she enrolled in a
doctoral program in psychology and
pursued this question.
Marty and Steve’s work had a
profound influence on young Carol. She
believed their findings but was
unsatisfied. Sure, attributing your misery
to causes beyond your control was
debilitating, but where did these
attributions come from in the first place?
Why, she asked, did one person grow up
to be an optimist and another a
pessimist?
In
one of Carol’s first studies, she
worked with middle schools to identify
boys and girls who, by consensus of
their teachers, the school principal, and
the school psychologist, were especially
“helpless” when confronted by failure.
Her hunch was that these children
believed that a lack of intellectual
ability led to mistakes, rather than a lack
of effort. In other words, she suspected it
wasn’t
just
 a long string of failures that
made these children pessimistic, but
rather their core beliefs about success
and learning.
To test her idea, Carol divided the
children into two groups. Half the
children were assigned to a
success only
program. For several weeks, they solved
math problems and, at the end of each
session, no matter how many they’d
completed, they received praise for
doing well. The other half of the
children in Carol’s study were assigned
to an
attribution retraining
 program.
These children also solved math
problems, but were occasionally told
that they hadn’t solved enough problems
during that particular session and,
crucially, that they “should have tried
harder.”
Afterward, all the children were
given a combination of easy and very
difficult problems to do.
Carol reasoned that, if prior failures
were the root cause of helplessness, the
success only
 program would boost
motivation. If, on the other hand, the real
problem was how children interpreted
their failures, then the
attribution
retraining
 program would be more
effective.
What Carol found is that the children
in the
success only
 program gave up just
as easily after encountering very difficult
problems as they had before training. In
sharp contrast, children in the
attribution retraining
 program tried
harder after encountering difficulty. It
seems as though they’d learned to
interpret failure as a cue to try harder
rather than as confirmation that they
lacked the ability to succeed.
Over the next four decades, Carol
probed deeper.
She soon discovered that people of
all ages carry around in their minds
private theories about how the world
works. These points of view are
conscious in that if Carol asks you
questions about them, you have a ready
answer. But like the thoughts you work
on when you go to a cognitive
behavioral therapist, you may not be
aware of them until you’re asked.
Here are four statements Carol uses
to
assess a person’s theory
of
intelligence. Read them now and
consider how much you agree or
disagree with each:
Your intelligence is something very basic
about you that you can’t change very
much.
You can learn new things, but you can’t
really change how intelligent you are.
No matter how much intelligence you
have, you can always change it quite a
bit.
You can always substantially change
how intelligent you are.
If you found yourself nodding
affirmatively to the first two statements
but shaking your head in disagreement
with the last two, then Carol would say
you have more of a fixed mindset. If you
had the opposite reaction, then Carol
would say you tend toward a growth
mindset.
I like to think of a growth mindset this
way: Some of us believe, deep down,
that people really
can
 change. These
growth-oriented people assume that it’s
possible, for example, to get smarter
if
you’re given the right opportunities and
support and
if
 you try hard enough and
if
you believe you can do it. Conversely,
some people think you can learn skills,
like how to ride a bike or do a sales
pitch, but your
capacity
 to learn skills—
your talent—can’t be trained. The
problem with holding the latter fixed-
mindset view—and many people who
consider themselves talented
do
—is that
no road is without bumps. Eventually,
you’re going to hit one. At that point,
having a fixed mind-set becomes a
tremendous liability. This is when a C–,
a rejection letter, a disappointing
progress review at work, or any other
setback can derail you. With a fixed
mindset, you’re likely to interpret these
setbacks as evidence that, after all, you
don’t have “the right stuff”—you’re not
good enough. With a growth mindset,
you believe you can learn to do better.
Mindsets have been shown to make a
difference in all the same life domains
as optimism. For instance, if you have a
growth mindset, you’re more likely to do
well in school, enjoy better emotional
and physical health, and have stronger,
more
positive social relationships with
other people.
A few years ago, Carol and I asked
more than two thousand high school
seniors to complete a growth-mindset
questionnaire. We’ve found that students
with a growth mindset are significantly
grittier than students with a fixed
mindset. What’s more, grittier students
earn higher report card grades and, after
graduation, are more likely to enroll in
and
persist through college. I’ve since
measured growth mindset and grit in
both younger children and older adults,
and in every sample, I’ve found that
growth mindset and grit go together.
When you ask Carol where our mindsets
come from, she’ll point to people’s
personal histories of success and failure
and how the people around them,
particularly those in a position of
authority, have responded to these
outcomes.
Consider, for example, what people
said to you when, as a child, you did
something really well. Were you praised
for your talent? Or were you praised for
your effort? Either way, chances are you
use the same language today when
evaluating victories and defeats.
Praising effort and learning over
“natural talent” is an explicit target of
teacher training in the
KIPP schools.
KIPP stands for the Knowledge Is Power
Program, and it was started in 1994 by
Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin, two
gritty young Teach For America
teachers. Today, KIPP schools serve
seventy thousand elementary, middle,
and high school students across the
country. The vast majority of KIPPsters,
as they proudly refer to themselves,
come from low-income families. Against
the odds, almost all graduate from high
school, and more than 80 percent go on
to college.
KIPP teachers get a little thesaurus
during training. On one side, there are
encouragements teachers often use with
the best of intentions. On the other, there
is language that subtly sends the message
that life is about challenging yourself
and learning to do what you couldn’t do
before. See below for examples
appropriate for people of any age.
Whether you’re a parent, manager,
coach, or any other type of mentor, I
suggest you observe your own language
over the next few days, listening for the
beliefs your words may be reinforcing in
yourself and others.

Language is one way to cultivate hope.
But modeling a growth mindset—
demonstrating by our
actions
 that we
truly believe people can learn to learn—
may be even more important.
Author and activist James Baldwin
once put it this way: “Children have
never been very good at listening to their
elders, but they have
never failed to
imitate them.” This is one of Dave
Levin’s favorite quotes, and I’ve
watched him begin many KIPP training
workshops with it.
A psychologist in my lab, Daeun
Park, recently found this to be exactly
the case. In a yearlong study of first- and
second-grade classrooms, she found that
teachers who gave special privileges to
higher-performing students and
emphasized how they compared to
others
inadvertently inculcated a fixed
mindset among the young students. Over
the year, students of teachers who acted
this way grew to prefer games and
problems that were easy, “so you can get
a lot right.” By year’s end, they were
more likely to agree that “a person is a
certain amount smart, and stays pretty
much the same.”
Similarly, Carol and her
collaborators are finding that children
develop more of a fixed mindset when
their
parents react to mistakes as though
they’re harmful and problematic. This is
true even when these parents
say
 they
have a growth mindset. Our children are
watching us, and they’re imitating what
we do.
The same dynamics
apply in a
corporate setting. Berkeley professor
Jennifer Chatman and her collaborators
recently surveyed employees of Fortune
1000 companies about mindset,
motivation, and well-being. They found
that, in each company, there was a
consensus about mindset. In fixed-
mindset companies, employees agreed
with statements like “When it comes to
being successful, this company seems to
believe that people have a certain
amount of talent, and they really can’t do
much to change it.” They felt that only a
few star performers were highly valued
and that the company wasn’t truly
invested in other employees’
development. These respondents also
admitted to keeping secrets, cutting
corners, and cheating to get ahead. By
contrast, in growth-mindset cultures,
employees were 47 percent more likely
to say their colleagues were trustworthy,
49 percent more likely to say
their
company fosters innovation, and 65
percent more likely to say their company
supports risk taking.
How do
you
 treat high achievers?
How do you react when others
disappoint you?
My guess is that no matter how much
you embrace the idea of growth mindset,
you often default to a fixed mindset. At
least, this is the case for Carol, Marty,
and me. All of us know how we’d
like
 to
react when, say, someone we’re
supervising brings us work that falls
short of expectations. We’d like our
knee-jerk reflex to be calm and
encouraging. We aspire to have an
Okay,
what is there to learn here?
 attitude
toward mistakes.
But we’re human. So, more often than
we’d like, we get frustrated. We show
our impatience. In judging the person’s
abilities, we allow a flicker of doubt to
distract us momentarily from the more
important task of what they could do next
to improve.
The reality is that most people have
an inner fixed-mindset pessimist in them
right alongside their inner growth-
mindset optimist. Recognizing this is
important because it’s easy to make the
mistake of changing what we say
without
 changing our body language,
facial expressions, and behavior.
So what should we do? A good first
step is to watch for mismatches between
our words and actions. When we slip up
—and we
will
—we can simply
acknowledge that it’s hard to move away
from a fixed, pessimistic view of the
world. One of Carol’s colleagues, Susan
Mackie, works with CEOs and
encourages them to give names to their
inner fixed-mindset characters. Then
they can say things like “Oops. I guess I
brought Controlling Claire to the meeting
today. Let me try that again.” Or:
“Overwhelmed Olivia is struggling to
deal with all the competing demands,
can you help me think this through?”
Ultimately, adopting a gritty
perspective involves recognizing that
people get better at things—they
grow.
Just as we want to cultivate the ability to
get up off the floor when life has
knocked us down, we
want to give those
around us the benefit of the doubt when
something they’ve tried isn’t a raging
success. There’s always tomorrow.
I recently called Bill McNabb for his
perspective. Since 2008, Bill has served
as the CEO of Vanguard, the world’s
largest provider of mutual funds.
“We’ve actually
tracked senior
leaders here at Vanguard and asked why
some did better in the long run than
others. I used to use the word
‘complacency’ to describe the ones who
didn’t work out, but the more I reflect on
it, the more I realize that’s not quite it.
It’s really a belief that ‘I can’t learn
anymore. I am what I am. This is how I
do things.’ ”
And what about executives who
ultimately excelled?
“The people who have continued to
be successful here have stayed on a
growth trajectory. They just keep
surprising you with how much they’re
growing. We’ve had people who, if you
looked at their résumé coming in, you’d
say, ‘Wow, how did that person end up
so successful?’ And we’ve had other
people come in with incredible
credentials, and you’re wondering, ‘Why
did they not go further?’ ”
When Bill discovered the research on
growth mindset and grit, it confirmed his
intuitions—not just as a corporate leader
but as a father, former high school Latin
teacher, rowing coach, and athlete. “I
really do think people develop theories
about themselves and the world, and it
determines what they do.”
When we got to the question of
where, exactly, any of us begin
formulating these theories, Bill said,
“Believe it or not, I actually started out
with more of a fixed mindset.” He chalks
up that mindset, partly, to his parents
enrolling him, while he was still in
elementary school, in a research study at
a nearby university. He remembers
taking a whole battery of intelligence
tests and, at the end, being told, “You did
really well, and you’re going to do
really well in school.”
For a while, an authoritative
diagnosis of talent, in combination
with
early success, boosted his confidence: “I
took great pride in finishing tests faster
than anyone else. I didn’t always get one
hundred percent, but I usually came
close, and I took great pleasure in not
working that hard to achieve what I did.”
Bill attributes his switch to a growth
mindset to joining the crew team in
college. “I’d never rowed before, but I
found I liked being on the water. I liked
being outside. I liked the exercise. I sort
of fell in love with the sport.”
Rowing was the first thing Bill
wanted to do well that didn’t come
easily: “I was not a natural,” he told me.
“I had a lot of failures early on. But I
kept going, and then eventually, I started
getting better. Suddenly, it began to make
sense: ‘Put your head down and go hard.
Hard work really, really matters.’ ” By
the end of his freshman season, Bill was
in the junior varsity boat. That didn’t
sound so bad to me, but Bill explained
that, statistically, this placement
suggested there was no chance of ever
making varsity. That summer, he stayed
on campus and rowed all summer.
All that practice paid off. Bill was
promoted to the “stroke seat” of the
junior varsity boat, making him the one
who sets the pace for the other seven
rowers. During the season, one of the
varsity rowers was injured, and Bill had
the opportunity to show what he could
do. By his account, and also the team
captain’s, he did terrifically well. Still,
when the injured rower recovered, the
coach demoted Bill again.
“That coach had a fixed mindset—he
just couldn’t believe that I’d improved
as much as I did.”
There were more ups and downs, but
Bill’s growth mindset kept getting
affirmed. “Because I’d come so damn
close to quitting and yet hung in there,
and because things eventually did work
out, I learned a lesson I’d never forget.
The lesson was that, when you have
setbacks and failures, you can’t
overreact to them. You need to step
back, analyze them, and learn from them.
But you also need to stay optimistic.”
How did that lesson help Bill later in
life? “There have been times
in my
career where I felt discouraged. I’d
watch someone else get promoted before
me. I’d want things to go a certain way,
and they’d go the opposite. At those
points, I’d say to myself, ‘Just keep
working hard and learning, and it will
all work out.’ ”
“What doesn’t kill me
makes me
stronger,” Nietzsche once said. Kanye
West and Kelly Clarkson echo the same
sentiment, and there’s a reason we keep
repeating it. Many of us can remember a
time when, like Bill McNabb, we were
confronted with challenge and yet
emerged on the other side
more
confident than when we began.
Consider, for example, the Outward
Bound program, which sends
adolescents or adults into the wilderness
with experienced leaders, usually for a
few weeks. From its inception a half
century ago, the premise of Outward
Bound—so named for the moment a ship
leaves harbor for the open seas—has
been that challenging outdoor situations
develop “
tenacity in pursuit” and
“undefeatable spirit.” In fact, across
dozens of studies, the program has been
shown to increase independence,
confidence, assertiveness, and the belief
that what happens in life is largely under
your control. What’s more, these
benefits
tend to increase, rather than diminish, in
the six months following participation in
the program.
All the same, it’s undeniable that
what doesn’t kill us sometimes makes us
weaker
. Consider the dogs who were
shocked repeatedly with no control. A
third of the dogs were resilient to this
adversity, but there was no evidence that
any of the dogs in the uncontrollable
stress condition benefited from the
experience in any way. On the contrary,
most
were much more vulnerable to
suffering in the immediate aftermath.
So, it appears that sometimes what
doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and
sometimes it does the opposite. The
urgent question becomes: When? When
does struggle lead to hope, and when
does struggle lead to hopelessness?
A few years ago,
Steve Maier and his
students designed an experiment nearly
identical to the one he and Marty
Seligman had conducted forty years
earlier: One group of rats received
electric shocks, but if they turned a small
wheel with their front paws, they could
turn off the shock until the next trial. A
second group received the exact same
dose of electric shocks as the first but
had no control over their duration.
One crucial difference was that, in
the new experiment, the rats were only
five weeks old—that’s adolescence in
the rat life cycle. A second difference
was that the effects of this experience
were assessed five weeks later, when
the rats were fully mature adults. At that
point, both groups of rats were subjected
to uncontrollable electric shocks and, the
next day, observed in a social
exploration test.
Here’s what Steve learned.
Adolescent rats who experienced stress
they could
not
 control grew up to be
adult rats who, after being subjected to
uncontrollable shocks a second time,
behaved timidly. This was not unusual—
they learned to be helpless in the same
way that any other rat would. In contrast,
adolescent rats who experienced stress
they
could
 control grew up to be more
adventurous and, most astounding,
appeared to be inoculated against
learned helplessness in adulthood.
That’s right—when these “resilient rats”
grew up, the usual uncontrollable shock
procedures no longer made them
helpless.
In other words, what didn’t kill the
young rats, when by their own efforts
they could
control
 what was happening,
made them stronger for life.
When I learned about Steve Maier’s new
experimental work, I just had to talk to
him in person. I got on a plane to
Colorado.
Steve walked me around his
laboratory and showed me the special
cages equipped with little wheels that,
when turned, cut off the current to the
electric shock. Afterward, the graduate
student who ran the experiment on
adolescent rats that I just described gave
a talk on
the brain circuits and
neurotransmitters involved. Finally,
when Steve and I sat down together, I
asked him to explain, from this
experiment and everything else he’d
done in his long and distinguished
career, the neurobiology of hope.
Steve thought for a moment. “Here’s
the deal in a few sentences. You’ve got
lots of places in the brain that respond to
aversive experiences. Like the
amygdala. In fact, there are a whole
bunch of limbic areas that
respond to
stress.”
I nodded.
“Now what happens is that these
limbic structures are regulated by
higher-order brain areas, like the
prefrontal cortex. And so, if you have an
appraisal, a thought, a belief—whatever
you want to call it—that says, ‘Wait a
minute, I can do something about this!’ or
‘This really isn’t so bad!’ or whatever,
then these inhibitory structures in the
cortex are activated. They send a
message: ‘Cool it down there! Don’t get
so activated. There’s something we can
do.’ ”
I got it. But I still didn’t understand,
fully, why Steve had gone to the trouble
of experimenting with adolescent rats.
“The long-term story needs some
more explanation,” he continued. “We
think there is plasticity in that circuitry.
If you experience adversity—something
pretty potent—that you overcome on
your own during your youth, you develop
a different way of dealing with adversity
later on. It’s important that the adversity
be pretty potent. Because these brain
areas really have to wire together in
some fashion, and that doesn’t happen
with just minor inconveniences.”
So you can’t
just
 talk someone into
believing they can master challenges?
“That’s right. Just telling somebody
they can overcome adversity isn’t
enough. For the rewiring to happen, you
have to activate the control circuitry at
the same time as those low-level areas.
That happens when you experience
mastery at the same time as adversity.”
And what about a life history of
challenge
without
 control?
“I worry a lot about kids in poverty,”
Steve said. “They’re getting a lot of
helplessness experiences. They’re not
getting enough mastery experiences.
They’re not learning: ‘I can do this. I can
succeed in that.’ My speculation is that
those earlier experiences can have really
enduring effects. You need to learn that
there’s a contingency between your
actions and what happens to you: ‘If I do
something, then something will
happen.’ ”
The scientific research is very clear that
experiencing trauma without control can
be debilitating. But I also worry about
people who cruise through life, friction-
free, for a long, long time before
encountering their first real failure. They
have so little practice falling and getting
up again. They have so many reasons to
stick with a fixed mindset.
I see a lot of invisibly vulnerable
high-achievers stumble in young
adulthood and struggle to get up again. I
call them the “fragile perfects.”
Sometimes I meet fragile perfects in my
office after a midterm or a final. Very
quickly, it becomes clear that these
bright and wonderful people know how
to succeed but not how to fail.
Last year, I kept in touch with a
freshman at Penn named Kayvon
Asemani. Kayvon has the sort of résumé
that might make you worry he’s a fragile
perfect: valedictorian of his high school
class, student body president, star
athlete . . . the list goes on.
But I assure you that Kayvon is the
very embodiment of growth mindset and
optimism. We met when he was a senior
at the
Milton Hershey School, a tuition-
free boarding school originally
established by chocolatier Milton
Hershey for orphan boys and, to this day,
a haven for children from severely
disadvantaged backgrounds. Kayvon and
his siblings ended up at Hershey just
before Kayvon entered the fifth grade—
one year after his father nearly strangled
his mother to death, leaving her in a
permanent coma.
At Hershey, Kayvon thrived. He
discovered a passion for music,
playing
the trombone in two school bands. And
he discovered leadership, giving
speeches to state politicians, creating a
student-run school news website,
chairing committees that raised tens of
thousands of dollars for charity, and in
his senior year, serving as student body
president.
In January, Kayvon emailed to let me
know how his first semester had gone. “I
finished the first semester with a 3.5,” he
wrote. “Three A’s and one C. I’m not
completely satisfied with it. I know what
I did right to get the A’s and I know what
I did wrong to get the C.”
As for his poorest grade? “That C in
Economics caught up to me because I
was in a hole from my conflicted
thoughts about this place and whether I
fit in. . . . I can definitely do better than a
3.5, and a 4.0 is not out of the question.
My first semester mentality was that I
have a lot to learn from these kids. My
new mentality is that I have a lot to teach
them.”
The spring semester wasn’t exactly
smooth sailing, either. Kayvon earned a
bunch of A’s but didn’t do nearly as well
as he’d hoped in his two quantitative
courses. We talked, briefly, about the
option of transferring out of Wharton,
Penn’s highly competitive business
school, and I pointed out that there was
no shame in switching into a different
major. Kayvon was having none of it.
Here’s an excerpt from his email to
me in June: “Numbers and executing
quantitative concepts have always been
difficult for me. But I embrace the
challenge, and I’m going to apply all the
grit I have to improving myself and
making myself better, even if it means
graduating with a GPA less than what I
would have earned if I just majored in
something that didn’t require me to
manipulate numbers.”
I have no doubt that Kayvon will
keep getting up, time and again,
always
learning and growing.
Collectively, the evidence I’ve
presented tells the following story: A
fixed mindset about ability leads to
pessimistic explanations of
adversity,
and that, in turn, leads to both giving up
on challenges and avoiding them in the
first place. In contrast, a growth mindset
leads to optimistic ways of explaining
adversity, and that, in turn, leads to
perseverance and seeking out new
challenges that will ultimately make you
even stronger.
My recommendation for teaching
yourself hope is to take each step in the
sequence above and ask,
What can I do
to boost this one?
My first suggestion in that regard is to
update your beliefs about intelligence
and talent
.
When Carol and her collaborators try
to convince people that intelligence, or
any other talent, can improve with effort,
she starts by explaining the brain. For
instance, she recounts a study published
in the top scientific journal
Nature
 that
tracked adolescent brain development.
Many of the adolescents in this study
increased their IQ scores from age
fourteen, when the study started, to age
eighteen, when it concluded. This fact—
that IQ scores are not entirely fixed over
a person’s life span—usually comes as a
surprise. What’s more, Carol continues,
these same adolescents showed sizable
changes in brain structure: “Those who
got better at math skills strengthened the
areas of the brain related to math, and
the same was true for English skills.”
Carol also explains that the brain is
remarkably adaptive. Like a muscle that
gets stronger with use, the brain changes
itself when you struggle to master a new
challenge. In fact, there’s never a time in
life when the brain is completely
“fixed.” Instead, all our lives, our
neurons retain the potential to grow new
connections with one another and to
strengthen the ones we already have.
What’s more, throughout adulthood, we
maintain the
ability to grow myelin, a
sort of insulating sheath that protects
neurons and speeds signals traveling
between them.
My next suggestion is to
practice
optimistic self-talk
.
The link between cognitive
behavioral therapy and learned
helplessness led to the development of
“
resilience training.” In essence, this
interactive curriculum is a preventative
dose of
cognitive behavioral therapy. In
one study, children who completed this
training showed lower levels of
pessimism and developed fewer
symptoms of depression over the next
two years. In a similar study, pessimistic
college students demonstrated less
anxiety over the subsequent two years
and less depression over three years.
If, reading this chapter, you recognize
yourself as an extreme pessimist, my
advice is to find a cognitive behavioral
therapist. I know how unsatisfying this
recommendation might sound. Many
years ago, as a teenager, I wrote to Dear
Abby about a problem I was having.
“Go see a therapist,” she wrote back. I
recall tearing up her letter, angry she
didn’t propose a neater, faster, more
straightforward solution. Nevertheless,
suggesting that reading twenty pages
about the science of hope is enough to
remove an ingrained pessimistic bias
would be naive. There’s much more to
say about cognitive behavioral therapy
and resilience training than I can
summarize here.
The point is that you can, in fact,
modify your self-talk, and you can learn
to not let it interfere with you moving
toward your goals. With practice and
guidance, you can change the way you
think, feel, and, most important, act when
the going gets rough.
As a transition to the final section of
this book, “Growing Grit from the
Outside In,” let me offer one final
suggestion for teaching yourself hope:
Ask for a helping hand
.
A few years ago, I met a retired
mathematician named Rhonda Hughes.
Nobody in Rhonda’s family had gone to
college, but as a girl,
she liked math a
whole lot more than stenography.
Rhonda eventually earned a PhD in
mathematics and, after seventy-nine of
her eighty applications for a faculty
position were rejected, she took a job at
the single university that made her an
offer.
One reason Rhonda got in touch was
to tell me that she had an issue with an
item on the Grit Scale. “I don’t like that
item that says, ‘Setbacks don’t
discourage me.’ That makes no sense. I
mean, who doesn’t get discouraged by
setbacks? I certainly do. I think it should
say, ‘Setbacks don’t discourage me
for
long.
I get back on my feet
.’ ”
Of course, Rhonda was right, and in
so many words, I changed the item
accordingly.
But the most important thing about
Rhonda’s story is that she almost never
got back up all by herself. Instead, she
figured out that asking for help was a
good way to hold on to hope.
Here’s just one of the stories she told
me: “I had this mentor who knew, even
before I did, that I was going to be a
mathematician. It all started when I’d
done very poorly on one of his tests, and
I went to his office and cried. All of a
sudden, he jumped up out of his chair
and, without a word, ran out of the room.
When, finally, he came back he said,
‘Young lady, you should go to graduate
school in mathematics. But you’re taking
all of the wrong courses.’ And he had all
of the courses I
should
 have been taking
mapped out, and the personal promises
of other faculty that they’d help.”
About twenty years ago, Rhonda
cofounded the EDGE Program with
Sylvia Bozeman, a fellow
mathematician. EDGE stands for
Enhancing Diversity in Graduate
Education, and its mission is to support
women and minority students pursuing
doctoral training in mathematics.
“People assume you have to have some
special talent to do mathematics,” Sylvia
has said. “They think you’re either born
with it, or you’re not. But Rhonda and I
keep saying, ‘You actually
develop
 the
ability to do mathematics.
Don’t give
up
!’ ”
“There have been so many times in
my career when I wanted to pack it in,
when I wanted to give up and do
something easier,” Rhonda told me. “But
there was always someone who, in one
way or another, told me to keep going. I
think everyone needs somebody like that.
Don’t you?”
I
. There’s an expression in sports: “Race your
strengths and train your weaknesses.” I agree
with the wisdom of this adage, but I also think
it’s important that people recognize that skills
improve with practice.

# Outside In

Chapter 10
# Parenting For
# Grit
What can I do to encourage grit in the
people I care for?
I’m asked this question at least once a
day.
Sometimes it’s a coach who asks;
sometimes it’s an entrepreneur or a
CEO. Last week, it was a fourth-grade
teacher, and the week before, a math
professor at a community college. I’ve
had army generals and navy admirals
toss me this question, too, but most often
it’s a mother or father who worries that
their child isn’t close to realizing their
potential.
All the people quizzing me are
thinking as parents would, of course—
even if they’re
not
 parents. The word
parenting
 derives from Latin and means
“to bring forth.” You’re acting in a
parentlike way if you’re asking for
guidance on how to best bring forth
interest, practice, purpose, and hope in
the people you care for.
When I turn the tables and ask people for
their own intuitions on how to “parent
for grit,” I get different answers.
Some believe grit is forged in the
crucible of adversity. Others are quick to
paraphrase Nietzsche: “What doesn’t
kill you makes you
stronger.”
I
 Such
invocations conjure an image of
scowling mothers and fathers dispensing
endless criticism on the sidelines of
games that had better be victories, or
chaining their children to the piano
bench or violin stand, or grounding them
for the sin of an A–.
This perspective assumes that
offering loving support and demanding
high standards are two ends of a
continuum, with the authoritarian parents
of the gritty far to the right of center.
Had I been around to seek opinions a
century ago, such would have been the
perspective of John Watson, then chair
of psychology at Johns Hopkins
University.
In his best-selling 1928 parenting
guide,
Psychological Care of Infant and
Child
, Watson holds forth on how to
raise a child “who loses himself in work
and play, who quickly learns to
overcome the small difficulties in his
environment . . . and who finally enters
manhood so bulwarked with stable work
and emotional habits that no adversity
can quite overwhelm him.”
Here’s Watson’s advice: “Never hug
and kiss them. Never let them sit in your
lap. If you must, kiss them once on the
forehead when they say good night.
Shake hands with them in the morning.
Give them a pat on the head if they have
made an extraordinarily good job of a
difficult task.” Watson further
recommends letting children cope with
problems on their own “almost from the
moment of birth,” rotating different
caregivers to prevent unhealthy
attachment to any one adult, and
otherwise avoiding the coddling
affection that prevents a child from
“conquering the world.”
Occasionally, of course, people take
the opposite stance.
They’re convinced that perseverance
and especially passion bloom when
children are lavished with unconditional
affection and
support. These champions
of kinder and gentler parenting advocate
big hugs and long leashes and point out
that children are by their nature
challenge-seeking creatures whose
innate desire for competence needs only
our unconditional love and affection to
reveal itself. Once unfettered by the
demands of imperious parents, children
will follow their own intrinsic interests,
and disciplined practice and resilience
in the face of setbacks will follow.
On the continuum between supportive
and demanding parenting, proponents of
this permissive “child-centered”
approach fall to the left of center.
So which is it? Is grit forged in the
crucible of unrelentingly high standards
or is it nurtured in the warm embrace of
loving support?
As a scientist, I’m tempted to answer
that we need more research on the topic.
There’s a lot of research on parenting,
and some research on grit, but no
research yet on parenting
and
 grit.
But as a mother of two teenagers, I
don’t have time for all the data to come
in. Like the parents asking
me
 this
question, I have to make decisions today.
My girls are growing up, and each day
of their lives, my husband and I are
parenting them, for better or for worse.
What’s more, as a professor and a lab
director, I interact with dozens of young
people—and I’d like to encourage their
grit, too.
So, as a step toward resolving the
debate, I’ve probed the evidence for
each side. An advocate of old-fashioned,
strict parenting suggested I talk to grit
paragon Steve Young, the record-
breaking quarterback whose Mormon
upbringing included a daily paper route,
Bible classes before school, and
absolutely no cussing or drinking.
Meanwhile, an advocate with a more
liberal bent pointed me toward
Francesca Martinez, the outspoken
British stand-up comic whose writer
father and environmentalist mother
allowed her to drop out of school when
she was sixteen and didn’t bat an eye
when she titled her memoir
What the
**** Is Normal?!
Let’s begin with Steve Young.
The legendary quarterback of the San
Francisco 49ers was twice named Most
Valuable Player in the National Football
League. And he was selected Most
Valuable Player of Super Bowl XXIX,
during which he completed a record-
breaking six touchdown passes. At
retirement, he was the highest-rated
quarterback in NFL history.
“
My parents were my foundation,”
Steve has said. “Good parenting is
something I wish everyone could have.”
Here’s a story to illustrate his point.
Though Steve had been the star of his
high school football team and was
heavily recruited by colleges across the
country, he entered Brigham Young
University as their eighth-string
quarterback. Since seven other
quarterbacks stood between Steve and
playing time, his coach relegated him to
the “hamburger squad”—a unit
composed of the least valuable players
whose primary role was to run plays so
the BYU defensive line could practice.
“Man, I wanted to go home,” Steve
recalled. “I went to school my whole
first semester with my bags packed. . . . I
remember calling [my dad] and just
saying, ‘Coaches don’t know my name.
I’m just a big tackling dummy for the
defense. Dad, it’s horrible. And this is
just not what I expected . . . and I think
I’d like to come home.’ ”
Steve’s father, whom Steve describes
as “the ultimate tough guy,” told him:
“You can quit. . . . But you can’t come
home because I’m not going to live with
a quitter. You’ve known that since you
were a kid.
You’re not coming back
here.” Steve stayed.
All season, Steve was first to
practice and last to leave. After the
team’s last game, he stepped up his
private workouts: “There was a huge net
hanging at the far end of the field house.
I squatted behind an imaginary center;
took the snap; did the three-step drop,
and threw into the net. From the
beginning of January to the end of
February,

I threw over 10,000 spirals.
My arm hurt. But I wanted to be a
quarterback.”
By sophomore year, Steve moved up
from number-eight quarterback to
number two. By his junior year, he was
BYU’s starting quarterback. In his senior
year, Steve received the Davey O’Brien
award for the most outstanding
quarterback in the country.
There were several other times in his
athletic career when his confidence
faltered. Each time, he wanted
desperately to quit. Each time, he
appealed to his father—who wouldn’t
let him.
One early challenge came while
playing baseball in middle school. “I
was thirteen,” Steve recalled. “I didn’t
get a hit the whole year, and it just got
more and more embarrassing. . . . Game
after game,
I couldn’t get a hit.” When
the season ended, Steve informed his
dad that he’d had it. “My dad looked me
straight in the eye and said, ‘
You cannot
quit. You have the ability, so you need to
go back and work this out.’ ” So Steve
and his dad went back to the field. “I
remember it being really cold and
miserable and rainy and sleet and snow,
and he’d be pitching the ball
and I’d be
hitting them.” By his senior year in high
school, as captain of the varsity baseball
team, Steve was batting .384.
The lesson that persistence eventually
delivers rewards was one on which
Steve relied in the four years he sat on
the bench with the San Francisco 49ers.
Rather than request a trade, Steve
apprenticed himself to Joe Montana, the
starting quarterback who captained the
team to four Super Bowl victories. “If I
was ever going to find out just how good
I could get, I needed to stay in San
Francisco and learn, even if it was
brutally hard to do. . . . I many times
thought about quitting. . . . I heard boos
during my sleepless nights, but I feared
calling my dad. I knew what he’d say:
‘
Endure to the end, Steve.’ ”
At this point in my narrative of Steve
Young’s improbable ascent, you might
conclude that parents of gritty children
are authoritarian. You
might leap to the
conclusion that they’re centered on their
own standards and fairly insensitive to
their children’s particular needs.
Before you issue a final verdict,
though, sit down with Steve’s parents,
Sherry and LeGrande Young. And before
you do, take note that LeGrande prefers
the childhood nickname that aptly
captures his approach to life: “Grit.”
“He’s all about hard work and being
tough and not whining,” Steve’s brother
Mike once said of his father. “
The name
really fits him.”
As a corporate attorney, Grit Young
seldom missed a day of work. About
twenty-five years ago, Grit was working
out at his local YMCA when a fellow
gym-goer challenged him to an ongoing
sit-up competition. After a year, each
man could do about a thousand sit-ups
each, at which point the challenger
bowed out. By then, Grit was competing
against himself. He kept on, for years,
until he could do
ten thousand sit-ups in
a row.
When I called to talk to Steve’s
parents about their famous son and the
way they’d raised him, I expected
sternness and formality. The first thing
Sherry said was “We’re delighted to talk
to you! Our Steve is a great kid
!” Grit
then joked that, given my chosen field of
study, he was surprised it had taken me
so long to get to them.
My shoulders softened a bit, and I sat
back as each told me how they’d learned
to work hard early in life. “We were one
generation off the farm,” Sherry
explained. “There were expectations.”
Sherry was picking cherries by age ten.
Grit did the same, and to earn money for
baseball mitts and clothes, he mowed
lawns, delivered newspapers on his bike
to houses miles apart, and picked up
whatever farm work he could.
When it came time to raise their
children, both Sherry and Grit very
deliberately set out to provide the same
challenges. “My goal was to teach them
discipline,” Grit said, “and to go at
things hard like I learned to do. You
have to learn those things. They don’t
just happen. It was important to me to
teach the kids to finish what you begin.”
In no uncertain terms, Steve and his
siblings were made to understand that,
whatever they signed up for, they
had
 to
see it through to the end. “We told them,
you’ve got to go to all the practices. You
can’t say, ‘Oh, I’m tired of this.’ Once
you commit, you discipline yourself to
do it. There’s going to be times you
don’t want to go, but you’ve got to go.”
Sounds strict, right? It was. But if you
listen closely, you’ll discover that the
Youngs were also tremendously
supportive.
Steve tells the story of getting tackled
playing Pop Warner football as a nine-
year-old and looking up to see his mom,
still carrying her purse, striding right
past him to grab a boy on the opposing
team by the shoulder pads to tell him that
he would
not
 be illegally neck tackling
Steve again. As Steve and his siblings
got older, their home became a favorite
hangout. “Our basement was always
filled with kids,” Sherry says.
As a corporate attorney, Grit traveled
often. “Most guys I knew would stay for
the weekend, wherever we were,
because you wouldn’t be finished with
your business on Friday, and you had to
start again on Monday. Not me. I always,
always
 did everything I could to get
home for the weekend.” Occasionally,
weekend trips home were also
demonstrations of the character that had
earned Grit his nickname: “Once I was
in Montana negotiating with an aluminum
plant. Friday night, I take a taxi down to
the airport, and it’s all fogged in. All the
flights were canceled.”
I considered what I might do in the
same situation, and then blushed a bit as
I listened to the rest of the story. Grit
rented a car, drove to Spokane, took a
flight to Seattle, then a second flight to
San Francisco, and finally a third flight
—a red-eye that arrived at JFK the next
morning at dawn. He then got in another
rental car and drove back to Greenwich,
Connecticut. “I’m not patting myself on
the back,” Grit said. “It’s just that I
thought it was important to be with the
kids, to support them, whether it was
athletic activities or anything else.”
Sherry and Grit were also attuned to
their children’s emotional needs. Steve,
for example, was especially anxious.
“We noticed there were things he
wouldn’t do,” Grit said. “When he was
in second grade, he refused to go to
school. When he was twelve, he
wouldn’t go to Boy Scout camp. He
never slept over at another kid’s house.
He just wouldn’t do it.”
It was hard for me to square the
image of Steve Young, fearless all-star
quarterback, with the timid boy Sherry
and Grit were describing. Likewise,
neither Sherry nor Grit had any idea
what to make of their oldest son’s
fearfulness. One time, Grit says, he went
to pick up Steve from school to take him
to his uncle and aunt’s house for the day,
and Steve simply couldn’t stop sobbing.
He was petrified to be away from his
own home. Grit was flabbergasted. I
waited to hear how he and Sherry
reacted. Did they tell their son to man
up? Did they remove some of his
privileges?
No and no. Grit’s description of the
talk he had with his son when Steve
refused to go to school makes it clear
Grit did more questioning and listening
than lecturing and criticizing: “I said,
‘Well, is somebody picking on you?’ He
says, ‘No.’ Do you like your teacher? ‘I
love my teacher.’ Well, why don’t you go
to school? ‘I don’t know. I just don’t
want to go to school.’ ”
Sherry ended up sitting in Steve’s
second-grade classroom for weeks until,
at long last, Steve felt comfortable going
to school by himself.
“It was separation anxiety,” Sherry
told me. “At the time, we didn’t know
what to call it. But we could tell he was
all tight inside, and we knew that he
needed to work through all that.”
Later, when I asked Steve to
elaborate on his first troubled semester
at BYU, I pointed out that, if someone
heard only that anecdote and nothing
else, they might conclude that his father,
Grit, was a tyrant. What kind of parent
could refuse a son his plea to return
home?
“Okay,” Steve said. “All right.
Everything is contextual, right?”
I listened.
“The context was that my dad
knew
me. He knew all I wanted to do was
sprint home, and he knew that if he let
me do that, it would be letting me give
into my fears.
“It was a loving act,” Steve
concluded. “It was tough, but it was
loving.”
But it’s a fine line between tough love
and bullying, isn’t it? What’s the
difference?
“I knew the decision was mine,”
Steve said. “And I knew my dad didn’t
want me to be him. Number one, a parent
needs to set a stage that proves to the
child, ‘I’m not trying to just have you do
what I say, control you, make you be like
me, make you do what I did, ask you to
make up for what I didn’t do.’ My dad
showed me early that it wasn’t about him
and what he needed. It truly was ‘I’m
giving you all I got.’
“There was an underlying
selflessness to the tough love,” Steve
continued. “I think that’s vital. If any of
the tough love is about the parent just
trying to control you, well, kids smell it
out. In every way possible, I knew my
parents were saying, ‘We’re looking to
see
your
 success. We’ve left ourselves
behind.’ ”
If getting to know the Youngs helps you
understand that “tough love” isn’t
necessarily a contradiction in terms,
hold that thought—and meet Francesca
Martinez and her parents, Tina and Alex.
Named by the
Observer
 as one of the
funniest comics in Britain, Francesca
performs to sold-out audiences around
the world. In a typical routine, she
breaks the no-cussing rule of the Young
family, and after the show, she’s sure to
violate the drinking prohibition. Like her
parents, Francesca is a lifelong
vegetarian, not religious, and politically,
somewhere to the left of progressive.
Francesca was diagnosed with
cerebral palsy at age two. She prefers
the term “wobbly.” Told that their brain-
damaged daughter would “never lead a
normal life,” Tina and Alex quickly
decided that no doctor
could foretell
who their daughter might become.
Achieving comedic stardom takes grit no
matter who you are, but perhaps more so
when it’s a challenge merely to
enunciate your consonants or walk to the
stage. So, like other aspiring comics,
Francesca has endured four-hour drives
(each way) to perform for ten minutes
for no pay and made countless cold calls
to impassive and busy television
producers. But unlike most of her peers,
she needs to do breathing and voice
exercises before each show.
“I don’t take credit for my hard work
and passion,” she told me. “I think these
qualities
came from my family, which
was very loving and very stable. Their
overwhelming support and positivity are
why there is no limit to my ambition.”
Not surprisingly, counselors at
Francesca’s school were doubtful of
entertainment as a career path for a girl
who struggled to walk and talk at a
normal cadence. They were even more
wary of her dropping out of high school
to do so. “Oh, Francesca,” they’d say
with a sigh, “think about something more
sensible. Like computers.” The thought
of an office job was about as horrible a
fate as Francesca could imagine. She
asked her parents what she should do.
“Go and follow your dreams,” Alex
told his daughter, “and if they don’t work
out,
then you can reassess.”
“My mum was just as encouraging,”
Francesca said. Then, with a smile:
“Basically, they were happy for me to
leave formal education at sixteen to act
on television. They let me spend my
weekends clubbing with friends,
surrounded by leery men and cocktails
with sexually explicit names.”
I asked Alex about his “follow your
dream” advice. Before explaining, he
reminded me that Francesca’s brother
Raoul was also allowed to drop out of
high school—to apprentice himself to a
renowned portrait painter. “We never put
pressure on either of them to become
doctors or lawyers or anything like that.
I truly believe that when you do
something you really want to do, it
becomes a vocation. Francesca
and her
brother are incredibly hard workers, but
they feel passionately about their
subjects, so to them it’s not at all
oppressive.”
Tina agreed entirely: “I’ve always
had an instinctive sense that life and
nature and evolution have planted in
children their own capabilities—their
own destiny. Like a plant, if they’re fed
and watered in the right way, they will
grow up beautiful and strong. It’s just a
question of creating the right
environment—a soil that is nurturing,
that is listening and responsive to their
needs. Children carry within them the
seeds of their own future. Their own
interests will emerge if we trust them.”
Francesca connects the unconditional
support that her “absurdly cool” parents
lavished on her to the hope she
maintained even when hope seemed lost:
“So much of sticking with things is
believing you can do it. That belief
comes from self-worth. And that comes
from how others have made us feel in
our lives.”
So far, Alex and Tina seem the
epitome of permissive parenting. I asked
them whether they see themselves as
such.
“Actually,” Alex said, “I think I’m
allergic to spoiled children. Children
must be loved and accepted, but then,
without complications, they need to be
taught: ‘No, you cannot hit your sister on
the head with that stick. Yes, you must
share. No, you don’t get to have
everything you want when you want it.’
It’s no-nonsense parenting.”
As an example, Alex pushed
Francesca to do the physical therapy
exercises prescribed by her doctors. She
hated them. For years, she and her father
battled. Francesca couldn’t understand
why she couldn’t simply work around
her limitations, and Alex believed his
responsibility was to stand firm. As she
says in her book: “Though happy in
many ways, the next few years were
punctuated with intense rows replete
with door-banging and tears and
the
throwing of objects.”
Whether these skirmishes could have
been handled more skillfully is an open
question—Alex believes he could have
done a better job explaining to his young
daughter
why
 he was so insistent. That
may be
so, but what really strikes me
about this aspect of Francesca’s
childhood is the notion that an
affectionate, follow-your-dreams parent
can nevertheless feel compelled to lay
down the law on matters of discipline.
Suddenly, the one-dimensional view of
Alex and Tina as hippy-dippy parents
seems incomplete.
It was telling, for example, to hear
Alex, who is a writer, talk about the
work ethic he modeled for his children:
“To finish things, you have to put the
work in. When I was younger, I’d meet
many people who were writing stuff.
They’d say to me, ‘Oh yeah, I am a
writer as well but I’ve never finished
anything.’ Well, in that case, you are not
a writer. You are just somebody who sits
down and writes things on a bit of paper.
If you’ve got something to say, go ahead
and say it and finish it.”
Tina agrees that as much as children
need freedom, they also need limits.
She’s a tutor as well as an environmental
activist, and she’s watched a lot of
parents engage in what she calls
begging-and-pleading negotiations with
their children. “We taught our children to
live by clear principles and moral
guidelines,” she said. “We explained our
reasoning, but they always knew where
the boundaries were.
“And there was no television,” she
added. “I felt it was a hypnotic medium,
and I didn’t want it to replace
interactions with people. So we simply
didn’t have a television. If the children
wanted to watch something special, they
would walk over to their grandparents’.”
What can we learn from the stories of
Steve Young and Francesca Martinez?
And what can we glean from how other
grit paragons describe their parents?
In fact, I’ve noticed a pattern. For
those of us who want to parent for grit,
the pattern is a helpful blueprint, a guide
for making the many decisions we must
grapple with while raising our children.
Before I say more, let me repeat the
caveat that, as a scientist, I’d like to
collect many more data points before
coming to firm
conclusions. In a decade,
I should know a lot more about parenting
for grit than I do now. But because
there’s no pause button for parenting the
people we care about, I’ll go ahead and
tell you my hunches. In large part, I’m
encouraged to do so because the pattern
I’ve observed matches up with dozens of
carefully executed research studies on
parenting (but not grit). The pattern also
makes sense, given what’s been learned
about human motivation since John
Watson dispensed his
Don’t Coddle

’
em
advice. And, finally, the pattern I see
matches up with the interviews of
world-class athletes, artists, and
scholars completed by psychologist
Benjamin Bloom and his team thirty
years ago. Though parenting was not the
explicit focus of the Bloom study—
parents were originally included as
“observers to verify” biographical
details—the importance of parenting
ended up as one of its major
conclusions.
Here is what I see.
First and foremost, there’s no
either/or trade-off between supportive
parenting and demanding parenting. It’s a
common misunderstanding to think of
“tough love” as a carefully struck
balance between affection and respect
on the one hand, and firmly enforced
expectations on the other. In actuality,
there’s no reason you can’t do both. Very
clearly, this is exactly what the parents
of Steve Young and Francesca Martinez
did. The Youngs were tough, but they
were also loving. The Martinezes were
loving, but they were also tough. Both
families were “child-centered” in the
sense that they clearly put their
children’s interests first, but neither
family felt that children were always the
better judge of what to do, how hard to
work, and when to give up on things.
Below is a figure representing how
many psychologists now categorize
parenting styles. Instead of one
continuum, there are two. In the upper
right-hand quadrant are parents who are
both demanding and supportive. The
technical term is “
authoritative
parenting,” which, unfortunately is easily
confused with “authoritarian parenting.”
To avoid such confusion, I’ll refer to
authoritative parenting as
wise
parenting
,
because parents in this
quadrant are accurate judges of the
psychological needs of their children.
They appreciate that children need love,
limits, and latitude to reach their full
potential. Their authority is based on
knowledge and wisdom, rather than
power.

In the other quadrants are three other
common parenting styles, including the
undemanding, unsupportive approach to
raising children exemplified by
neglectful parents. Neglectful parenting
creates an especially toxic emotional
climate, but I won’t say much more
about it here because it’s not even a
plausible contender for how parents of
the gritty raise their children.
Authoritarian parents are demanding
and unsupportive, exactly the approach
John Watson advocated for strengthening
character in children. Permissive
parents, by contrast, are supportive and
undemanding.
When psychologist Larry Steinberg
delivered his 2001 presidential address
to the Society for Research on
Adolescence, he proposed
a moratorium
on further research on parenting styles
because, as he saw it, there was so much
evidence for the benefits of supportive
and demanding parenting that scientists
could profitably move on to thornier
research questions. Indeed, over the past
forty years, study after carefully
designed study has found that the
children of psychologically wise parents
fare better than children raised in any
other kind of household.
In one of Larry’s studies, for
example, about ten thousand American
teenagers completed questionnaires
about their parents’ behavior. Regardless
of gender, ethnicity, social class, or
parents’ marital status, teens with
warm,
respectful, and demanding parents
earned higher grades in school, were
more self-reliant, suffered from less
anxiety and depression, and were less
likely to engage in delinquent behavior.
The same pattern replicates in nearly
every nation that’s been studied and at
every stage of child development.
Longitudinal research indicates that the
benefits are measurable
across a decade
or more.
One of the major discoveries of
parenting research is that what matters
more than the messages parents aim to
deliver are the
messages their children
receive.
What may
appear
 to be textbook
authoritarian parenting—a no-television
policy, for example, or a prohibition
against swearing—may or may not be
coercive. Alternatively, what may
seem
permissive—say, letting a child drop out
of high school—may simply reflect
differences in the rules parents value as
important. In other words, don’t pass
judgment on that parent lecturing their
child in the supermarket cereal aisle. In
most cases, you don’t have enough
context to understand how the child
interprets the exchange, and, at the end
of the day, it’s the child’s experience that
really matters.
Are you a psychologically wise
parent? Use the
parenting assessment on
the next page, developed by psychologist
and parenting expert Nancy Darling, as a
checklist to find out. How many of these
statements would your child affirm
without hesitation?
You’ll notice that some of the items
are italicized. These are “reverse-
coded” items, meaning that if your child
agrees with them, you may be less
psychologically wise than you think.
Supportive: Warm
I can count on my parents to help me out
if I have a problem.
My parents spend time just talking to me.
My parents and I do things that are fun
together.
My parents don’t really like me to tell
them my troubles.
My parents hardly ever praise me for
doing well.
Supportive: Respectful
My parents believe I have a right to my
own point of view.
My parents tell me that their ideas are
correct and that I shouldn’t question
them.
My parents respect my privacy.
My parents give me a lot of freedom.
My parents make most of the decisions
about what I can do.
Demanding
My parents really expect me to follow
family rules.
My parents really let me get away with
things.
My parents point out ways I could do
better.
When I do something wrong, my parents
don’t punish me.
My parents expect me to do my best
even when it’s hard.
Growing up with support, respect, and
high standards confers a lot of benefits,
one of which is especially relevant to
grit—in other words, wise parenting
encourages children to
emulate
 their
parents.
To a certain extent, of course, young
children
imitate
 their mothers and
fathers. When we have nothing else to go
by, what other choice
do we have,
really, than to mimic the accents, habits,
and attitudes of the people around us?
We talk like they talk. We eat what they
eat. We adopt their likes and dislikes.
A young child’s instinct to copy
adults is very strong. In a classic
psychology experiment conducted more
than fifty years ago at Stanford
University, for example, preschoolers
watched adults play with a variety of
toys and then were given the opportunity
to play with the toys themselves. Half of
the boys and girls watched an adult
quietly play with Tinkertoys while
ignoring a child-size, inflatable doll in
the same room. The other half of the
children watched the adult begin
assembling the Tinkertoys and, after a
minute, turn to viciously attack the doll.
The adult pummeled the doll with his
fists and then a mallet, tossed the doll up
in the air and, finally, while screaming
and yelling, aggressively kicked the doll
about the room.
When given an opportunity to play
with the same toys, children who’d seen
adults play quietly followed suit. In
contrast, children who’d watched adults
beat up the doll were likewise
aggressive, in many cases so closely
imitating violent adults they’d seen
earlier that researchers described their
behavior
as virtual “carbon copies.”
And yet, there’s a world of difference
between
imitation
 and
emulation
.
As we grow older, we develop the
capacity to reflect on our actions and
pass judgment on what we admire and
disdain in others. When our parents are
loving, respectful, and demanding, we
not only follow their example, we revere
it. We not only comply with their
requests, we understand why they’re
making them. We become especially
eager to pursue the same interests—for
instance, it’s no coincidence that Steve
Young’s father was himself a standout
football player at BYU, or that
Francesca Martinez, like her father,
developed an early love of writing.
Benjamin Bloom and his team noted
the same pattern in their studies of
world-class performers. Almost without
exception, the supportive and demanding
parents in Bloom’s study were “models
of the work ethic in
that they were
regarded as hard workers, they did their
best in whatever they tried, they
believed that work should come before
play, and that one should
work toward
distant goals.” Further, “most of the
parents found it natural to encourage
their children to participate in their
favored activities.” Indeed, one of
Bloom’s summary conclusions was that
“
parents’ own interests somehow get
communicated to the child. . . . We found
over and over again that the parents of
the pianists would send their child to the
tennis lessons but they would take their
child to the piano lessons. And we found
just the opposite for the tennis homes.”
It’s indeed remarkable how many
paragons of grit have told me, with pride
and awe, that their parents are their most
admired and influential role models.
And it’s just as telling that so many
paragons have, in one way or another,
developed very similar interests to those
of their parents. Clearly, these exemplars
of grit grew up not just imitating their
parents but also emulating them.
This logic leads to the speculative
conclusion that not
all
 children with
psychologically wise parents will grow
up to be gritty, because not all
psychologically wise parents
model
grittiness. Though they may be both
supportive and demanding, upper-right-
quadrant moms and dads may or may not
show passion and perseverance for
long-term goals.
If you want to bring forth grit in your
child, first ask how much passion and
perseverance you have for your own life
goals. Then ask yourself how likely it is
that your approach to parenting
encourages your child to emulate you. If
the answer to the first question is “a
great deal,” and your answer to the
second is “very likely,” you’re already
parenting for grit.
It’s not just mothers and fathers who lay
the foundation for grit.
There’s a larger ecosystem of adults
that extends beyond the nuclear family.
All of us are “parents” to young people
other than our own children in the sense
that, collectively, we are responsible for
“bringing
forth”
the next generation. In
this role of supportive but demanding
mentors to other people’s children, we
can have a huge impact.
Technology entrepreneur Tobi Lütke
is a grit paragon who had such a mentor
in his life. Tobi dropped out of his
German high school when he was
sixteen without any memorably positive
learning experiences. As an apprentice
at an engineering company in his
hometown, he met Jürgen, a programmer
who worked in a small room in the
basement. Tobi affectionately described
Jürgen as “a long-haired,
fifty-
something, grizzled rocker who would
have been right at home in any Hells
Angels gang.” Under his tutelage, Tobi
discovered that the learning disabilities
he’d been diagnosed with as a failing
student did nothing to hamper his
progress as a computer programmer.
“Jürgen was a master teacher,” Tobi
said. “He created an environment in
which it was not only possible but easy
to move through ten years of career
development every year.”
Each morning, Tobi would arrive at
work to find a printout of the code he’d
written the day before, covered in red
marker with comments, suggestions, and
corrections. Jürgen was unsparing in
pointing out specific ways Tobi’s work
could be better. “This taught me not to
tangle my ego up in the code I write,”
Tobi said. “There are always ways to
improve it and getting this feedback is a
gift.”
One day, Jürgen asked Tobi to lead a
software assignment for General Motors.
The company gave Tobi extra money to
buy his first suit for the presentation and
installation. Tobi expected Jürgen to do
all the talking, but the day before the
installation, Jürgen casually turned to
Tobi and told him he had somewhere
else to be. Tobi would be visiting
General Motors alone. Full of
trepidation, Tobi went. The installation
was a success.
“This pattern kept on repeating
itself,” Tobi said. “Jürgen somehow
knew the extent of my comfort zone and
manufactured situations which were
slightly outside it. I overcame them
through trial and error, through
doing. . . . I succeeded.”
Tobi went on to found Shopify, a
software company that powers tens of
thousands of online stores and recently
exceeded $100 million in revenue.
In fact,
emerging research on teaching
suggests uncanny parallels to parenting.
It seems that psychologically wise
teachers can make a huge difference in
the lives of their students.
Ron Ferguson is a Harvard economist
who has collected more data comparing
effective and ineffective teachers than
anyone I know. In one recent study, Ron
partnered with the Gates Foundation to
study students and teachers in
1,892
different classrooms. He found that
teachers who are demanding—whose
students say of them, “My teacher
accepts nothing less than our best
effort,” and “Students in this class
behave the way my teacher wants them
to”—produce measurable year-to-year
gains in the academic skills of their
students. Teachers who are supportive
and respectful—whose students say,
“My teacher seems to know if something
is bothering me,” and “My teacher wants
us to share our thoughts”—enhance
students’ happiness, voluntary effort in
class, and college aspirations.
It’s possible, Ron finds, to be a
psychologically wise teacher, just as it’s
possible to be permissive, authoritarian,
or negligent. And it’s the wise teachers
who seem to promote competence in
addition to well-being, engagement, and
high hopes for the future.
Recently, psychologists
David Yeager
and Geoff Cohen ran an experiment to
see what effect the message of high
expectations in conjunction with
unflagging support had on students. They
asked seventh-grade teachers to provide
written feedback on student essays,
including suggestions for improvement
and any words of encouragement they
would normally give. Per usual, teachers
filled the margins of the students’ essays
with comments.
Next, teachers passed all of the
marked-up essays to researchers,
 who
randomly sorted them into two piles. On
half of the essays, researchers affixed a
Post-it note that read:
I’m giving you
these comments so that you’ll have
feedback on your paper
. This was the
placebo control condition.
On the other half of the essays,
researchers affixed a Post-it note that
read:
I’m giving you these comments
because I
have very high expectations
and I know that you can reach them.
This was the wise feedback condition.
So that teachers would not see which
student received which note, and so that
students would not notice that some of
their classmates had received a different
note than they had, researchers placed
each essay in a folder for teachers to
hand back to the students during class.
Students were then given the option to
revise their essays the following week.
When the essays were collected,
David discovered that about 40 percent
of the students who’d received the
placebo control Post-it note decided to
turn in a revised essay, compared to
about
twice
 that number—80 percent of
the students—who’d received the Post-it
note communicating wise feedback.
In a replication study with a different
sample, students who received the wise
feedback Post-it—“I’m giving you these
comments because I have very high
expectations and I know that you can
reach them”—made twice as many edits
to their essays as students in the placebo
control condition.
Most certainly, Post-it notes are no
substitute for the daily gestures,
comments, and actions that communicate
warmth, respect, and high expectations.
But these experiments do illuminate the
powerful motivating effect that a simple
message can have.
Not every grit paragon has had the
benefit of a wise father and mother, but
every one I’ve interviewed could point
to
someone
 in their life who,
at the right
time and in the right way, encouraged
them to aim high and provided badly
needed confidence and support.
Consider
Cody Coleman.
A couple of years ago, Cody sent me
an email. He’d seen my TED talk on grit
and wanted to know if we could talk
sometime. He thought perhaps his
personal story might be helpful. He was
majoring in electrical engineering and
computer science at MIT and was on the
cusp of graduating with a near-perfect
GPA. From his perspective, talent and
opportunity had very little to do with his
accomplishments. Instead, success had
been all about passion and perseverance
sustained over years and years.
“Sure, I said, “let’s talk.” Here’s
what I learned.
Cody was born thirty miles east of
Trenton, New Jersey, at the Monmouth
County Correctional Institution. His
mother was declared insane by the FBI
and, when Cody came along, was
imprisoned for threatening to kill a
senator’s child. Cody has never met his
father. Cody’s grandmother took legal
custody of Cody and his brothers, and
probably saved his life by doing so. But
she was not a prototypically wise
parent. She may have
wanted
 to be
loving and strict, but both her body and
mind were in decline. As Cody
describes it, he was soon doing more
parenting—and cooking and cleaning—
than she was.
“We were poor,” Cody explained.
“When my school did food drives, the
food went to my family, because we
were the poorest in the neighborhood.
And the neighborhood itself wasn’t all
that great. My school district scored
below average in every category
imaginable.
“To make matters worse,” Cody
continued, “I wasn’t really an athletic or
smart person. I started out in remedial
English classes. My math scores were
average, at best.”
And then what happened?
“One day, my oldest brother—he was
eighteen years older than me—he comes
home. It was the summer after my
freshman year in high school. He drove
up from Virginia to pick me up to spend
two
weeks with him, and on the drive
back to his place, he turns and asks me,
‘Where do you want to go to college?’ ”
Cody told him, “I don’t know. . . . I
want to go to a good school. Maybe
somewhere like Princeton.” And then
immediately, he took it back: “There’s
no way a school like Princeton would
accept me.”
“Why wouldn’t Princeton take you?”
Cody’s brother asked him. “You’re
doing all right in school. If you work
harder, if you keep pushing yourself, you
can get to that level. You have nothing to
lose by trying.”
“That’s when a switch flipped in my
head,” Cody said. “I went from ‘Why
bother?’ to ‘Why not?’ I knew I might not
get into a really good college, but I
figured, if I try, I have a chance. If I
never try, then I have no chance at all.”
The next year, Cody threw himself
into his schoolwork. By junior year he
was earning straight As. As a senior,
Cody set about finding the best college
in the country for computer science and
engineering. He changed his dream
school from Princeton to MIT. During
this transformative period, he met
Chantel Smith, an exceptionally wise
math teacher who all but adopted him.
It was Chantel who paid for Cody’s
driving lessons. It was Chantel who
collected a “college dorm fund” to pay
for the supplies he’d need once he
moved. It was Chantel who mailed
sweaters, hats, gloves, and warm socks
to him for the cold Boston winters, who
worried about him every day, who
welcomed him home each holiday break,
who stood by Cody at his grandmother’s
funeral. It was in Chantel’s home that
Cody first experienced waking on
Christmas morning to presents with his
name on them, where he decorated
Easter eggs for the first time, and where,
at the age of twenty-four, he had his first
family birthday party.
MIT wasn’t entirely smooth sailing,
but the new challenges came with an
“ecosystem of support,” as Cody put it.
Deans, professors, older students in his
fraternity, roommates, and friends—
compared to what he’d experienced
growing up, MIT was a haven of
attention.
After graduating with top honors,
Cody stayed on to get his master’s
in
electrical engineering and computer
science, earning a perfect GPA while
doing so and, at the same time, fielding
offers from doctoral programs and
Silicon Valley recruiters.
In deciding between an immediately
lucrative career and graduate school,
Cody did some hard thinking about how
he’d gotten to where he was. Next fall,
he’ll begin a PhD program in computer
science at Stanford. Here’s the first
sentence from his application essay:
“My mission is to utilize my passion for
computer science and machine learning
to benefit society at large, while serving
as an example of success that will shape
the future of our society.”
So, Cody Coleman did not have a
psychologically wise mother, father, or
grandparent. I wish he had. What he
did
have was a brother who said the right
thing at the right time, an extraordinarily
wise and wonderful high school math
teacher, and an ecosystem of other
teachers, mentors, and fellow students
who collectively showed him what’s
possible and helped him to get there.
Chantel refuses to take credit for
Cody’s success. “The truth is that Cody
has touched my life more than I’ve
touched his. He’s taught me that nothing
is impossible and no goal is beyond
reach. He’s one of the kindest human
beings I have ever met, and I couldn’t be
prouder when he calls me ‘Mom.’ ”
A local radio station recently
interviewed Cody. Toward the end of the
conversation, Cody was asked what he
had to say to listeners struggling to
overcome similar life circumstances.
“
Stay positive,” Cody said. “Go past
those negative beliefs in what’s possible
and impossible and just give it a try.”
Cody had these final words: “You
don’t need to be a parent to make a
difference in someone’s life. If you just
care about them and get to know what’s
going on, you can make an impact. Try to
understand what’s going on in their life
and help them through that. That’s
something I experienced firsthand. It
made the difference.”
I
. When I hear that, I sometimes interrupt with a
précis of Steve Maier’s research showing that,
in fact, finding a way
out
 of the suffering is
what does the strengthening.

Chapter 11
# The Playing
# Fields Of Grit
One day, when she was about four years
old, my daughter Lucy sat at the kitchen
table, struggling to open a little box of
raisins. She was hungry. She wanted
those raisins. But the top of that box
stubbornly resisted her efforts. After a
minute or so, she put down the unopened
box with a sigh and wandered off. I was
watching from another room, and I
nearly gasped.
Oh god, my daughter has
been defeated by a box of raisins! What
are the odds she’ll grow up to have any
grit?
I rushed over and encouraged Lucy to
try again. I did my best to be both
supportive and demanding.
Nevertheless, she refused.
Not long after, I found a ballet studio
around the corner and signed her up.
Like a lot of parents, I had a strong
intuition that grit is enhanced by doing
activities like ballet . . . or piano . . . or
football . . . or really any structured
extracurricular activity. These activities
possess two important features that are
hard to replicate in any other setting.
First, there’s an adult in charge—ideally,
a supportive and demanding one—who
is
not
 the parent. Second, these pursuits
are
designed
 to cultivate interest,
practice, purpose, and hope. The ballet
studio, the recital
hall, the dojo, the
basketball court, the gridiron—these are
the playing fields of grit.
The evidence on extracurricular
activities is incomplete. I cannot point to
a single study in which kids have been
randomly assigned to play a sport or
musical instrument, compete on the
debate team, hold an after-school job, or
work on the school newspaper. If you
think about it for a moment, you’ll
realize why. No parent wants to
volunteer their kids to do things (or not)
by the flip of a coin, and for ethical
reasons, no scientist can really force
kids to stay in (or out) of activities.
Nevertheless, as a parent and as a
social scientist, I would recommend that,
as soon as your child is old enough, you
find something they might enjoy doing
outside of class
 and sign them up. In
fact, if I could wave a magic wand, I’d
have all the children in the world engage
in at least one extracurricular activity of
their choice, and as for those in high
school, I’d require that they stick with at
least one activity for more than a year.
Do I think every moment of a child’s
day should be scripted? Not at all. But I
do think kids thrive when they spend at
least some part of their week doing hard
things that interest them.
Like I said, the evidence for such a bold
recommendation is incomplete. But the
research that
has
 been done is, in my
view, highly suggestive. Put it all
together, and you have a compelling case
for kids learning grit at the elbow of a
wise ballet instructor, football coach, or
violin teacher.
For starters, a few researchers have
equipped kids with beepers so that,
throughout the day, they can be prompted
to report on what they’re doing and how
they feel at that very moment. When kids
are
in class, they report feeling
challenged—but especially unmotivated.
Hanging out with friends, in contrast, is
not very challenging but super fun. And
what about extracurricular activities?
When kids are playing sports or music
or rehearsing for the school play, they’re
both
 challenged and having fun. There’s
no other experience in the lives of young
people that reliably provides this
combination of challenge and intrinsic
motivation.
The bottom line of this research is
this: School’s hard, but for many kids
it’s not intrinsically interesting. Texting
your friends is interesting, but it’s not
hard. But ballet? Ballet can be both.
In-the-moment experience is one thing,
but what about long-term benefits? Do
extracurriculars pay off in any
measurable way?
There are countless research studies
showing that kids who are more
involved in extracurriculars fare better
on just about every conceivable metric
—they earn better grades, have higher
self-esteem, are less likely to get in
trouble and so forth. A handful of these
studies are longitudinal, meaning that
researchers waited to see what
happened to kids later in life. These
longer-term studies come to the same
conclusion: more participation in
activities
predicts better outcomes.
The same research clearly indicates
that
overdosing
 on extracurriculars is
pretty rare. These days, the average
American teenager reports spending
more than three hours a day watching
television and
playing video games.
Additional time is drained away
checking social media feeds, texting
friends links to cat videos, and tracking
the Kardashians as they figure out which
outfit to wear—which makes it hard to
argue that time can’t be spared for the
chess club or the school play, or just
about any other structured, skill-focused,
adult-guided activity.
But what about grit? What about
accomplishing something that takes
years, as opposed to months, of work? If
grit is about sticking
with a goal for the
long-term, and if extracurricular
activities are a way of practicing grit, it
stands to reason that they’re especially
beneficial when we do them
for more
than a year
.
In fact, lessons learned while
working to improve from one season to
the next come up repeatedly in my
interviews with paragons of grit.
Here’s an example: After a lackluster
passing season his junior year of high
school football, future NFL Hall of
Famer Steve Young went down to the
high school woodshop and fashioned a
wooden football with tape for laces. In
one end, he screwed in an eye hook and
used that to latch the football to a weight
machine in the high school gym. Then,
gripping the ball, he’d move it back and
forth in a passing motion, the added
resistance developing his forearms and
shoulders. His passing yardage doubled
the next year.
Even more convincing evidence for
the benefits of long-term extracurricular
activities comes from a study conducted
by psychologist Margo Gardner. Margo
and her collaborators at Columbia
University followed eleven thousand
American teenagers until they were
twenty-six years old to see what effect,
if any, participating in high school
extracurriculars for two years, as
opposed to just one, might have on
success in adulthood.
Here’s what Margo found: kids who
spend more than a year in
extracurriculars are significantly more
likely to graduate from college and, as
young adults, to volunteer in their
communities. The hours per week kids
devote to extracurriculars also predict
having a job (as opposed to being
unemployed as a young adult) and
earning more money, but
only
 for kids
who participate in activities for two
years rather than one.
One of the first scientists to study the
importance of following through with
extracurricular activities—as opposed
to just dabbling—was Warren
Willingham.
In 1978,
Willingham was the director
of the Personal Qualities
Project. Even
today, this study remains the most
ambitious attempt ever to identify the
determinants of success in young
adulthood.
The project was funded by the
Educational Testing Service. ETS, as it’s
more commonly called, occupies a
sprawling campus in Princeton, New
Jersey, and employs more than a
thousand statisticians, psychologists, and
other scientists—all devoted to the
development of tests that predict
achievement in school and the
workplace. If you’ve taken the SAT,
you’ve taken an ETS test. Ditto for the
GRE, TOEFL, Praxis, and any one of
three dozen advanced placement exams.
Basically, ETS is to standardized testing
what Kleenex is to tissues: Sure, there
are other organizations that make
standardized tests, but most of us are
hard-pressed to think of their names.
So, what motivated ETS to look
beyond standardized tests?
Better than anyone, Willingham and
other scientists at ETS knew that,
together, high school grades and test
scores did only a half-decent job of
predicting success later in life. It’s very
often the case that two kids with
identical grades and test scores will end
up faring very differently later in life.
The simple question Willingham set out
to answer was
What other personal
qualities matter?
To find out, Willingham’s team
followed several thousand students for
five years, beginning in their senior year
of high school.
At the start of the study, college
application materials, questionnaires,
writing samples, interviews, and school
records were collected for each student.
This information was used to produce
numerical ratings for
more than one
hundred
 different personal
characteristics. These included family
background variables, like parent
occupation and socioeconomic status, as
well as self-declared career interests,
motivation for a college degree,
educational goals, and many more.
Then, as the students progressed
through college, objective measures of
success were collected across three
broad categories: First, did the student
distinguish him or herself academically?
Next, as a young adult, did this
individual demonstrate leadership? And,
finally,
to what extent could these young
men and women point to a significant
accomplishment in science and
technology, the arts, sports, writing and
speaking, entrepreneurism, or community
service?
In a sense, the Personal Qualities
Project was a horse race. Each of the
hundred-plus measures at the start of the
study could have ended up as the
strongest predictor of later success. It’s
clear from reading the first report,
completed several years before the final
data were collected, that Willingham
was entirely dispassionate on the issue.
He methodically described each
variable, its rationale for being
included, how it was measured, and so
on.
But when all the data were finally in,
Willingham was unequivocal and
emphatic about what he’d learned. One
horse did win, and by a long stretch:
follow-through
.
This is how Willingham and his team
put a number on it: “The follow-through
rating involved evidence of
purposeful,
continuous commitment to certain types
of activities (in high school) versus
sporadic efforts in diverse areas.”
Students who earned a top follow-
through rating participated in two
different high school extracurricular
activities for several years each and, in
both of those activities, advanced
significantly in some way (e.g.,
becoming editor of the newspaper,
winning MVP for the volleyball team,
winning a prize for artwork). As an
example, Willingham described a
student who was “on his school
newspaper staff for three years and
became managing editor, and was on the
track team for three years and ended up
winning an important meet.”
In contrast, students who hadn’t
participated in a single multiyear
activity earned the lowest possible
follow-through rating. Some students in
this category didn’t participate in any
activities at all in high school. But many,
many others were simply itinerant,
joining a club or team one year but then,
the following year, moving on to
something entirely different.
The predictive power of follow-
through was striking: After controlling
for high school grades and SAT scores,
follow-through in high school
extracurriculars predicted graduating
from college with academic honors
better than any variable. Likewise,
follow-through was the single best
predictor of holding an appointed or
elected leadership position in young
adulthood. And, finally, better than any
of the more than one hundred personal
characteristics Willingham had
measured, follow-through predicted
notable accomplishments for a young
adult in all domains, from the arts and
writing to entrepreneurism and
community service.
Notably, the
particular
 pursuits to
which students had devoted themselves
in high school didn’t matter—whether it
was tennis, student government, or
debate team. The key was that students
had signed up for
something
, signed up
again
 the following year, and during that
time had made some kind of
progress
.
I learned about the Personal Qualities
Project a few years after I started
studying grit. When I got my hands on the
original study report, I read it cover to
cover, put it down for a moment, and
then started again on page one.
That night, I couldn’t sleep. Instead, I
lay awake thinking:
Holy smokes! What
Willingham calls “follow-through”
sounds a lot like grit!
Immediately—desperately—I wanted
to see if I could replicate his findings.
One motive was practical.
Like any self-report questionnaire,
the Grit Scale is ridiculously fakeable.
In research studies, participants have no
real incentive to lie, but it’s hard to
imagine using the Grit Scale in a high-
stakes setting where, in fact, there’s
something to gain by pretending that “I
finish whatever I begin.” Quantifying grit
as Willingham had done was a
measurement strategy that could not
easily be gamed. Not, at least, without
outright lying. In Willingham’s own
words: “Looking for clear
signs of
productive follow-through is a useful
way to mine the student’s track record.”
But the more important goal was to
see whether follow-through would
predict the same showing-up-instead-of-
dropping-out outcomes that are the
hallmark of grit.
For the support of a new longitudinal
study, I turned to the largest
philanthropic funder in education: the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
I soon learned that the foundation is
especially interested in why college
students drop out in such large numbers.
At present, the dropout rate for two- and
four-year colleges in the United States is
among the highest in the world.
Escalating tuitions and the byzantine
labyrinth of financial aid in this country
are two contributing factors. Woefully
inadequate academic preparation is
another. Still, students with similar
financial circumstances and identical
SAT scores drop out
at very different
rates. Predicting who will persist
through college and earn their degree
and who won’t is among the most
stubborn problems in all of social
science. Nobody has a very satisfying
answer.
In a meeting with Bill and Melinda
Gates, I had an opportunity to explain my
perspective in person. Learning to
follow through on something hard in high
school, I said, seemed the best-possible
preparation for doing the same thing
later in life.
In that conversation, I learned that
Bill himself has long appreciated the
importance of competencies other than
talent. Back in the days when he had a
more direct role in hiring software
programmers at Microsoft, for instance,
he said he’d give applicants a
programming task he knew would
require hours and hours of tedious
troubleshooting. This wasn’t an IQ test,
or a test of programming skills. Rather, it
was a test of a person’s ability to muscle
through, press on, get to the finish line.
Bill only hired programmers who
finished what they began.
With generous support from the Gates
Foundation, I recruited 1,200 seniors
and, just as Willingham had done, asked
them to name their extracurricular
activities (if they
had
 any), when they’d
participated in them, and how they’d
distinguished themselves doing them, if
at all. Around the lab, while we were
doing this study, we began calling this
measure what it looks like:
the Grit
Grid.
Directions: Please list activities
in which you spent a significant
amount of time outside of class.
They can be any kind of pursuit,
including sports, extracurricular
activities, volunteer activities,
research/academic activities,
paid work, or hobbies. If you do
not have a second or third
activity, please leave those rows
blank:
Activity
Grade levels
of
participation
9-10-11-12
Achievements,
awards,
leadership
positions, if any






Following Willingham’s lead, my
research team calculated Grit Grid
scores by quantifying multiyear
commitment and advancement in up to
two activities.
Specifically, each activity students
did for two years or more earned a grit
point; activities students did for only one
year earned no points and weren’t
scored further. Activities that students
pursued for
multiple
 years and in which
they could point to some kind of
advancement (for example, member of
the student government one year and
treasurer the next) each earned a second
point. Finally, when advancement could
reasonably be deemed “high” versus just
“moderate” (president of the student
body, MVP of the basketball team,
employee of the month), we awarded a
third grit point.
In sum, students could score
anywhere from zero on the Grit Grid (if
they’d participated in no multiyear
commitments at all) to six points (if they
pursued two different multiyear
commitments and, in both, demonstrated
high achievement).
As expected, we found that students
with higher Grit Grid scores rated
themselves higher in grit, and so did
their teachers.
Then we waited.
After graduating from high school,
students in our sample ended up at
dozens of colleges throughout the
country. After two years, only 34 percent
of the 1,200 students in our study were
enrolled in a two- or four-year college.
Just as we expected, the odds of staying
in school depended heavily on Grit Grid
scores: 69 percent of students who
scored 6 out of 6 on the Grit Grid were
still in college. In contrast, just 16
percent of students who scored 0 out 6
were still on track to get their college
degrees.
In a separate study, we applied the
same Grit Grid scoring system to the
college
extracurriculars of novice
teachers. The results were strikingly
similar. Teachers who, in college, had
demonstrated productive follow-through
in a few extracurricular commitments
were more likely to stay in teaching and,
furthermore, were more effective in
producing academic gains in their
students. In contrast, persistence and
effectiveness in teaching had absolutely
no measurable relationship with
teachers’ SAT scores, their college
GPAs, or interviewer ratings of their
leadership potential.
Considered together, the evidence I’ve
presented so far could be interpreted in
two different ways. I’ve been arguing
that extracurricular
activities are a way
for young people to practice, and
therefore develop passion and
perseverance, for long-term goals. But
it’s also possible that following through
with extracurriculars is something only
gritty people do. These explanations
aren’t mutually exclusive: it’s entirely
possible that
both
 factors—cultivation
and selection—are at play.
My best guess is that following
through on our commitments while we
grow up both
requires
 grit and, at the
same time,
builds
 it.
One reason I think so is that, in
general, the situations to which people
gravitate tend to enhance the very
characteristics that brought us there in
the first place. This theory of personality
development has been dubbed the
corresponsive principle
 by Brent
Roberts, the foremost authority on what
leads to enduring changes in how people
think, feel, and act in different situations.
When Brent was a psychology
graduate student at Berkeley, the
prevailing view was that, after
childhood, personalities are more or
less “
set like plaster.” Brent and other
personality researchers have since
collected enough longitudinal data—
following, literally,
thousands
 of people
across years and decades—to show that
personalities do, in fact,
change after
childhood.
Brent and other personality
researchers have found that a key
process in personality development
involves situations and personality traits
reciprocally “calling” each other. The
corresponsive principle suggests that the
very traits that steer us toward certain
life situations are the very same traits
that those situations encourage,
reinforce, and amplify. In this
relationship there is the possibility of
virtuous and vicious cycles.
For instance, in one study, Brent and
his collaborators followed a thousand
adolescents in New Zealand as they
entered adulthood and found jobs. Over
the years, hostile adolescents ended up
in lower-prestige jobs and reported
difficulties paying their bills. These
conditions, in turn, led to
increases
 in
levels of hostility, which further eroded
their employment prospects. By contrast,
more agreeable adolescents
entered a
virtuous cycle of psychological
development. These “nice kids” secured
higher-status jobs offering greater
financial security—outcomes that
enhanced
 their
tendency toward
sociability.
So far, there hasn’t been a
corresponsive principle study of grit.
Let me speculate, though. Left to her
own devices, a little girl who, after
failing to open a box of raisins and
saying to herself, “This is too hard! I
quit!” might enter a vicious cycle that
reinforces giving up. She might learn to
give up one thing after another, each time
missing the opportunity to enter the
virtuous cycle of struggle, followed by
progress, followed by confidence to try
something even harder.
But what about a little girl whose
mother takes her to ballet, even though
it’s hard? Even though the little girl
doesn’t really
feel
 like putting on her
leotard at that moment, because she’s a
little tired. Even though, at the last
practice, her ballet teacher scolded her
for holding her arms the wrong way,
which clearly stung a bit. What if that
little girl was nudged to try and try again
and, at one practice, experienced the
satisfaction of a breakthrough? Might
that victory encourage the little girl to
practice
other
 difficult things? Might she
learn to welcome challenge?
The year after Warren Willingham
published the Personal Qualities Project,
Bill Fitzsimmons became the dean of
admissions at Harvard.
Two years later, when I applied to
Harvard, it was Bill who reviewed my
application. I know because, at some
point as an undergraduate, I found myself
involved in a community service project
with Bill. “Oh, Miss School Spirit!” he
exclaimed when we were introduced.
And then he ticked off, with remarkable
accuracy, the various activities I’d
pursued in high school.
I recently called Bill to ask what he
thought about extracurricular follow-
through. Not surprisingly, he was
intimately familiar with Willingham’s
research.
“I have it here somewhere,” he said,
seemingly scanning his bookshelf. “
It’s
never far from reach.”
Okay, so did he agree with
Willingham’s conclusions? Did Harvard
admissions really care about anything
other than SAT scores and high school
grades?
I wanted to know, because
Willingham’s opinion, at the time he
published his findings, was that college
admissions offices weren’t weighing
follow-through in extracurriculars as
heavily as his research suggested they
ought to be.
Each year, Bill Fitzsimmons
explained, several hundred students are
admitted to Harvard on the merits of
truly outstanding academic credentials.
Their early scholarly accomplishments
suggest they will at some point become
world-class academics.
But Harvard admits at least as many
students who, in Bill’s words, “have
made a commitment to pursue something
they love, believe in, and value—and
[have done] so with singular energy,
discipline, and
plain old hard work.”
Nobody in the admissions office
wants or needs these students to pursue
the same activities when they get to
campus. “Let’s take athletics as an
example,” Bill said. “Let’s say the
person gets hurt, or decides not to play,
or doesn’t make the team. What we have
tended to find is that all that energy,
drive, and commitment—
all that grit—
that was developed through athletics can
almost always be transferred to
something else.”
Bill assured me that, in fact, Harvard
was paying the utmost attention to
follow-through. After describing our
more recent research confirming
Willingham’s findings, he told me they
are using a very similar rating scale:
“We ask our admissions staff to do
exactly what it appears you’re doing
with your Grit Grid.”
This helped explain why he’d
maintained such a clear memory, more
than a year after he’d read my
application, of how I’d spent my time
outside of classes in high school. It was
in my
activities
,
as much as anything
else in my record, that he found evidence
that I’d prepared myself for the rigors—
and opportunities—of college.
“My sense, from being in admissions
for over forty years,” Bill concluded, “is
that most people are born with
tremendous potential. The real question
is whether they’re encouraged to employ
their good old-fashioned hard work and
their grit, if you will, to its maximum. In
the end, those are the people who seem
to be the most successful.”
I pointed out that extracurricular
follow-through might be a mere signal of
grit, rather than something that would
develop it. Bill agreed, but reaffirmed
his judgment that activities aren’t
just
 a
signal. His intuition was that following
through on hard things teaches a young
person powerful, transferable lessons.
“You’re learning from others, you’re
finding out more and more through
experience what your priorities are,
you’re developing character.
“In some cases,” Bill continued,
“students get into activities because
somebody else, maybe the parent, maybe
the counselor, suggests it. But what often
happens is that these experiences are
actually
transformative
, and the students
actually learn something very important,
and then they jump in and contribute to
these activities in ways that they and
their parents and their counselor never
would’ve imagined.”
What surprised me most about my
conversation with Bill was how much he
worried about the kids who’d been
denied the opportunity to practice grit in
extracurricular activities.
“More and more high schools have
diminished or eliminated arts and music
and other activities,” Bill told me, and
then explained that, of course, it was
primarily schools serving poor kids who
were making these cuts. “It’s the least
level playing field one could possibly
imagine.”
Research by Harvard political
scientist Robert Putnam and his
collaborators reveals that affluent
American high school students have
been participating in extracurricular
activities at consistently high
rates for
the past few decades. In contrast,
participation among poor students has
been
dropping precipitously.
The widening gap in extracurricular
participation between rich and poor has
a few contributing factors, Putnam
explains. Pay-to-play sports activities
like traveling soccer teams are one
obstacle to equal participation. Even
when participation is “free,” not all
parents can afford the uniforms. Not all
parents are able or willing to drive their
kids to and from practices and games.
For music, the cost of private lessons
and instruments can be prohibitive.
Just as Putnam would have predicted,
there is a worrisome correlation
between family income and Grit Grid
scores. On average, Grit Grid scores for
the high school seniors in our sample
who qualified for federally subsidized
meals were a full point lower than those
for students who were more privileged.
Like Robert Putnam, Geoffrey Canada is
a Harvard-trained social scientist.
Geoff is about as gritty as they come.
His passion is enabling kids growing up
in poverty to realize their potential.
Recently, Geoff has become something
of a celebrity. But for decades he toiled
in relative obscurity as the director of a
radically intensive education program in
New York City called the
Harlem
Children’s Zone. The first kids to make
it all the way through are now in college,
and the program’s unusually
comprehensive approach, coupled with
unusually successful results, has
attracted national attention.
A few years ago, Geoff came to Penn
to deliver our commencement speech. I
managed to shoehorn a private meeting
into his busy schedule. Given our limited
time, I got straight to the point.
“I know you’re trained as a social
scientist,” I began. “And I know there
are things we have tons of evidence for
and aren’t doing in education, and there
are things we have no evidence for and
keep doing
anyway. But I want to know,
from all you’ve seen and done, what you
really
 think is the way to dig kids out of
poverty.”
Geoff sat forward and put his hands
together like he was about to pray. “I’ll
tell you straight. I’m a father of four. I’ve
watched many, many kids who were not
my own grow up. I may not have the
random-assignment, double-blind
studies to prove it, but I can tell you
what poor kids need. They need all the
things you and I give to our own
children. What poor kids need is a lot.
But you can sum it up by saying that what
they need is
a decent childhood.”
About a year later, Geoff gave a TED
talk, and I was lucky enough to be in the
audience. Much of what Harlem
Children’s Zone did, Canada explained,
was based on rock-solid scientific
evidence—preschool education, for
instance, and summer enrichment
activities. But there’s one thing his
program provided without sufficient
scientific evidence to justify the
expense: extracurricular activities.
“You know why?” he asked.
“Because
I actually like kids.”
The audience laughed, and he said it
again:
“I actually like kids.”
“You’ve never read a study from MIT
that says giving your kid dance
instruction is going to help them do
algebra better,” he admitted. “But you
will give that kid dance instruction, and
you will be thrilled that that kid wants to
do dance instruction, and it will make
your day.”
Geoffrey Canada is right. All the
research I talked about in this chapter is
nonexperimental. I don’t know if there’ll
ever be a day when scientists figure out
the logistics—and ethics—of randomly
assigning kids to years of ballet class
and then waiting to see if the benefit
transfers to mastering algebra.
But, in fact, scientists
have
 done
short-term experiments testing whether
doing hard things teaches a person to do
other hard things.
Psychologist Robert Eisenberger at
the University of Houston is the leading
authority on this topic. He’s run dozens
of studies in which rats
are randomly
assigned to do something hard—like
press a lever twenty times to get a single
pellet of rat chow—or something easy,
like press that lever two times to get the
same reward. Afterward, Bob gives
all
the rats a different difficult task. In
experiment after experiment, he’s found
the same results: Compared to rats in the
“easy condition,” rats who were
previously required to work hard for
rewards subsequently demonstrate more
vigor and endurance on the second task.
My favorite of Bob’s experiments is
among his most clever. He noticed that
laboratory rats are generally fed in one
of two ways. Some researchers use
wire-mesh hoppers filled with chow,
requiring rats to gnaw at the food pellets
through small openings in the mesh.
Other researchers just scatter pellets on
the floor of the cage. Bob figured that
working for your supper, so to speak,
might teach rats to work harder on an
effortful training task. In fact, that’s
exactly what he found. He began his
experiment by training young rats to run
down a narrow plank for a reward.
Then, he divided the rats into two
groups. One group lived in cages with
hopper feeders, and the other in cages
where food pellets were scattered about
the floor. After a month of working to
obtain food from the hopper, rats
performed better on the runway task than
rats who instead merely wandered over
to their food when they were hungry.
Because his wife was a teacher, Bob
had the opportunity to try short-term
versions of the same experiments with
children. For instance, in one study, he
gave pennies to second and third graders
for counting objects, memorizing
pictures, and matching shapes. For some
children, Bob rapidly increased the
difficulty of these tasks as the children
improved. Other children were
repeatedly given easy versions of the
same tasks.
All the children got pennies and
praise.
Afterward, the children in both
conditions were asked to do a tedious
job that was entirely different from the
previous tasks: copying a list of words
onto a sheet of paper. Bob’s findings
were exactly the
same as what he’d
found with rats: children who’d trained
on difficult (rather than easy) tasks
worked harder on the copying task.
Bob’s conclusion? With practice,
industriousness can be learned.
In homage to the earlier work of
Seligman and Maier on learned
helplessness, where the inability to
escape punishment led animals to give
up on a second challenging task, Bob
dubbed this phenomenon
learned
industriousness
. His major conclusion
was simply that the association between
working hard and reward can be
learned. Bob will go further and say that
without
 directly experiencing the
connection between effort and reward,
animals, whether they’re rats or people,
default to laziness. Calorie-burning
effort is, after all, something evolution
has shaped us to avoid whenever
possible.
My daughter Lucy was still a baby when
I first read Bob’s work on learned
industriousness, and her sister, Amanda,
was a toddler. With both girls, I soon
discovered I was ill-suited to play the
role Bob had in his experiments. It was
difficult for me to create the necessary
contingency for learning—in other
words, an environment in which the
acknowledged rule was
If you work
hard, you’ll be rewarded. If you don’t,
you won’t.
Indeed, I struggled to provide the sort
of feedback I knew my children needed.
I found myself enthusiastically praising
them no matter what they did. And this is
one of the reasons extracurricular
activities offer superior
playing fields
for grit—coaches and teachers are
tasked with bringing forth grit in
children who are not their own.
At the ballet class where I dropped
off the girls each week, there was a
terrific teacher waiting to receive them.
This teacher’s passion for ballet was
infectious. She was every bit as
supportive as I was, and, frankly, a heck
of a lot more demanding. When a student
ambled in late to class, they got a stern
lecture about the importance of
respecting other people’s time. If a
student forgot to wear their leotard that
day, or left their ballet shoes at home,
they sat and watched the other children
for the entire class and weren’t allowed
to participate. When a move was
executed incorrectly, there were endless
repetitions and adjustments until, at last,
this teacher’s high standards were
satisfied. Sometimes, these lessons were
accompanied by short lectures on the
history of ballet, and how each dancer is
responsible for carrying on that
tradition.
Harsh? I don’t think so. High
standards? Absolutely.
And so it was in ballet class, more
than at home, that Lucy and Amanda got
to rehearse developing an interest,
diligently practice things they couldn’t
yet do, appreciate the beyond-the-self
purpose of their efforts, and, when bad
days eventually became good ones,
acquire the hope to try, try again.
In our family, we live by the Hard Thing
Rule. It has three parts. The first is that
everyone—including Mom and Dad—
has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is
something that requires daily deliberate
practice. I’ve told my kids that
psychological research is my hard thing,
but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get
better and better at being a real estate
developer; he does the same with
running. My oldest daughter, Amanda,
has chosen playing the piano as her hard
thing. She did ballet for years, but later
quit. So did Lucy.
This brings me to the second part of
the Hard Thing Rule: You can quit. But
you can’t quit until the season is over,
the tuition payment is up, or some other
“natural” stopping point has arrived.
You must, at least for the interval to
which you’ve committed yourself, finish
whatever you begin. In other words, you
can’t quit on a day when your teacher
yells at you, or you lose a race, or you
have to miss a sleepover because of a
recital the next morning. You can’t quit
on a bad day.
And, finally, the Hard Thing Rule
states that
you
 get to pick your hard
thing. Nobody picks it for you because,
after all, it would make no
sense to do a
hard thing you’re not even vaguely
interested in. Even the decision to try
ballet came after a discussion of various
other classes my daughters could have
chosen instead.
Lucy, in fact, cycled through a half-
dozen hard things. She started each with
enthusiasm but eventually discovered
that she
didn’t
 want to keep going with
ballet, gymnastics, track, handicrafts, or
piano. In the end, she landed on viola.
She’s been at it for three years, during
which time her interest has waxed rather
than waned. Last year, she joined the
school and all-city orchestras, and when
I asked her recently if she wanted to
switch her hard thing to something else,
she looked at me like I was crazy.
Next year, Amanda will be in high
school. Her sister will follow the year
after. At that point, the Hard Thing Rule
will change. A fourth requirement will
be added: each girl must commit to at
least one activity, either something new
or the piano and viola they’ve already
started, for at least
two years
.
Tyrannical? I don’t believe it is. And
if Lucy’s and Amanda’s recent comments
on the topic aren’t disguised apple-
polishing, neither do my daughters.
They’d like to grow grittier as they get
older, and, like any skill, they know grit
takes practice. They know they’re
fortunate to have the opportunity to do
so.
For parents who would like to
encourage grit without obliterating their
children’s capacity to choose their own
path, I recommend the Hard Thing Rule.

Chapter 12
# A Culture Of
# Grit
The first football game I ever watched
from beginning to end was Super Bowl
XLVIII. The game took place on
February 2, 2014, and pitted the Seattle
Seahawks against the Denver Broncos.
The Seahawks won, 43–8.
The day after their victory, Seahawks
head coach Pete Carroll was
interviewed by a former member of the
San Francisco 49ers.
“I know when I was with the (Forty-)
Niners,” the interviewer began, “you
were there. . . . It meant something to be
a Niner, not a football player. When you
and John Schneider are looking for a
player, tell me: What is that philosophy,
what does it mean to be a Seahawk?”
Pete chuckled softly. “I’m not going
to give it all to you, but . . .”
“Come on, man. Give it to me, Pete.”
“I will tell you that we’re looking for
great competitors. That’s really where it
starts. And that’s the guys that
really
have
grit
. The mindset that they’re
always going to succeed, that they’ve got
something to prove. They’re resilient,
they’re not going to let setbacks hold
them back. They’re not going to be
deterred, you know, by challenges and
hurdles and things. . . . It’s that attitude—
we really refer to it as
grit
.”
I can’t say I was surprised, either by
Pete’s comments or by his team’s
triumphant performance the day before.
Why not? Because nine months
earlier, I’d received a call from Pete.
Apparently, he’d just watched my TED
talk on grit. What prompted his call
were two urgent emotions.
First, he was curious—eager to learn
more about grit than I’d been able to
convey in the six minutes TED had
allotted me.
Second, he was annoyed. Not by most
of what I had to say. It was just the part
at the end that irked him. Science, I’d
confessed in that talk, had at that point
disappointingly little to say about
building grit. Pete later told me that he
just about jumped out of his chair,
practically yelling at my on-screen
image that building grit is
exactly
 what
the Seahawks culture is all about.
We ended up talking for roughly an
hour: me on one end of the line, sitting at
my desk in Philadelphia, and Pete and
his staff on the other, huddled around a
speakerphone in Seattle. I told him what
I was learning in my research, and Pete
reciprocated by telling me about what he
was trying to accomplish with the
Seahawks.
“Come and watch us. All we do is
help people
be great competitors. We
teach them how to persevere. We
unleash their passion. That’s
all
 we do.”
Whether we realize it or not, the culture
in which we live, and with which we
identify, powerfully shapes just about
every aspect of our being.
By culture, I don’t mean the
geographic or political boundaries that
divide one people from another as much
as the invisible psychological
boundaries separating
us
 from
them
. At
its core, a culture is defined by the
shared norms and values of a group of
people. In other words, a distinct culture
exists anytime a group of people are in
consensus about how we do things
around here and why. As for how the
rest of
the world operates, the sharper
the contrast, the stronger the bonds
among those in what psychologists call
the “in-group.”
So it is that the Seattle Seahawks and
the KIPP charter schools—as much as
any nation—are bona fide cultures. If
you’re a Seahawk, you’re not just a
football player. If you’re a KIPPster,
you’re not just a student. Seahawks and
KIPPsters do things in a certain way, and
they do so for certain reasons. Likewise,
West Point has a distinct culture—one
that is more than two centuries old, and
yet, as we’ll soon discover, continues to
evolve.
For many of us, the companies we
work for are an important cultural force
in our lives. For instance, growing up,
my dad liked to refer to himself as a
DuPonter. All the pencils in our house
were company-issued, embossed with
phrases like
Safety First
, and my dad
would light up every time a DuPont
commercial came on television,
sometimes even chiming in with the
voice-over: “Better things for better
living.” I think my dad only met the CEO
of DuPont a handful of times, but he’d
tell stories of his good judgment the way
you might speak of a family war hero.
How do you know you’re part of a
culture that, in a very real sense, has
become part of you? When you adopt a
culture, you make a
categorical
allegiance to that in-group. You’re not
“sort of” a Seahawk, or “sort of” a West
Pointer. You either are or you aren’t.
You’re
in
 the group, or
out
 of it. You can
use a noun, not just an adjective or a
verb, to describe your commitment. So
much depends, as it turns out, on which
in-group you commit to.
The bottom line on culture and grit is:
If you want to be grittier, find a gritty
culture and join it. If you’re a leader,
and you want the people in your
organization to be grittier, create a
gritty culture.
I recently called Dan Chambliss, the
sociologist we met in chapter 3 who
spent the first six years of his
professional life studying swimmers.
My question for Dan was whether, in
the three decades since his landmark
study of expertise, he’d changed his
mind about any of its provocative
conclusions.
Did he, for example, still believe
talent was largely a red herring when it
came to understanding the origins of
world-class excellence? Did he stand by
the observation that going from your
local club team to being competitive at
the state and national levels and, finally,
to world-class, Olympic-level expertise
necessitated qualitative improvements in
skill, not just “more hours” in the pool?
And was mystifying excellence, at the
end of the day, really the confluence of
countless, perfectly executed yet
mundane, doable acts?
Yes, yes, and yes.
“But I left out the most important
thing,” Dan said. “The real way to
become a great swimmer is to
join a
great team.”
That logic might strike you as strange.
You might assume that
first
 a person
becomes a great swimmer and
then
 he or
she joins a great team. And it’s true, of
course, that great teams don’t take just
anyone. There are tryouts. There are a
limited number of spots. There are
standards. And the more elite the team,
the fiercer the desire of those already on
the team to keep those standards high.
What Dan was getting at is the
reciprocal effect of a team’s particular
culture on the person who joins it. In his
many years in and out of the pool, he’d
seen the arrow of causality between a
great team and a great individual
performer go both ways. In effect, he’d
witnessed the corresponsive principle of
personality development: he’d seen that
the very characteristics that are selected
for certain situations are, in turn,
enhanced by them.
“Look, when I started studying
Olympians, I thought, ‘What kind of
oddball gets up every day at four in the
morning to go to swimming practice?’ I
thought, ‘These must be extraordinary
people to do that sort of thing.’ But the
thing is, when you go to a place where
basically
everybody
 you know is getting
up at four in the morning to go to
practice, that’s just what you do. It’s no
big deal. It becomes a habit.”
Over and over, Dan had observed
new swimmers join a team that did
things a notch or two better than what
they’d been used to. Very quickly, the
newcomer conformed to the team’s
norms and standards.
“Speaking for myself,” Dan added, “I
don’t have that much self-discipline. But
if I’m surrounded by people who are
writing articles and giving lectures and
working hard, I tend to fall in line. If I’m
in a crowd of people doing things a
certain way, I follow along.”
The drive to fit in—to conform to the
group—is powerful indeed. Some of the
most important psychology experiments
in history have demonstrated how
quickly, and usually without conscious
awareness, the individual falls in line
with a group that is acting or
thinking a
different way.
“So it seems to me,” Dan concluded,
“that there’s a hard way to get grit and an
easy way. The hard way is to do it by
yourself. The easy way is to use
conformity—the basic human drive to fit
in—because if you’re around a lot of
people who are gritty, you’re going to
act grittier.”
Short-term conformity effects are not
what excite me about the power of
culture to influence grit. Not exactly.
What excites me most is the idea that,
in the long run, culture has the power to
shape our identity. Over time and under
the right circumstances, the norms and
values of the group to which we belong
become our own. We internalize them.
We carry them with us.
The way we do
things around here and why
 eventually
becomes
The way I do things and why
.
Identity influences every aspect of
our character, but it has special
relevance to grit. Often, the critical
gritty-or-not decisions we make—to get
up one more time; to stick it out through
this miserable, exhausting
summer; to
run five miles with our teammates when
on our own we might only run three—
are a matter of identity more than
anything else. Often, our passion and
perseverance do not spring from a cold,
calculating analysis of the costs and
benefits of alternatives. Rather, the
source of our strength is the person we
know ourselves to be.
James March, an expert on decision
making at Stanford University, explains
the difference this way: Sometimes, we
revert to cost-benefit analyses to make
choices. Of course, March doesn’t mean
that, in deciding what to order for lunch
or when to go to bed, we take out a pad
of paper and a calculator. What he
means is that, sometimes when making
choices, we take into consideration how
we might benefit, and what we’ll have to
pay, and how likely it is that these
benefits and costs will be what we think
they’ll be. We can do all of this in our
heads, and indeed, when I’m deciding
what to order for lunch or when to go to
bed, I often think through the pros and
the cons before making a decision. It’s
very logical.
But other times, March says, we don’t
think through the consequences of our
actions at all. We don’t ask ourselves:
What are the benefits? What are the
costs? What are the risks?
 Instead, we
ask ourselves:
Who am I? What is this
situation? What does someone like me
do in a situation like this?
Here’s an example:
Tom Deierlein introduced himself to
me this way: “
I am a West Pointer,
Airborne Ranger, and two-time CEO. I
founded and run a nonprofit. I am not
special or extraordinary in any way.
Except one: grit.”
On active duty in Baghdad during the
summer of 2006, Tom was shot by a
sniper. The bullet shattered his pelvis
and sacrum. There was no way to know
how the bones would knit back together
and what sort of functionality Tom might
have when they did. Doctors told him he
might never walk again.
“You don’t know me,” Tom replied
simply. And then, to himself, he
made a
promise to run the Army Ten-Miler, a
race he’d been training to run before he
was shot.
When, seven months later, he was
finally well enough to get out of bed and
begin physical therapy, Tom worked
fiercely, unrelentingly, doing all the
assigned exercises and then more.
Sometimes, he’d grunt in pain or shout
out encouragements to himself. “The
other patients were a little startled at
first,” Tom says, “but
they got used to it,
and then—all in good fun—they’d mock
me with fake grunts of their own.”
After a particularly tough workout,
Tom got “zingers,” sharp bolts of pain
that shot down his legs. “They’d only
last a second or two,” Tom says, “but
they’d come back at random times
throughout the day, literally making me
jump from the shock.” Without fail, each
day, Tom set a goal, and for a few
months, the pain and perspiration were
paying off. Finally, he could just barely
walk with a walker, then with just a
cane, then on his own. He walked faster
and farther, then was able to run on the
treadmill for a few seconds while
holding onto the railings, and then for a
full minute, and on and on until, after
four months of improving, he hit a
plateau.
“My physical therapist said, ‘You’re
done. Good job.’ And I said, ‘I’m still
coming.’ And she said, ‘You did what
you needed to do. You’re good.’ And I
said, ‘No, no, I’m still coming.’ ”
And then Tom kept going for a full
eight months beyond the point where
there were any noticeable
improvements. Technically, his physical
therapist wasn’t allowed to treat him
anymore, but Tom came back on his own
to use the equipment anyway.
Was there any benefit to those extra
months? Maybe. Maybe not. Tom can’t
say for sure that the extra exercises did
any good. He
does
 know that he was
able to start training for the Army Ten-
Miler the next summer. Before getting
shot, he’d aimed to run seven-minute
miles, completing the race in seventy
minutes or less. After getting shot, he
revised his goal: he hoped to run
twelve-minute miles and to finish in two
hours. His finish time? One hour and
fifty-six minutes.
Tom can’t say that running the Army
Ten-Miler—and, after that, two
triathlons—were decisions rooted in
costs and benefits, either. “I simply
wasn’t going to fail because I didn’t care
or didn’t try. That’s not who I am.”
Indeed, the calculated costs and
benefits of passion and perseverance
don’t always add up, at least in the short
run. It’s often more “sensible” to give up
and move on. It can be years or more
before grit’s dividends pay off.
And that’s exactly why culture and
identity are so critical to understanding
how gritty people live their lives. The
logic of anticipated costs and benefits
doesn’t explain their choices very well.
The logic of identity does.
The population of Finland is just over
five million. There are fewer Finns in
the world than New Yorkers. This tiny,
cold Nordic country—so far north that,
in the depth of winter, they get barely six
hours of daylight—has been invaded
numerous times by larger, more
powerful neighbors. Whether those
meteorological and historical challenges
contribute to how Finns see themselves
is a good question. Regardless, it is
undeniable that the Finns see themselves
as among the world’s grittiest people.
The closest word to
grit
 in Finnish is
sisu
 (pronounced
see-sue
). The
translation isn’t perfect. Grit specifies
having a passion to accomplish a
particular top-level goal
and
 the
perseverance to follow through.
Sisu
, on
the other hand, is really just about
perseverance. In particular,
sisu
 refers
to a source of inner strength—a sort of
psychological capital—that Finns
believe they’re born with by dint of their
Finnish heritage. Quite literally,
sisu
refers to the insides of a person, their
guts.
In 1939, Finland was the underdog in
the Winter War, battling a Soviet army
that boasted three times as many
soldiers, thirty times as many aircraft,
and a hundred times as many tanks.
Finnish troops held
their ground for
several months—dramatically longer
than the Soviets or anyone else might
have expected. In 1940,
Time
 magazine
ran a feature on
sisu
:
The Finns have something they
call
sisu
. It is a compound of
bravado and bravery, of ferocity
and tenacity, of the ability to keep
fighting after most people would
have quit, and to fight with the
will to win. The Finns translate
sisu
 as “
the Finnish spirit” but it is
a much more gutful word than that.
In the same year, the
New York Times
ran a feature called “Sisu: A Word That
Explains Finland.” A Finn explained his
countrymen to the journalist this way: “A
typical Finn is an obstinate sort of
fellow who believes in getting the better
of bad fortune by proving that
he can
stand worse.”
When I lecture on grit to my
undergraduate classes, I like to include a
brief digression on
sisu
. I ask my
students the rhetorical question: Can we
forge a culture—as Seahawks coach
Pete Carroll clearly thinks we can—that
celebrates and supports such qualities as
sisu
 and grit?
A few years ago, by complete
coincidence, a young Finnish woman
named Emilia Lahti was in the audience
when I mentioned
sisu
. After the lecture,
she rushed to greet me and confirmed
that my outsider view of
sisu
 was
correct. We agreed there was a pressing
need for a systematic investigation of
sisu
, how Finns think about it, how it’s
propagated.
Emilia became my graduate student
the next year, completing her master’s
thesis on exactly those questions. She
asked a thousand Finns how they thought
about
sisu
 and discovered that most have
a growth mindset about its development.
When asked, “Do you think
sisu
 can be
learned or developed through conscious
effort?” 83 percent said, “Yes.” One
respondent then offered: “For example,
participation in Finnish scouting
association jaunts, where thirteen-year-
olds may be in
charge of ten-year-olds
alone in the woods, seems to have some
correlation with
sisu
.”
As a scientist, I don’t take seriously
the notion that Finns, or members of any
other nationality, have actual reserves of
energy hidden in their intestines,
awaiting release at the critical moment.
Still, there are two powerful lessons we
can take from
sisu
.
First, thinking of yourself as someone
who is able to overcome tremendous
adversity often leads to behavior that
confirms that self-conception. If you’re a
Finn with that “
sisu
 spirit,” you get up
again no matter what. Likewise, if
you’re a Seattle Seahawk, you’re a
competitor. You have what it takes to
succeed. You don’t let setbacks hold you
back. Grit is who you are.
Second, even if the idea of an actual
inner energy source is preposterous, the
metaphor couldn’t be more apt. It
sometimes feels like we have nothing
left to give, and yet, in those dark and
desperate moments, we find that if we
just keep putting one foot in front of the
other, there
is
 a way to accomplish what
all reason seems to argue against.
The idea of
sisu
 has been integral to
Finnish culture for centuries. But
cultures can be created in much shorter
time frames. In my quest to understand
what gives rise to grit, I’ve encountered
a few organizations with especially
gritty leaders at the helm who, in my
view, have successfully forged a culture
of grit.
Consider, for example, Jamie Dimon,
the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Jamie isn’t
the only one of the bank’s 250,000-plus
employees who says, “
I wear this jersey
and I bleed this blood.” Other
employees much lower in the ranks say
things like “What I do every day for our
clients actually matters.
No one here is
insignificant. And every detail, every
employee, matters. . . . I am proud to be
part of this great company.”
Jamie has been the CEO of JPMorgan
Chase, the largest bank in the United
States, for more than a decade. In the
2008 financial crisis,
Jamie steered his
bank to safety, and while other banks
collapsed entirely, JPMorgan Chase
somehow turned a $5 billion profit.
Coincidentally, the motto of Jamie’s
prep school alma mater, the Browning
School, is “
grytte,” an Old English
version of
grit
 defined in an 1897
yearbook as “firmness, courage,
determination . . . which alone win the
crown of genuine success in all
undertakings.” In Jamie’s
senior year at
Browning, his calculus teacher had a
heart attack, and the substitute teacher
didn’t know calculus. Half the boys quit;
the other half, including Jamie, decided
to stick with it and spent the entire year
in a separate classroom, alone, teaching
themselves.
“You have to learn to get over bumps
in the road and mistakes and setbacks,”
he told me when I called to talk about
the culture he’s built at JPMorgan Chase.
“Failures are going to happen, and how
you deal with them may be the most
important thing in whether you succeed.
You need fierce resolve. You need to
take responsibility. You call it grit.
I call
it fortitude.”
Fortitude is to Jamie Dimon what
sisu
 is to Finland. Jamie recalls that
getting fired from Citibank at age thirty-
three, and then taking a full year to
ponder what lessons to take from the
episode, made him a better leader. And
he believes in fortitude enough to make
it a core value for the entire JPMorgan
Chase bank. “
The ultimate thing is that
we need to grow over time.”
Is it really possible, I asked, for a
leader to influence the culture of such an
enormous corporation? True, the culture
of JPMorgan Chase has, with some
affection, been described as “the cult of
Jamie.” But there are literally thousands
and thousands of JPMorgan Chase
employees Jamie has never met in
person.
“Absolutely,” Jamie says. “It takes
relentless—absolutely relentless—
communication. It’s what you say and
how you say it.”
It may also be how
often
 you say it.
By all accounts, Jamie is a tireless
evangelist, crossing the country to
appear at what he calls town hall
meetings with his employees. At one
meeting he was asked, “What
do you
look for in your leadership team?” His
answer? “Capability, character, and
how
they treat people.” Later, he told me that
he asks himself two questions about
senior management. First: “Would I let
them run the business without me?”
Second: “Would I
let my kids work for
them?”
Jamie has a favorite Teddy Roosevelt
quote he likes to repeat:
It is not the critic who counts; not
the man who points out how the
strong man stumbles, or where the
doer of deeds could have done
them better. The credit belongs to
the man who is
actually in the
arena, whose face is marred by
dust and sweat and blood; who
strives valiantly; who errs, who
comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without
error and shortcoming; but who
does actually strive to do the
deeds; who knows great
enthusiasms, the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy
cause; who at the best knows in
the end the triumph of high
achievement, and who at the
worst, if he fails, at least fails
while daring greatly, so that his
place shall never be with those
cold and timid souls who neither
know victory nor defeat.
And here is how Jamie translates the
poetry of Roosevelt into the prose of a
JPMorgan Chase manual, titled
How We
Do Business
: “Have a fierce resolve in
everything you do.” “Demonstrate
determination, resiliency, and tenacity.”
“Do not let temporary setbacks become
permanent excuses.” And, finally, “Use
mistakes and problems as opportunities
to get better—
not reasons to quit.”
Anson Dorrance has the challenge of
instilling grit in considerably fewer
people. Thirty-one women, to be exact,
which is the full roster of the women’s
soccer team at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Anson is the
winningest coach in women’s soccer
history.
His record includes twenty-two
national championships in thirty-one
years of competition. In 1991, he
coached the U.S. Women’s National
Team to its first world title.
During his younger, playing days,
Anson was the captain of the UNC men’s
soccer team. He wasn’t especially
talented, but his full-throttle, aggressive
playing in every minute of practice and
competition earned the admiration of his
teammates, who nicknamed him Hack
and Hustle. His father once declared,
“Anson, you’re the most confident
person without any talent I’ve ever met.”
To which Anson quickly replied, “Dad,
I’m taking
that as a compliment.” Many
years later, as a coach, Anson observed
that “talent is common; what you invest
to develop that talent is the critical
final
measure of greatness.”
Many of Anson’s admirers attribute
his unprecedented success to
recruitment. “That’s simply incorrect,”
he told me. “We’re out-recruited by five
or six schools on a regular basis. Our
extraordinary success is about what we
do once the players get here.
It’s our
culture.”
Culture building, Anson said, is a
matter of continuous experimentation.
“Basically, we’ll try anything, and if it
works, we’ll keep doing it.”
For instance, after learning about my
research on grit, Anson asked each of his
players to fill out the Grit Scale and
made sure each received their score. “To
be honest, I was absolutely shocked.
With only one or two exceptions, the grit
ranking on your test is the way
I
 would
have evaluated their grit.” Anson now
makes sure the entire team scores
themselves on grit each spring so that
they have “a deeper appreciation for the
critical qualities of successful people.”
Each player gets to see her score
because, as Anson put it, “in some cases
the scale captures them, and in some
cases it
exposes
 them.” Returning
players take the scale again—and again
—each year so they can compare their
grit now to what it used to be.
Another experiment that stuck is
the
Beep Test, which begins every Tar Heel
season. All the players line up, shoulder
to shoulder, and at the sound of an
electronic beep, jog to a line twenty
meters away, arriving
in time for the
sound of another beep, which signals
them to turn around and jog back to
where they started. Back and forth they
run, picking up the pace as the interval
between the beeps gets shorter and
shorter. Within minutes, the players are
in a flat-out sprint—at which point, the
beeps come faster still. One by one,
players drop out, invariably falling to all
fours in utter exhaustion when they do.
How far they get, like everything else the
players do in training and competition, is
carefully recorded and, without delay,
posted in the locker room for everyone
to see.
The Beep Test was originally
designed by Canadian exercise
physiologists as a test of maximal
aerobic capacity, but gauging fitness is
only one reason Anson likes it. Like the
researchers at the Harvard Fatigue
Laboratory who, in 1940, designed a
treadmill test to assess perseverance
through physical pain, Anson sees the
Beep Test as a twofold test of character.
“I give a little speech beforehand about
what this is going to prove to me,” he
told me. “If you do well, either you have
self-discipline because you’ve trained
all summer, or you have the mental
toughness to handle the pain that most
people can’t. Ideally, of course, you
have both.” Just before the first beep,
Anson announces, “Ladies,
this is a test
of your mentality.
Go!”
How else does Anson build a culture
of grit? Like Jamie Dimon, he puts a lot
of stock in communication. It’s certainly
not the only thing that he does, but as a
philosophy and English major he has a
special appreciation for the power of
words: “For me,
language is
everything.”
Over the years, Anson has developed
a list of twelve carefully worded core
values that define what it means to be a
UNC Tar Heel, as opposed to just any
run-of-the-mill soccer player. “If you
want to create a great culture,” he told
me, “you have to have a collection of
core values that everyone lives.” Half
the team’s core values are about
teamwork. Half are about grit. Together,
they define a culture Anson and his
players refer to as “the competitive
cauldron.”
But a lot of organizations have core
values, I pointed out, that are
flagrantly
ignored on a daily basis. Anson agreed.
“Of course, there’s nothing motivational
about the statement that within your
culture you work hard. I mean, it’s so
banal
.”
His solution to rescuing core values
from banality was in some ways entirely
unpredictable and in other ways exactly
what you might expect from someone
with Anson’s humanities background.
Inspiration struck while Anson was
reading an article about Joseph Brodsky,
the Russian exile and Nobel laureate
poet. Brodsky, Anson learned, required
his graduate students at Columbia
University to memorize scores of
Russian poems each semester. Naturally,
most students considered this demand
unreasonable and antiquated, and they
marched into his office to tell him so.
Brodsky said they could do what they
liked, but if they didn’t memorize the
required verses, they wouldn’t get their
PhDs. “So they walked out of his
office,” Anson recalled, “with their tails
tucked firmly between their legs, and
they got to work.” What happened next
was, as Anson put it, “simply
transformational.” Quite suddenly, upon
committing a verse to memory,
Brodsky’s students “felt and lived and
breathed Russia.” What was dead on the
page had come to life.
Rather than read this anecdote and
quickly forget it, Anson immediately
appreciated its relevance to the top-
level goal he was trying to accomplish.
Like just about everything else he reads,
sees, or does, he asked himself,
How
can this help me develop the culture I
want?
Each year that you play soccer for
Anson Dorrance, you must memorize
three different literary quotes, each
handpicked to communicate a different
core value. “You will be tested in front
of the team in preseason,” his memo to
the team reads, “and then tested again in
every player conference. Not only do
you have to memorize them, but you have
to understand them. So reflect on them as
well. . . .”
By senior year, Anson’s athletes
know all twelve by heart, beginning with
the first core value—
We don’t whine
—
and its corresponding quote, courtesy of
playwright George Bernard Shaw: “The
true joy in
life is to be a force of fortune
instead of a feverish, selfish little clod
of ailments and grievances complaining
that the world will not devote itself to
making you happy.”
Verbatim memorization is a proud,
centuries-old tradition at West Point.
You can find the very, very long list of
songs, poems, codes, creeds, and
miscellany that all first-year cadets
—“plebes” in West Point parlance—are
required to memorize in a document
West Point calls
the Bugle Notes.
But West Point’s current
superintendent, Lieutenant General
Robert Caslen, is the first to point out
that words, even those committed to
memory, don’t sustain a culture when
they diverge from actions.
Take, for example, Schofield’s
Definition of Discipline. These words,
first spoken in an 1879 address to the
cadets by then superintendent John
Schofield, are the sort you’d expect a
West Pointer to know by heart. The
passage that cadets must memorize
begins: “The discipline which makes the
soldiers of a free country reliable in
battle is
not
 to be gained by harsh or
tyrannical treatment. On the contrary,
such treatment is far more likely to
destroy
than to make an army.”
Schofield goes on to say—and the
cadets must memorize this, too—that the
very same commands can be issued in a
way that inspires allegiance or seeds
resentment. And the difference comes
down to one essential thing: respect.
Respect of subordinates for their
commander? No, Schofield says. The
origin of great leadership begins with
the respect of the commander for his
subordinates.
The irony of reciting Schofield’s
uplifting words, even as you’re being
yelled and screamed at by
upperclassmen, was not lost on Caslen
when he committed them to memory as
an eighteen-year-old plebe in 1971. In
that era, hazing was not only tolerated
but encouraged. “It was the survivalists
who succeeded,” Caslen recalled. “It
wasn’t
so much the physical challenges
as the mental toughness required to cope
with all
the yelling and screaming.”
Indeed, forty years ago, 170 of the
cadets who started Beast Barracks quit
before it was over. That’s 12 percent,
double the proportion who dropped out
of Beast by the time I came to West Point
to study grit a decade ago. Last year,
attrition was down to
less than 2
percent.
One explanation for this downward
trend is hazing, or, rather, the lack
thereof. The practice of inflicting
physical and psychological stress on
first-year cadets was long considered a
necessary part of toughening up future
officers. A second benefit, so the logic
went, was to cull the weak, effectively
eliminating weakness in the corps by
pushing out those who couldn’t handle it.
Over the decades, the list of approved
hazing rituals was progressively
curtailed, and in 1990, hazing was
officially banned altogether.
So, eliminating hazing might explain
declining Beast attrition in the late
twentieth century, but what explains the
last decade’s precipitous drop? Is West
Point admissions doing a better job of
selecting for grit? From the year-to-year
data on grit I’ve seen, absolutely not.
The average grit scores of incoming
cadets haven’t changed since West Point
began collecting them.
According to General Caslen, what’s
happened at the academy is a deliberate
change in culture. “When only the
survivalists succeed, that’s an
attrition
model
,” he explained. “There’s another
kind of leadership. I call it a
developmental model
. The standards are
exactly the same—high—but in one
case, you use fear to get your
subordinates to achieve those standards.
And in the other case, you lead from the
front.”
On the battlefield, leading from the
front means, quite literally, getting out in
front with your soldiers, doing the same
hard work, and facing the same mortal
risks. At West Point, it means treating
cadets with unconditional respect and,
when they fall short of meeting the
academy’s extraordinarily high
standards, figuring out the support they
need to develop.
“For example,” Caslen explained,
“on the physical fitness test, if there are
cadets that struggle with the two-mile
run and I’m their leader, what I’m going
to do is sit down with them and put
together a training program. I’m going to
make sure the plan is sensible. Some
afternoons, I’m going to say, ‘Okay, let’s
go run,’ or ‘Let’s go workout,’ or ‘Let’s
go do intervals.’ I will lead from the
front to get the cadet to the standard.
Very often, the cadet who was unable to
do it on their own all of a sudden is now
motivated, and once they start to
improve, their motivation increases, and
when they meet those objectives they
gain even more confidence. At some
point, they figure out how to do things on
their own.”
Caslen’s example brought to mind a
story West Pointer Tom Deierlein told
me of the even-tougher-than-Beast
training he endured to become an
Airborne Ranger. At one point in the
training, he was hanging off a rock face
—a climb he’d already failed once—
with every muscle in his body shaking in
rebellion. “I can’t!” Tom shouted to the
Ranger instructor on the plateau above.
“I expected him to shout back, ‘That’s
right. Quit! You’re a loser!’ This guy, for
whatever reason, instead says, ‘Yes you
can! Get up here!’ And I did. I climbed
up, and I swore to myself I’d never say
‘I can’t’ again.”
As for critics of West Point’s new
developmental culture, Caslen points out
that the academic, physical, and military
standards for graduating from West Point
have, if anything, grown more stringent
over time. He’s convinced that the
academy is producing finer, stronger,
and more capable leaders than ever
before. “If you want to measure West
Point by how much yelling and
screaming goes on around here, then I’m
just going to let you complain. Young
men and women today just don’t respond
to yelling and screaming.”
Other than objective standards of
performance, what else
hasn’t
 changed
at West Point in the last ten years?
Norms of politeness and
decorum
remain so strong that, during my visit, I
found myself checking my watch to make
sure I was a few minutes early for each
appointment and, without thinking,
addressed every man and woman I met
by “sir” and “ma’am.” Also, the gray
full-dress uniforms worn by cadets on
formal occasions remain the same,
making today’s cadets part of the “long
gray line” of West Pointers stretching
back two centuries before them. Finally,
cadet slang is still spoken fluently by
West Pointers and includes such
improbably defined terms as
firsties
 for
“fourth-year cadets,”
spoony
 for “neat in
physical appearance,” and
huah
 for
everything from “I understand you” to
“gung ho” to “agreed” to “great job.”
Caslen isn’t so naive as to think that
four years of developmental culture at
West Point will reliably turn 2s and 3s
on the Grit Scale into 5s. But then again,
the varsity athletes, class presidents, and
valedictorians who make it through West
Point’s two-year admissions process
aren’t exactly the bottom of the barrel in
grit. Importantly, he’s seen people
change. He’s watched cadets develop.
He has a growth mindset. “You never
really know who is going to become a
Schwarzkopf or a MacArthur.”
Two years after Pete Carroll called to
talk about grit, I got on a plane to
Seattle. I wanted to see firsthand what
Pete meant when he said the Seahawks
were building the grittiest culture in the
NFL.
By then I’d read his autobiography,
Win Forever
, in which he talks about
discovering the power of passion and
perseverance in his own life:
Personally, I have learned that if
you create a
vision
 for yourself
and stick with it, you can make
amazing things happen in your life.
My experience is that once you
have done the work to create the
clear vision, it is the
discipline
and
effort
 to maintain that vision
that can make it all come true. The
two go hand in hand.
The moment
you’ve created that vision, you’re
on your way, but it’s the diligence
with which you stick to that vision
that
allows you to get there.
Getting that across to players is
a constant occupation.
I’d also watched Pete talk about grit and
culture in his many interviews. In one,
Pete is onstage in an auditorium at the
University of Southern California,
returning as an honored guest to the
school where he’d coached the USC
Trojans to a record six wins in seven
championship games over nine years.
“What’s new? What are you learning?”
Pete’s interviewer asked. Pete recounted
discovering my research on grit and its
resonance with his own decades-in-the-
making approach to coaching. “In our
program,” Pete said, his coaching staff
reinforces a culture of grit through
innumerable “competitive opportunities
and moments and illustrations. . . .
Really what we’re doing is we’re just
trying to make them more gritty. We’re
trying to teach them how to persevere.
We’re trying to illustrate to them how
they can demonstrate more passion.”
Then he gave an example. In practice,
Seahawks play to win—offensive and
defensive players compete against each
other with the full-throated aggression
and destroy-the-enemy intensity of a real
game. The ritual of weekly competition-
level practice, dubbed Competition
Wednesdays, can be traced back to
Anson Dorrance, whose book on
coaching Pete devoured when he was
crafting his own approach. “If you
thought of it as who was winning and
who was losing, you’d miss the whole
point. . . . It’s really the guy across from
us that makes us who we are.” Our
opponent, Pete explained, creates
challenges that help us become our best
selves.
Outsiders to Seahawks culture easily
miss that point. “Guys don’t understand
it right away,” Pete said. “They don’t get
it, but in time we work our way through
it.” For Pete, this means sharing—in the
most transparent way—everything that
goes on in his own head, his
objectives,
the reasoning behind his approach. “If I
didn’t talk about it, they wouldn’t know
that. They’d be thinking, ‘Am I going to
win or am I going to lose?’ But when we
talk about it enough, they come to an
appreciation of
why
 they compete.”
Pete admitted that some players may
have more to teach than they have to
learn. Seahawk free safety Earl Thomas,
for example, came to him as “the most
competitive, gritty guy you could ever
imagine. . . . He pushes and practices
with marvelous intensity. He focuses,
studies, does everything.” But the magic
of culture is that one person’s grit can
provide a model for others. On a daily
basis, Earl “demonstrates in so many
different ways what he’s all about.” If
each person’s grit enhances grit in
others, then, over time, you might expect
what social scientist Jim Flynn calls a
“social multiplier” effect. In a sense, it’s
the motivational analogue of the infinity
cube of self-reflecting mirrors Jeff
Bezos built as a boy—one person’s grit
enhances the grit of the others, which in
turn inspires more grit in that person,
and so on, without end.
What does Earl Thomas have to say
about being a Seahawk? “My teammates
have been pushing me since day one.
They’re helping me to get better, and
vice versa. You have to have a genuine
appreciation for teammates who are
willing to put in hard work, buy into the
system, and never be satisfied with
anything but continuing to evolve. It’s
incredible to see the heights we’re
reaching from that humble attitude.”
By the time I got around to visiting the
Seahawks’ training facility, my curiosity
had doubled. Making it to the
championship game in successive years
is notoriously hard, but the Seahawks
had defied the odds and made it to the
Super Bowl again that year. In sharp
contrast to the prior year’s win, which
Seattle fans celebrated with a blue and
green ticker-tape parade that was the
largest public gathering in Seattle’s
history, this year’s loss resulted in
howling, weeping, and the gnashing of
teeth—over what sports commentators
deemed “
the worst call in NFL history.”
Here’s a recap: With twenty-six
seconds on the clock, the Seahawks have
possession of the ball and are one yard
away from a game-winning touchdown.
Everyone expects Pete to call a running
play. It’s not just that the end zone is so
close. It’s also because the Seahawks
have Marshawn Lynch, whose nickname
is Beast Mode and who’s widely agreed
to be the single best running back in the
entire NFL.
Instead, Seahawks quarterback
Russell Wilson throws a pass, the ball is
intercepted, and the New England
Patriots take home the trophy.
Since Super Bowl XLIX was only the
third football game I’d watched without
interruption in my entire life—the
second being the NFC championship
game the Seahawks had won the week
before—I can’t offer an expert opinion
on whether, indeed, passing instead of
running was the epitome of coaching
misjudgment. What interested me more
when I arrived in Seattle was Pete’s
reaction and that of the whole team.
Pete’s idol, basketball coach John
Wooden, was fond of saying, “Success is
never final;
failure is never fatal. It’s
courage that counts.” What I wanted to
know is how a culture of grit continues
not just in the afterglow of success, but
in the aftermath of failure. What I wanted
to know is how Pete and the Seahawks
found the courage to continue.
As I look back on it now, my visit has an
“in the moment” feel:
My appointment begins with a
meeting in Pete’s office—yes, it’s the
corner office, but no, it’s not huge or
fancy, and the door is apparently
always
open, literally, allowing loud rock music
to spill out into the hallway. “Angela,”
Pete leans in to ask, “how can this day
be helpful to you?”
I explain my motive. Today I’m an
anthropologist, here to take notes on
Seahawks culture. If I had a pith helmet,
I’d be wearing it.
And that, of course, gets Pete all
excited. He tells me that it’s not just one
thing. It’s a million things. It’s a million
details. It’s substance and it’s style.
After a day with the Seahawks, I have
to agree. It’s countless small things, each
doable—but each so easy to botch,
forget, or ignore. And though the details
are countless, there are some themes.
The most obvious is language. One of
Pete’s coaches once said, “I speak fluent
Carroll.” And to speak Carroll is to
speak fluent Seahawk:
Always compete.
You’re either competing or you’re not.
Compete in everything you do. You’re a
Seahawk 24-7. Finish strong. Positive
self-talk. Team first.
During my day with the team, I can’t
tell you how many times someone—a
player, a coach, a scout—
enthusiastically offers up one of these
morsels, but I can tell you I don’t once
hear variations. One of Pete’s favorite
sayings is “No synonyms.” Why not? “If
you want to communicate effectively,
you need to be clear with the words you
use.”
Everybody I meet peppers their
sentences with these Carrollisms. And
while nobody has quite the neutron-
powered, teenage energy of the sixty-
three-year-old head coach, the rest of the
Seahawks family, as they like to call
themselves, are just as earnest in helping
me decode what these dictums actually
mean.
“Compete,” I’m told, is not what I
think it is. It’s not about triumphing over
others, a notion I’ve always been uneasy
about. Compete means excellence.
“Compete comes from the Latin,”
explains Mike Gervais, the competitive-
surfer-turned-sports-psychologist who is
one of Pete’s partners in culture
building. “Quite literally, it means
strive
together
. It doesn’t have anything in its
origins about another person losing.”
Mike tells me that two key factors
promote excellence in individuals
and in
teams: “deep and rich support and
relentless challenge to improve.” When
he says that, a lightbulb goes on in my
head. Supportive and demanding
parenting is psychologically wise and
encourages children to emulate their
parents. It stands to reason that
supportive and demanding leadership
would do the same.
I begin to get it. For this professional
football team, it’s not solely about
defeating other teams, it’s about pushing
beyond what you can do today so that
tomorrow you’re just a little bit better.
It’s about excellence. So, for the
Seahawks,
Always compete
 means
Be
all you can be, whatever that is for you.
Reach for your best.
After one of the meetings, an assistant
coach catches up to me in the hallway
and says, “I don’t know if anyone’s
mentioned
finishing
 to you.”
Finishing?
“One thing we really believe in here
is the idea of finishing strong.” Then he
gives me examples: Seahawks finish a
game strong, playing their hearts out to
the last second on the clock. Seahawks
finish the season strong. Seahawks finish
every drill strong. And I ask, “But why
just finish strong? Doesn’t it make sense
to start strong, too?”
“Yes,” the coach says, “but starting
strong is easy. And for the Seahawks,
‘finishing’ doesn’t literally mean
‘finishing.’ ”
Of course not. Finishing strong means
consistently focusing and doing your
absolute best at every moment, from start
to finish.
Soon enough, I realize it’s not only
Pete doing the preaching. At one point,
during a meeting attended by more than
twenty assistant coaches, the entire room
spontaneously breaks out into a chant, in
perfect cadence:
No whining. No
complaining. No excuses
. It’s like being
in a choir of all baritones. Before this,
they sang out:
Always protect the team
.
Afterward:
Be early
.
Be early? I tell them that, after
reading Pete’s book, I made “Be early” a
resolution. So far, I had yet to be early
for almost anything. This elicited some
chuckles. Apparently, I’m not the only
who struggles
with that one. But just as
important, this confession gets one of the
guys talking about why it’s important to
be early: “It’s about respect. It’s about
the details. It’s about excellence.” Okay,
okay, I’m getting it.
Around midday, I give a lecture on
grit to the team. This is after giving
similar presentations to the coaches and
the scouts, and before talking to the
entire front-office staff.
After most of the team has moved on
to lunch, one of the Seahawks asks me
what he should do about his little
brother. His brother’s very smart, he
says, but at some point, his grades
started slipping. As an incentive, he
bought a brand-new Xbox video-game
console and placed it, still in its
packaging, in his brother’s bedroom.
The deal was that, when the report card
comes home with A’s, he gets to unwrap
the game. At first, this scheme seemed to
be working, but then his brother hit a
slump. “Should I just give him the
Xbox?” he asks me.
Before I can answer, another player
says, “Well, man, maybe he’s just not
capable
 of A’s.”
I shake my head. “From what I’ve
been told, your brother is plenty smart
enough to bring home A’s. He was doing
it before.”
The player agrees. “He’s a smart kid.
Trust me, he’s a smart kid.”
I’m still thinking when Pete jumps up
and says, with genuine excitement: “First
of all, there is absolutely no way you
give that game to your brother. You got
him motivated. Okay, that’s a start.
That’s a beginning. Now what? He needs
some
coaching
! He needs someone to
explain what he needs to do,
specifically, to get back to good grades!
He needs a plan! He needs your help in
figuring out those next steps.”
This reminds me of something Pete
said at the start of my visit: “Every time
I make a decision or say something to a
player, I think, ‘How would I treat my
own kid?’ You know what I do best? I’m
a great dad. And in a way, that’s the way
I coach.”
At the end of the day, I’m in the
lobby, waiting for my taxi. Pete is there
with me, making sure I get off okay. I
realize I haven’t asked him directly how
he and the Seahawks found the courage
to continue after
he’d made “the worst
call ever.” Pete later told
Sports
Illustrated
 that it wasn’t the worst
decision, it was the “worst possible
outcome.” He explained that like every
other negative experience, and every
positive one, “it becomes part of you.
I’m not going to ignore it. I’m going to
face it. And when it bubbles up, I’m
going to think about it and get on with it.
And use it.
Use it!
”
Just before I leave, I turn and look up.
And there, twenty feet above us, in foot-
high chrome letters, is the word

Chapter 13
# Conclusion
This book has been about the power of
grit to help you achieve your potential. I
wrote it because what we accomplish in
the marathon of life depends
tremendously on our grit—our passion
and perseverance for long-term goals.
An obsession with talent distracts us
from that simple truth.
This book has been my way of taking
you out for a coffee and telling you what
I know.
I’m almost done.
Let me close with a few final
thoughts. The first is that you
can
 grow
your grit.
I see two ways to do so. On your
own, you can grow your grit “from the
inside out”: You can cultivate your
interests. You can develop a habit of
daily challenge-exceeding-skill practice.
You can connect your work to a purpose
beyond yourself. And you can learn to
hope when all seems lost.
You can also grow your grit “from the
outside in.” Parents, coaches, teachers,
bosses, mentors, friends—developing
your personal grit depends critically on
other people.
My second closing thought is about
happiness. Success—whether measured
by who wins the National Spelling Bee,
makes it through West Point, or leads the
division in annual sales—is not the only
thing you care about. Surely, you also
want to be happy. And while happiness
and success are related, they’re not
identical.
You might wonder, If I get grittier and
become more successful, will my
happiness plummet?
Some years ago, I sought to answer
this question by surveying two thousand
American adults. The graph below
shows how grit relates to life
satisfaction, measured on a scale that
ranged from 7 to 35 and included items
such as, “If I could live my life over, I
would change almost nothing.” In the
same study, I measured positive
emotions such as excitement and
negative emotions such as shame. I found
that the grittier a person is, the more
likely they’ll enjoy a healthy emotional
life. Even at the top of the Grit Scale,
grit went
hand in hand with well-being,
no matter how I measured it.
When my students and I published
this result, we ended our report this
way: “Are the spouses and children of
the grittiest people also happier?
What
about their coworkers and employees?
Additional inquiry is needed to explore
the possible downsides of grit.”
I don’t yet have answers to those
questions, but I think they’re good ones
to ask. When I talk to grit paragons, and
they tell me how thrilled they are to
work as passionately as they do for a
purpose greater than themselves, I can’t
tell whether their families feel the same
way.
I don’t know, for example, whether
all those years devoted to a top-level
goal of singular importance comes at a
cost I haven’t yet measured.
What I
have
 done is ask my
daughters, Amanda and Lucy, what it’s
like to grow up with a gritty mom.
They’ve watched me attempt things I’ve
never done before—like write a book—
and they’ve seen me cry when it got
really rough. They’ve seen how
torturous it can be to hack away at
innumerable doable, but hard-to-do,
skills. They’ve asked, at dinner: “Do we
always
 have to talk about deliberate
practice? Why does
everything
 have to
come back to your research?”
Amanda and Lucy wish I’d relax a
little and, you know, talk more about
Taylor Swift.
But they don’t wish their mother was
anything other than a paragon of grit.
In fact, Amanda and Lucy aspire to
achieve the same. They’ve glimpsed the
satisfaction that comes from doing
something important—for yourself and
others—and doing it well, and doing it
even though it’s so very hard. They want
more of that. They recognize that
complacency has its charms, but none
worth trading for the fulfillment of
realizing their potential.
Here’s another question I haven’t quite
answered in my research: Can you have
too
 much grit?
Aristotle argued that too much (or too
little) of a good thing is bad. He
speculated, for example, that too little
courage is cowardice but
too much
courage is folly. By the same logic, you
can be too kind, too generous, too
honest, and too self-controlled. It’s an
argument that psychologists Adam Grant
and Barry Schwartz have revisited. They
speculate that there’s an inverted-U
function that describes the benefits of
any trait, with the optimal amount being
somewhere
between the extremes.
So far, with grit I haven’t found the
sort of inverse U that Aristotle predicted
or that Barry and Adam have found for
other traits, like extroversion.
Regardless, I recognize that there are
trade-offs to any choice, and I can
appreciate how that might apply to grit.
It isn’t hard to think of situations in
which giving up is the best course of
action. You may recall times you stuck
with an idea, sport, job, or romantic
partner longer than you should have.
In my own experience, giving up on
piano when it became clear I had neither
interest in it nor obvious talent was a
great decision. I could have given up
even earlier, actually, and saved my
teacher from having to listen to me sight-
read all the pieces I hadn’t practiced the
week before. Giving up on becoming
fluent in French was also a good idea,
even though I did enjoy it and picked it
up more quickly than I did piano. Less
time spent on piano and French freed up
time for pursuits I found more gratifying.
So, finishing whatever you begin
without exception
 is a good way to miss
opportunities to start different, possibly
better, things. Ideally, even if you’re
discontinuing one activity and choosing
different lower-order goals, you’re still
holding fast to your ultimate concern.
One reason I don’t worry much about
an epidemic of grit is that such a
prospect seems so removed from our
current reality. How many days have you
come home from work and said to your
partner, “Gosh, everyone at the office is
just too gritty! They stick with their most
valued goals too long! They try too hard!
I wish they were less passionate!”
Recently, I asked three hundred
American adults to take the Grit Scale
and, after receiving their scores, to tell
me how they felt. Many
said they were
happy with their scores, and some
wanted to be grittier. Nevertheless, in
the entire sample, there wasn’t a single
person who, upon reflection, aspired to
be
less
 gritty.
I’m certain most of us would be
better off with more grit, not less. There
may be exceptions—grit outliers who
don’t need to be any grittier—but those
exceptions are rare.
I’ve been asked, on more than one
occasion, why I feel grit is the only thing
that matters. In fact, I don’t.
I can tell you, for example, that grit is
not
 the only thing I want my children to
develop as they round the corner from
childhood to maturity. Do I want them to
be great at whatever they do?
Absolutely. But greatness and goodness
are different, and if forced to choose, I’d
put goodness first.
As a psychologist, I can confirm that
grit is far from the only—or even the
most important—aspect of a person’s
character. In fact, in studies of how
people size up others, morality trumps
all other aspects of character in
importance. Sure, we take notice if our
neighbors seem lazy, but we’re
especially offended if they seem to lack
qualities like
honesty, integrity, and
trustworthiness.
So, grit isn’t everything. There are
many other things a person needs in
order to grow and flourish.
Character is
plural.
One way to think about grit is to
understand how it relates to other
aspects of character. In assessing grit
along with other virtues, I find three
reliable clusters. I refer to them as the
intrapersonal, interpersonal, and
intellectual
dimensions of character. You
could also call them strengths of will,
heart, and mind.
Intrapersonal character includes grit.
This cluster of virtues also includes self-
control, particularly as it relates to
resisting temptations like texting and
video games. What this means is that
gritty people
tend to be self-controlled
and vice versa. Collectively, virtues that
make possible the accomplishment of
personally valued goals have also been
called “performance character” or “self-
management skills.” Social commentator
and journalist David Brooks calls these
“resume virtues” because they’re the
sorts of things that get us hired and keep
us employed.
Interpersonal character includes
gratitude, social intelligence, and self-
control over emotions like anger. These
virtues help you get along with—and
provide assistance to—other people.
Sometimes, these virtues are referred to
as “moral character.” David Brooks
prefers the term “eulogy virtues”
because, in the end, they may be more
important to how people remember us
than anything else. When we speak
admiringly of someone being a “deeply
good” person, I think it’s this cluster of
virtues we’re thinking about.
And, finally, intellectual character
includes virtues like curiosity and zest.
These encourage active and open
engagement with the
world of ideas.
My longitudinal studies show these
three virtue clusters
predict different
outcomes. For academic achievement,
including stellar report card grades, the
cluster containing grit is the most
predictive. But for positive social
functioning, including how many friends
you have, interpersonal character is
more important. And for a positive,
independent posture toward learning,
intellectual virtue trumps the others.
In the end, the plurality of character
operates against any one virtue being
uniquely important.
I’m often asked whether encouraging grit
does children a disservice by setting
expectations unreasonably high.
“Careful, Dr. Duckworth, or children
will all grow up thinking they can be
Usain Bolt, Wolfgang Mozart, or Albert
Einstein.”
If we can’t be Einstein, is it worth
studying physics? If we can’t be Usain
Bolt, should we go for a run this
morning? Is there any point in trying to
run a little faster or longer than we did
yesterday? In my view, these are absurd
questions. If my daughter says to me,
“Mom, I shouldn’t practice my piano
today because I’ll never be Mozart,” I’ll
say in reply, “You’re not practicing
piano to be Mozart.”
We all face limits—not just in talent,
but in opportunity. But more often than
we think, our limits are self-imposed.
We try, fail, and conclude we’ve bumped
our heads against the ceiling of
possibility. Or maybe after taking just a
few steps we change direction. In either
case, we never venture as far as we
might have.
To be gritty is to keep putting one foot
in front of the other. To be gritty is to
hold fast to an interesting and purposeful
goal. To be gritty is to invest, day after
week after year, in challenging practice.
To be gritty is to fall down seven times,
and rise eight.
I was interviewed recently by a
journalist. As he was packing up his
notes, he said, “So, it’s obvious you
could have talked all day. You really
love this subject.”
“Oh, gosh. Is there
anything
 as
interesting as the psychology of
achievement? Could there be
anything
more important?”
He chuckled. “You know,” he said, “I
absolutely love what I do, too. It’s
amazing to me how many people I know
who’re well into their forties and
haven’t really committed to anything.
They don’t know what they’re missing.”
One final thought.
Earlier this year, the latest MacArthur
genius awards were announced. One of
the winners was Ta-Nehisi Coates, the
journalist whose second book,
Between
the World and Me
, has been an
extraordinary best seller.
Eight years ago, Coates was
unemployed, recently laid off by
Time
magazine, and scrambling to get
freelance work. It was a hard time. He
guesses he gained thirty pounds from the
strain. “I knew what kind of writer I
wanted to be. I was not becoming that
kind of writer. I was banging my head
against a wall and
nothing was coming
out.”
His wife, he says, was “unerringly
supportive.” Still, they had a young son.
There were practical realities. “I was
considering driving a cab.”
He finally got back on his feet, and
after pushing through the “extraordinary
stress” of his book, he began to hit his
stride. “The writing was very, very
different. The sentences had much more
power.”
In his three-minute video posted on
the MacArthur website, the first thing
Coates says is: “Failure is probably the
most important factor in all of my work.
Writing
is
 failure. Over and over and
over again.” Then he explains, that as a
boy, he was insatiably curious. Growing
up in Baltimore, he was particularly
obsessed with the idea of physical
safety, and the lack thereof, and has
remained so since. Journalism, he says,
lets him keep asking the questions that
interest him.
Toward the end of the video, Coates
offers the best description of what it’s
like to write that I’ve ever heard. To
give you a sense of his intonation, and
the cadence, I’ve laid out the words as
I
heard them—as a poem:
The challenge of writing
Is to see your horribleness on page.
To see your terribleness
And then to go to bed.
And wake up the next day,
And take that horribleness and that
terribleness,
And refine it,
And make it not so terrible and not so
horrible.
And then to go to bed again.
And come the next day,
And refine it a little bit more,
And make it not so bad.
And then to go to bed the next day.
And do it again,
And make it maybe average.
And then one more time,
If you’re lucky,
Maybe you get to good.
And if you’ve done that,
That’s a success.
You might think Coates is especially
modest. He
is
. But he’s also especially
gritty. And I’ve yet to meet a MacArthur
Fellow, Nobel laureate, or Olympic
champion who says that what they
achieved came in any other way.
“You’re no genius,” my dad used to
say when I was just a little girl. I realize
now he was talking to himself as much
as he was talking to me.
If you define genius as being able to
accomplish great things in life without
effort, then he was right: I’m no genius,
and neither is he.
But if, instead, you define genius as
working toward excellence, ceaselessly,
with every element of your being—then,
in fact, my dad
is
 a genius, and so am I,
and so is Coates, and, if you’re willing,
so are you.
# Acknowledgments
When I pick up a book for the first time,
I immediately flip to the
Acknowledgments. Like many readers,
I’m eager to peek behind the curtain; I
want to meet the cast and crew
responsible for the show. Writing my
own book has only deepened my
appreciation for the team effort that any
work represents. If you like this book,
please know that credit for its creation is
shared among the wonderful human
beings recognized here. It’s time for
these many supporters to step out into the
footlights for a moment and take a well-
deserved bow. If I’ve left anyone in the
wings, I apologize; any omissions are
inadvertent.
First and foremost, I want to thank my
collaborators. I wrote this book in the
first-person singular, using “I” when, in
fact, pretty much everything I’ve done as
a researcher or writer was
accomplished by a plurality. The “we”
who deserve credit—in particular
coauthors on published research—are
named individually in the Notes. On
their behalf, I extend a heartfelt thanks to
our research teams who, collectively,
made this research possible.
As for the book itself, I have three
individuals to thank in particular: First
and foremost, I am eternally grateful to
my editor, Rick Horgan, who improved
my writing and thinking more than I
thought was possible. If I’m lucky, he’ll
let me work with him again (and again).
Max Nesterak was my day-to-day editor,
research assistant, and conscience.
Put
simply, were it not for Max, this book
would not be in your hands today. And,
finally, my fairy godfather and agent,
Richard Pine, is the person who
originally, and finally, made this book a
reality. Eight years ago, Richard wrote
me an email asking, “Has anyone ever
told you that you ought to write a book?”
I demurred. Gritty and gallant, he kept
asking, but never pushing, until I was
ready. Thank you, Richard, for
everything.

visualization, Stephen is also the soul of
generosity and patience.
I am immensely grateful for the
unflagging support of so many
outstanding individuals at Simon &
Schuster. The only hard thing about
writing this book was the writing;
everything else, these remarkable folks
made easy. In particular, I’d like to thank
Nan Graham, whose optimism, energy,
and genuine affection for her authors
have no parallel. Katie Monaghan and
Brian Belfiglio masterfully orchestrated
a world-class publicity campaign,
ensuring that this book would end up in
your hands. For masterful handling of
this book’s production, I thank Carla
Benton and her team. David Lamb,
you’re a total pro; your commitment to
excellence at every stage of the editorial
process made all the difference. And,
finally, for this book’s beautiful cover, I
am grateful to Jaya Miceli.
Huge thanks to the world-class team
at InkWell Management, including Eliza
Rothstein, Lindsey Blessing, and Alexis
Hurley. You handle so much so well, and
with utter grace and professionalism.
Like the grit paragons profiled in this
book, I’ve benefited from especially
supportive and demanding teachers.
Matthew Carr taught me to write and to
love words. Kay Merseth reminded me,
at so many critical junctures, that each of
us is the author of our own life story.
Marty Seligman taught me that the right
question is at least as important as the
right answer. The late Chris Peterson
showed me that a true teacher is one
who puts students first. Sigal Barsade
showed me, in innumerable ways, what
it means to be a professor and how to be
a good one. Walter Mischel showed me
that at its apogee, science is an art. And
Jim Heckman taught me that genuine
curiosity is the best companion to true
grit.
I am deeply grateful to the institutions
and individuals who have supported my
research, including the National Institute
on Aging, the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, the Pinkerton Foundation,
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
the KIPP Foundation, the John Templeton
Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, the
Lone Pine Foundation, the Walton
Family Foundation, the Richard King
Mellon Family Foundation, the
University of Pennsylvania Research
Foundation, Acco Brands, the Michigan
Retirement Research Center, the
University of Pennsylvania, Melvyn and
Carolyn Miller, Ariel Kor, and Amy
Abrams.
The board and staff of the Character
Lab deserve special thanks because they
are the past, present, and most definitely
the future of all I do.
And, finally, thank you to my family.
Amanda and Lucy, your patience, good
humor, and stories made this book
possible. Mom and Dad, you gave up
everything for your children, and we
love you for that. Jason, you make me a
better person every day—this book is
for you.

Personality and Social
Psychology Bulletin

one-year longitudinal study, grit emerged as
a more reliable predictor of goal attainment
than any other measured personality
strength. Likewise, my colleagues Phil
Tetlock and Barbara Mellers have found in
their longitudinal research that people who
forecast future events with astonishing
accuracy are considerably grittier than
others: “The strongest predictor of rising
into the ranks of superforecasters is
perpetual beta, the degree to which one is
committed to belief updating and self-
improvement. It is roughly three times as
powerful a predictor as its closest rival,
intelligence.” See Philip E. Tetlock and Dan

deemed insufficiently bright
:
 I know two
other people whose tested aptitude wasn’t
particularly prognostic of what they would
go on to achieve. The first is Darrin
McMahon, an eminent historian at
Dartmouth College. In Darrin’s book,
Divine Fury: A History of Genius
 (New
York: Basic Books, 2013), he points out that
genius incites ambivalence. On one hand, the
idea that a few of us stand above the rest by
virtue of our God-given gifts holds timeless
appeal. On the other hand, we love the idea
of equality; we like to think we all have the
same chance of succeeding in life. In a
recent conversation on this topic, Darrin
told me, “What we are seeing play out now
is the democratization of genius. Part of us
wants to believe that everyone can be a
genius.” I was never a very good history
student, and sometimes I was a very poor
one. So I was more than a little surprised
that I couldn’t put Darrin’s book down. It
was
beautifully written. The meticulous research
and careful argumentation somehow did not
get in the way of it telling a story. And then,
at the very end, on page 243, I got to the
acknowledgments: “I have undoubtedly
suffered from many delusions in my life—
and undoubtedly suffer from many still. But
being a genius is not one of them.” Then
Darrin says, with humor and affection, that
when he was growing up, his parents saw to
it that their son “never got too big for his
britches.” And even more to the point, he
recalls being tested as a child for his
school’s gifted program. There were “shapes
and pictures and the like,” but the only thing
he remembers with certainty is “I didn’t
pass.” Darrin remembers watching his
classmates “trundle off each week to special
classes for the specially endowed.” And then
he reflects on whether getting labeled
nongifted was, in the end, a blessing or a
curse: “At an early age, I was told, with all
the objectivity of science, that I was not the
recipient of gifts. I might have just thrown in
the towel then and there, but I am a stubborn
sort, and I spent many years disputing the
verdict, working away to prove to myself and
to others, dammit, that I had not been
slighted at birth.” Similarly, Michael Lomax
was not easily identifiable as any kind of
prodigy. Nevertheless, he has an illustrious
résumé: he is president and CEO of the
United Negro College Fund, a leadership
position he has held for more than a decade.
Before that, Michael was president of
Dillard University. He has taught English at
Emory University, Spelman College, and
Morehouse College and was a two-time
mayoral candidate for the city of Atlanta.
“Honestly, I wasn’t considered the smartest
kid,” Michael told me recently. When he
was sixteen, his mother nevertheless wrote
to the president of Morehouse College to
ask whether her son could be admitted to its
prep school. “Of course, there was no prep
school at Morehouse!” Michael chuckled.
The Morehouse president decided, on the
basis of Michael’s outstanding grades, to
admit him as a freshman to the college. “I
got there. I hated it. I wanted to leave. I was
number one in my class, but I wanted to
transfer. I got it in my head that I would be a
better fit at Williams College, so I applied. I
had done everything, and they were about to
admit me, and then the director of
admissions said, ‘Oh, by the way, we need an
SAT score.’ ” Because he’d been admitted to
Morehouse without a formal application,
Michael had never taken the SAT before.
“That test was make-or-break for me. I sat
down and took it. And I didn’t do well.
Williams didn’t admit me.” So Michael
stayed at Morehouse and made the best of it,
graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in
English. Later, he earned his master’s degree
in English from Columbia University, and
his PhD in American and African American
literature from Emory University. Now
sixty-eight years old, Michael told me, “At
my age, I think it’s character more than
genius. I know all kinds of very talented
people who squander their great talents, or
who are dissatisfied and unhappy because
they think talent is enough. In fact, it ain’t
even
near
 enough. What I tell my kids, what
I try to tell my grandchildren, and anybody I
get a chance to mentor is this: It’s the sweat,
it’s the hard work, it’s
the persistence, it’s
the determination. It is the getting up and
dusting yourself off. That’s what it’s all
about.” In anticipation of hate mail about
this passage on gifted and talented programs,
let me say this: I am
wholeheartedly
 in
favor of giving kids all the intellectual
stimulation they can handle. At the same
time, I urge opening those programs to all
children who might benefit. Thirty years
ago, Benjamin Bloom said it best: “We in
this country have come to believe that we
can tell who’s going to be a great musician
by giving musical aptitude tests, who’s going
to be a great mathematician by giving
mathematics aptitude tests. Doing that
counts some people in and others out far too
early. . . . All the children should be given
opportunities to explore fields that they
might be interested in.” Ronald S. Brandt,

with Benjamin Bloom,”

Leadership

:
 The word
talent
 is used
differently by different people, but I think
the most intuitive definition is the one I’ve
offered here. For evidence that individuals
do differ in the rate at which they acquire
skills, see Paul B. Baltes and Reinhold
Kliegl, “Further Testing of Limits of
Cognitive Plasticity: Negative Age
Differences in a Mnemonic Skill Are

Developmental
Psychology

(1992): 121–25. See also Tom Stafford and

Science
, 25 (2014), 511–18. Finally, see the
work of David Hambrick and colleagues on
factors other than practice that likely
influence skill acquisition; for example, see
Brooke N. Macnamara, David Z. Hambrick,
and Frederick L. Oswald, “Deliberate
Practice and Performance in Music, Games,
Sports, Education, and Professions: A Meta-
Analysis,”

:
 For instance, in one
study, young adults wrote down their high-
level, mid-level, and low-level goals; over
the next two weeks, they reported on daily
frustrations. People whose goals
demonstrated a more organized, hierarchical
structure subsequently demonstrated greater
resilience in the face of daily frustrations. In
particular, when confronted with frustrating
experiences, they maintained a sense that
they were in control of attaining their goals.
In a related study, a more hierarchical goal
structure predicted feeling less anger and
annoyance in the face of daily frustrations
over the next two weeks. See Michael D.

CHAPTER 5: GRIT GROWS

:
 Psychologist Steve
Heine has done research showing that if you
think something is genetic, then you think it
is “natural” and therefore the way things
“should be.” For example, if you tell obese
people that obesity has a genetic basis, they
reduce their dieting efforts. See Ilan Dar-
Nimrod and Steven J. Heine, “Genetic
Essentialism: On the Deceptive
Determinism of DNA,”
Psychological
Bulletin
 137 (2011): 800–18. Perhaps
people would not have such a knee-jerk
reaction if they understood better that the
interplay
between genes and the
environment is complex and dynamic. The
interested reader might find the work of
Elliot Tucker-Drob on this topic especially
illuminating; for example, see Daniel A.

 Personal
communication with Robert Plomin, June
21, 2015. For a review of heritability of
personality traits, see Turkheimer,
Pettersson, and Horn, “Phenotypic Null
Hypothesis.” It’s worth noting that there are
behavioral genetics studies that do not rely
on twins, and also that heritability is a topic
too complex to fully summarize here. In
particular, there are interactions between
different genes, between genes and the
environment, and epigenetic effects.
Relatedly, there is an ongoing debate as to
the proportion of environmental influence
that can be attributed to parenting.
Definitively teasing apart the effects of
parenting from genetic heritage is difficult.
Chiefly, this is because you can’t randomly
swap human children to live with different
parents. However, you can do exactly that
with rat pups and their moms. You can, for
example, randomly assign rat pups to grow
up with very nurturing mothers or very
negligent ones. Neurobiologist Michael
Meaney has done exactly that, and he has
found that nurturing rats—who lick and
groom and nurse their pups more than
average—raise pups who are less stressed
when dealing with challenging situations.
The effects last into adulthood, and in fact,
rat pups who are born to low-lick moms but,
within twenty-four hours of birth, are
switched to be raised by high-lick moms,
grow up to be high-lick moms themselves.

Perspectives on Psychological
Science
 10 (2015): 282–306. In this
analysis of 271 independent samples,
totaling almost four million people from
thirty-one countries, a few key findings
emerged: IQ gains are ubiquitous and
positive over the past century; gains have
varied in magnitude by domain of
intelligence; gains have been less dramatic
in recent years; and, finally, candidate causes
include, in addition to social multiplier
effects, changes in education, nutrition,
hygiene, medical care, and test-taking
sophistication.

“Becoming Oneself: The Central Role of
Self-Concordant Goal Selection,”
Personality and Social Psychology Review
18 (2014): 349–65. See psychologist Ken
Sheldon’s work on enjoyment and
importance as the two components of what
he calls autonomously motivated goals. Ken
points out that all of us have responsibilities
we must fulfill out of obligation or
necessity. But no matter how much we think
we care about externally motivated goals,
their accomplishment rarely fulfills us in
the way that interesting and purposeful goals
do. A lot of the people in Ken’s studies are
highly educated and very comfortably upper-
middle-class yet sorely lacking in
autonomously motivated goals. They tell
Ken they feel like they’re in the passenger
seat of their own lives. By following these
individuals over time, Ken’s learned that
they’re less likely to accomplish their goals;
even when they do achieve them, they derive
less satisfaction from having done so.
Recently, I collected data from hundreds of
adults, ages twenty-five to seventy-five and
found that Ken’s measure of autonomous
motivation correlates positively with grit.

found that those who did more deliberate

comparing

that more quizzing produced no advantage.

of purpose because we already covered the
more self-oriented motivation of interest in

Archives of General

 62 (2005): 417–22. Some
patients struggle with the aspect of CBT that
involves trying to talk themselves out of
their negative self-talk. These patients say
things like: “In my head, I know it’s not fair
to call myself a loser. I’m labeling myself,
I’m engaging in all-or-nothing thinking. But
in my heart, part of me still feels like a loser
—like I’ll never be good enough.” A new
form of CBT, acceptance and commitment
therapy (ACT), addresses these concerns. In
ACT, the goal is simply to notice any
negative self-talk and accept that it exists,
while not letting it control your actions.

created the Hershey School, which owns a

 The predictive
validity of standardized achievement tests
for academic and professional outcomes is
well-documented. See the work of
psychologists Paul Sackett and Nathan
Kuncel in particular. My claim here is not
that achievement tests are invalid, per se, but
rather that they are an incomplete and
imperfect metric for what students know and
can do. See Angela L. Duckworth, Patrick D.
Quinn, and Eli Tsukayama, “What
No Child

and Self-Control in Predicting Standardized

playing fields for grit
:
 Even for those of us
who are beyond our high school and college
years, there are many activities we can sign
up for that offer challenge and support. For
example, I’ve learned a lot about grit from
Joe De Sena, founder of the Spartan Race.
Here’s a story from our interview: “We live
in Vermont. It gets very icy. My son is on the
ski team. One day, he comes in an hour
before lunch. He tells me he came in early
because he was cold.” It turns out that the
rest of the team was still out practicing.
“Okay,” Joe said to his son, “I understand
you’re cold. But you’re on the team, and the
team is skiing, so now you’re on my team,
and my team doesn’t take the chairlift.”
Father and son then proceed outside and
hike up the mountain on foot, the son upset
and complaining the whole way. And then
they skied down. Lesson over. “Sounds like
torture,” I said, half-joking. “The point was
not to torture him,” Joe replied. “The point
was to show him it could be a lot worse. We
never had that issue again because now he
had a frame of reference that said, ‘Okay,
this is uncomfortable, but it could be a lot
worse.’ ” Then Joe paused. “You know, I’ve
quit a race before. I learned there’s a lot
worse than dealing with the pain in front of
me. That’s a lesson you need help learning.
You’re not born knowing that.”

The original passage reads: “This is the true
joy in life, the being used for a purpose
recognized by yourself as a mighty one . . .
the being a force of Nature instead of a
feverish selfish little clod of ailments and
grievances complaining that the world will
not devote itself to making you happy.”

Personality and Social Psychology, Long

wanted to be grittier
:
 This data was collected
in 2015 and is not yet published.
honesty trumps all
:
 Geoffrey P. Goodwin,
Jared Piazza, and Paul Rozin, “Moral
Character Predominates in Person
Perception and Evaluation,”
Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology

(2014): 148–68.
character is plural
:
 I wish I could take credit
for the expression, “character is plural.” I
cannot. Many others have made the same
observation, including Christopher Peterson
and Martin Seligman in
Character
Strengths and Virtues
 (New York: Oxford
University Press, 2004), 10.
dimensions of character
:
 Daeun Park et al.,
“A Tripartite Taxonomy of Character:
Evidence for Interpersonal, Intrapersonal,
and Intellectual Competencies in Youth,”
(manuscript under review, 2015). Note that
these same three virtue clusters correspond,
roughly, to the Big Five personality
dimensions of conscientiousness,
agreeableness, and openness to experience.
tend to be self-controlled
:
 I see self-control
as related but distinct from grit. You can be
self-controlled about a goal that is not your
top-level, ultimate concern. And self-
control isn’t directly related to overcoming
setbacks and failures. However, both grit and
self-control are about achieving valued
goals. See Angela L. Duckworth and James
J. Gross, “Self-Control and Grit: Related but
Separable Determinants of Success,”
Current Directions in Psychological
Science
 23 (2014): 319–25. I personally
believe that self-control is an
extraordinarily important virtue, and to learn
more about strategies that facilitate it and
their benefits, see Walter Mischel,
The
Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control
(New York: Little, Brown, 2014), and Roy F.
Baumeister and John Tierney,
Willpower:
Rediscovering the Greatest Human
Strength
 (New York: Penguin, 2011).
“resume virtues”; “eulogy virtues”
:
 David
Brooks,
The Road to Character
 (New York:
Random House, 2015), xi.
world of ideas
:
 I haven’t touched upon
creativity in this book. In many endeavors,
creativity is absolutely essential, and I direct
the interested reader to Scott Barry
Kaufman and Carolyn Gregoire,
Wired to
Create: Unraveling the Mysteries of the
Creative Mind
 (New York: Perigee Books,
2015).
