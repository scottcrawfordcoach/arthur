The Power of
Mental Practices
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Visualization
The gift of the human brain is its inability to distinguish between
what is real and what is imagined.
So just imagine the possibilities!
Anything is possible.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
The Power of Positive Alternatives
Visualizations lay
down new neural
pathways that lead to
different beliefs and
behaviours.
Brain studies reveal that thoughts produce the same mental
instructions as
actions.

Mental Imagery
Visualization impacts cognitive processes
in the brain including:
★motor control
★attention
★perception
★planning
★memory
The brain is being primed for success
while increasing states of ﬂow—all relevant
to achieving and living the best life!
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
A Sensory Experience
Neuroscience has
demonstrated that the brain
can reproduce mental imagery
from all of the senses including:
sights, sounds, tastes, smells, pressures, textures,
temperatures and movements.
Visualization acts directly on the brain, altering brainwave
activity and biochemistry, and its effects branch out into
every aspect of life.

Visualization Scripts
Guided visualizations are a powerful way to manifest positive
outcomes. They can also be used to alleviate anxiety or stress by generating transformative mental images, pulling in sights, sounds, scents, tastes, and feelings.
There are different degrees to visualization scripts:
1.Generate images
2.Create relevant context around the imagery
3.Call attention to details and vivid sensory descriptions
of object(s) in the image.
4.Where applicable, transform imagery from negative and painful images to positive and healthy images

Muhammad Ali used different mental practices to enhance his
performance in the ring such as: afﬁrmation; visualization; mental
rehearsal; self-conﬁrmation; and maybe the most powerful mantra of
personal worth ever uttered: 'I am the greatest.'"
