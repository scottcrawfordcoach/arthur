Review: Topic
What are we trying to achieve in Topic?
Follow “the rule of 7”
A client needs time to
process their thoughts-
even when they present
with a “clear” goal.
Goals change and clarify
when we have a chance to twirl ideas around.
Move from T to H in +/- 7
minutes.

Intention & Purpose
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Decide!
“Whatever the mind can
conceive and believe, it can
achieve. You are the master of
your destiny. You can inﬂuence,
direct and control your own
environment. You can make your life what you want it to be.”
― Napoleon Hill, Think and Grow Rich
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Today’s focus
The process of effective goal setting:
✦ directs attention and therefore affects behavior.
✦ sets intentions both consciously and sub-consciously.
✦ clarifies desired outcomes.
✦ creates a vision that stretches the mind.
✦ is most effective when it builds on strengths.
✦differentiates between learning goals and performance goals.
Clarifying Goals
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Goals Direct Attention
Energy flows where focus goes.
✦ Myth: people who don’t set goals, don’t have goals.
We all have subconscious goals; goals we have not
articulated and yet drive our behaviour. As a coach, listen for the unspoken goals that drive a person’s behavior and eat
up their energy.
Example: Sam had a bad experience in a group when he
was young. He formed the belief that he does not fit into
groups well and groups are bad. His subconscious goal is to stay away from groups. That goal, although not spoken,
directs his focus, energy and behavior in life.

Clarity
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Clarity is a choice.
Clear goals are realized goals.
✦ Myth: having an idea of what I want is enough.
One of the main reasons people fail to progress in life is
because they are not clear about what they want.  The truth
is, effective goal-setting is not taught in schools or the home.
People who know what they want outperform those who don’t- hands down.
Clarity is a choice.  The default human condition is to live life without clarity. Most people wake up and see what the day
brings.  Clarity means you make a conscious choice to set
intention and purpose.
When you know where you want to end up,
you’ll easily figure out which direction to go.
-Tony Robbins
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Clarity is King!
This might be the most important thing you do
with your clients!
✦ Myth: setting goals is easy
Visualize The Ideal Outcome
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Step into success
The number one reason people fail to achieve
goals is lack of vision.
✦ Myth: knowing the steps to take doesn’t make it happen.
How many times have you heard someone say “I want to…. lose weight, take a
course, get a better job, get promoted…. They already know what to do! The goal goes deeper than the surface and your role as coach is to hone in.
I never hit a shot, not even in practice, without having a very sharp
focused picture of it in my head. It’s like a colour movie. First I “see” where I want it to finish, then “feel” the impact of connecting with the ball, then I “smell” the grass on the wind, then I “hear” the ball drop, and “taste” a hole-in-one!Arguably the greatest golfer in the world, Jack Nicklaus hones in on every
shot
Appreciative Goals
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Appreciative Goals
Powerful goals  are positive, affirmative and
build on strengths.
✦ Myth: A question is a goal.
When you ask someone what they want and the answer is,
I wonder if I should quit my job, or I need to figure out if I should go back to school.
*Also Important
Goals specify what you want, not what you don’t want.
Hedgehog vs Fox
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Hedgehog vs Fox
Goal-setters are hedgehogs driving forward with absolute clarity,
intention and purpose. People who don’t state their goals are like the
fox- scattered, diffused, and inconsistent.
Goal setters refine their intention and purpose daily.
✦Myth: setting goals is easy.
“When you get your Hedgehog
Concept right, it has the quiet ping of truth, like a single, clear,
perfectly struck note of a Mozart
piano concerto.”
- Jim Collins
What drives you? What do you
want to be
the best at in
the world? What are you
most passionate
about?
Learner vs Performance
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Learner vs Performance Goals
Behind every goal is a feeling. Get curious about
what feelings hold people back?
✦ Myth: A client has to have steps and “to-dos” at the
end of a “good” coaching session.
Performance goals focus on specific, measurable &
actionable outcome.
Learning goals focus on self development, learning,
awareness and growth.
