Defining Mindfulness
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Mindfulness Defined
Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on
purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.
(Kabat-Zinn)
Mindfulness reminds us of what we are supposed to be
doing; it sees things as they really are; and it sees the true
nature of all phenomena.
(Gunaratana)

ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Mindfulness as Awareness
Awareness of internal processes such as breathing, body
sensations, thoughts and feelings has been essential to the
various methods of teaching Mindfulness.
Contemplative Pracitces

Breathing
With our conscious breath, we reunite
our body and mind and arrive in the
present moment.
Just breathing in mindfully already brings
us a surprising amount of freedom.
With each breath, we generate mindful
energy, bringing mind and body together
in the present moment to receive this
caring acknowledgment of our suffering.
In just two or three breaths taken with
your full attention, you may notice that
regret and sorrow about the past have
paused, as well as  uncertainty, fear,
and worries about the future.

Meditation
Meditation is the cultivation of well being
and emotional balance.
Studies report that meditation helps:
- relieve our subjective levels of anxiety and
depression
- improve attention, concentration, and overall
psychological well-being
- increase grey matter volume throughout the
brain
- decreases activity in the default mode network
(DMN), the brain network responsible for mind-
wandering- a.k.a., "monkey mind." Mind-wandering is typically associated with being less
happy
- decr
eases ruminating, and worrying about the
past and future

Guided Meditation for Sacred Space
Visualize yourself in a place that makes you feel calm and relaxed.
It might be a beach, a nature walk, a garden, or the top of a mountain.
Feel the ground, sand, or water beneath your feet as you walk in this space.  Without opening your eyes, look left. What do you notice? Observe it and keep walking.  Look right.  What do you notice?  Observe it and keep walking  Become aware of the colors, the textures, and the distances around you.  What can you hear?  The sounds of birds, water, or air?  Feel the air and wind on your face.  Find a calm, comfortable place to sit down.  Breathe in the calm, balance, ease, stillness, and peace.  Breathe out the stress, pressure, and negativity.  Go to this place whenever you feel you need to relax.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Body Scan
Bring your awareness to your natural breathing pattern.
Breathe in and out.
Bring your awareness to your body.  Become aware of where it touches the ground, a seat, and where it does not.  You may find that your heels touch the ground but your arches don’t. Become aware of all these subtle connections.  Now begin to scan your body.  Bring your awareness to your feet.  Scan your toes, your arches, your ankles, your heels.  Become aware of the different sensations you may feel. You may feel relaxed, or you may feel pain, pressure, tingling, or something totally different.  Become aware of it and then visualize that you are breathing in positive, uplifting, healing energy and breathing out any negative toxic energy.  Now move upward to your legs, calves, shins, and knees.  Again, just scan and observe the sensations. Whenever your mind wanders, gently and softly bring it back to your body.  No force or pressure. No judgment.

Affirmations & Mirror Work
An affirmation is a beginning point. It
opens the way to change.
As a coach:
You are saying to your subconscious
mind, “I am taking responsibility for my
impact. I am aware of the energy I bring
to a session.”
As a coachee:
Mirror work can reveal the cause of an
issue that keeps us from what we want.
Look in the mirror and say: “What do you
need to be okay? What can I be for you
today?” Listen to your inner voice, and
start to form an affirmation that will be the
beginning point of change for you.
(Practice self-compassion to override the
self-critic and respond with a kind, loving
thought).
Ask yourself these two questions!

ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Affirmation Activity
What do you want to bring to your coaching practice right now?
What do you want to offer your client?
Think about it, and then tell your coach/partner,
“I accept for myself__________(whatever it is you desire).
Repeat the affirmation 2 more times and notice the thoughts that come up as you say it. Tell your
partner/coach what comes up for you.
When you say it out loud, you create acute awareness for yourself.
Coach will ask:
•What is blocking you from this affirmation?
•What is moving you toward this affirmation?
•What becomes possible when you embody this affirmation?
Repeat these affirmations in the mirror!

Mantras
Mantras are ways to express love and compassion.
They can be very effective to improve relations with others.
A mantra is a magic formula.
Every time you pronounce a mantra you can transform the situation right away.
Learn mantras so you can recite them when the time is appropriate.
What makes the mantra effective is your mindfulness and concentration.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Compassionate Langauge
There is tremendous power in our spoken words.
The way we talk to ourselves inwardly becomes
the basis of our spoken words. It sets up the
mental atmosphere in which we operate and
which attracts to us our experiences.
