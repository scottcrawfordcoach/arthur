# Patterns Of Unhelpful Thinking
You must first be able to recognise an unhelpful thought before you
challenge it. Being aware of these common unhelpful thought s pattern s can
help you to POLICE them more efficiently.
Here are some examples of typical unhelpful thought patterns:
1) PREDICTING THE FUTURE: When we feel anxious it is common for us to
spend much o f our time thinking about the future and predicting what could go
wrong as supposed to just letting things be . In the end , most o f the predictions
we've made don't actually happen , and we've wasted time and energy being
worried and upset about them.
For example : You predict the future by assuming that you'll perform poorly at a
job interview , or, you assume that someone will reject you before you’ve even
asked them out on a date!
EXERCISE 1: Write down the last time when you have predicted the future in
an unrealistic or an unhelpful way?
NOTE: Some of these thought patterns may sound similar to one another. They are not meant
to be individual categories but will help you to recognise unhelpful patterns in your thinking.

2) MIND READING: This is when we assume that we know what other people are
thinking (usually about us ) without any real evidence to suggest it's true . We can
also make assumptions about why someone said something or behaved in a
certain way and be quick to conclude that it's to do with us.
For example : My boss thinks 'I'm stupid!' Or , 'my work colleague is ignoring me',
but really she just has other things on her mind.
EXERCISE 2: Write down the last time you made an assumption or jumped to a
conclusion about what someone else was thinking without any real evidence
to suggest it was true?
3) CATASTROPHISING: People commonly 'catastrophise' when they're anxious.
This is when we blow things completely out o f proportion and view the situation
as a catastrophe even though the problem is actually quite small.
For example : Assuming someone hates you because they didn’t reply to your
text within 10 seconds . Or, you expect to lose your job because o f a simple
mistake that you’ve made.
EXERCISE 3: Write down the last time that you blew something completely
out of proportion in your mind? How did you feel afterwards?

4) MENTAL FILTERING: When we're anxious, we commonly develop 'tunnel
vision' where we focus solely on the negative aspects o f situations without
considering the positive aspects . Sometimes the whole picture can be coloured
by a single negative detail.
For example : Focusing on the one person who doesn’t like you rather than the
other twenty who do.
EXERCISE 4: When was the last time you focussed more on the negatives than
on the positives? And what would have changed if you hadn't?
5) OVER GENERALISING: Based on one instance in the past or present, you make
the assumption that all others will follow a similar pattern in the future . A sense
of helplessness often accompanies such overgeneralisations.
For example : Just because one ex-partner cheated on you , you believe that ‘ALL
MEN (or Women) ARE BAD!’
EXERCISE 5: How did you feel about yourself (or the world), the last time that
you over-generalised a situation or a group of people?

6) IMAGINING THE WORST CASE SCENARIO: Where we make predictions that
the worst case scenario is going to happen despite the fact that we may have
been successful in this area in the past.
For example : You're asked to give a presentation to a group of people, and you
think 'I'm going to get in there and completely mess this up' even though you've
given many successful presentations in the past.
EXERCISE 6: How did you feel the last time you imagined the worst case
scenario of either a situation or set of circumstances you were facing?
7) LABELLING: When we 'label' ourselves based on our behaviour in specific
situations. We define ourselves by one specific behaviour (usually a negative
behaviour) and fail to consider other positive characteristics and actions.
For example : 'I'm always anxious' even though this is not always the case , or 'I'm
not good enough' because you failed at something , even though there are many
other things that you're good at.
EXERCISE 7: What labels do you currently define yourself by and are they
complimenting your life? If not, which ones do you need to 'ditch'?

8) BLACK OR WHITE THINKING: When things are either 'black-or-white.' We're
either perfect , or we’re a complete failure — and there's no middle ground.
When we place people or situations in 'either/or' categories , where there are no
shades o f grey . This doesn't allow for the complexity o f most people and
situations.
For example: If things are not 'perfect,' then they must be 'horrible.' If your child
is not 'brilliant', then he must be 'stupid.' If you're not 'fascinating', then you must
be 'boring.'
EXERCISE 8: When were you last guilty of 'black or white' thinking? And what
would have changed if your thinking had been more balanced?
9) RIGID RULE KEEPING - 'SHOULDS': When you have a list of ironclad rules
about how you and other people should behave . Those who break the rules
make us angry , and i f you break the rules , you feel guilty as a result . People
often believe they are trying to motivate themselves with shoulds and
shouldn't's , almost as i f they must be punished before they can do anything.
For example: “I must … I should … You must … You should …”. Such statements
provide insight into the standards you tend to uphold and the things you expect
of others and yoursel f. These standards can at times be helpful.
However, they can also create unrealistic expectations that you or other people
will find it difficult to live up to.
EXERCISE 9: Write down the last time that you remember thinking in 'musts
and shoulds' in an unhelpful or unrealistic way?

10) PERSONALISATION: When you believe that everything others say or do is
some sort o f direct , personal reaction to you . Also , when you compare yourself
to other people and try to determine who is smarter , better looking , etc. I f you
think in this way you may see yoursel f as responsible for some unhealthy
external event that you were not actually responsible for at all.
For example : 'We were late to dinner and caused the host to overcook the meal.
If I had just pushed my husband to leave earlier, this wouldn’t have happened.'
EXERCISE 10: When was the last time you personalised something that
another person said or did? What would have changed if you hadn't?
11) EMOTIONAL REASONING: When you believe that what you feel must be true
automatically . If you feel stupid or boring , then you must be stupid or boring.
People who think like this assume that their unhealthy emotions reflect the way
things really are — 'I feel it . Therefore it must be true.'
For example: 'I felt anxious before , during and after my presentation , so it must
have been horrible.”  Notice how the evaluation o f the scenario is based
completely on the emotion rather than the actual delivery of the presentation.
EXERCISE 11: Describe the last time that you believed that what you were
feeling must be true automatically?

12.MINIMISATION: When you have such low self-esteem that you minimise your
own positive characteristics or needs . It’s as i f you are explaining away your own
positive attributes.
For example: If someone speaks down to you in a degrading manner , your
tendency would be to say 'It's OK, don't worry, I deserved it.'
EXERCISE 12: When was the last time you minimized your own personal
attributes because of low self-esteem? How would the situation have been
different if you had been more assertive?
