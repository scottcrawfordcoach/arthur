The Real Diﬀerence A Coach Makes
By Nathalie Blais, 2020
What's so powerful about a coaching conversation? The answer is simple and unique to
coaching. The relationship between coach and client is a partnership of equals. It’s what
ultimately differentiates coaching from other helping professions.
Nearly all other helping professions like therapy, counselling, and mentoring presume the
professional holds the answers to the client’s issue. The helping professional is seen as an advisor
to the client. The client enters the relationship in a “submissive” state. And the professional’s role
is to advise and offer solutions.
Unlocking Genius
A coach partners with the client to clarify thinking and unlock information and potential that already exists within the client. This unique relationship honours the client and begins with the
foundation that Nancy Kline penned so eloquently, "the mind that holds the problem holds the
solution".
The partnering aspect of coaching creates space for new possibilities that are derived by the
client, not the "advisor". The coach’s objectivity is powerful in this relationships as it offers the
opportunity for conscious listening that leads to breakthrough observations and inquiry.
Coaches inspire increased self-esteem, increased resourcefulness, and the client gains the
conﬁdence to trust their intuition the next time they are faced with a problem. Coaching is an
empowering partnership of equals that creates a safe space for the frontal cortex to relax and think clearly, possibly for the ﬁrst time. It’s when we feel safe, heard and like we matter that our
thinking clariﬁes and we begin to see new perspectives and new possibilities. The quality of our
thinking is proportional to the quality of listening.
Self-Management Is The Key
Great coaches practice humility. It's the magic ingredient. There is no room for ego in Coaching, and when the ego makes an appearance, self-management is the key. To go from good to great as
a coach, the most critical skill to hone and practice is learning to be humble.
Being a professional coach means agreeing to hold space for another person. To listen without an agenda. To approach with curiosity and interest in the person's mindset- not the problem. Coaching facilitates the growth of another person by removing self-interest from the equation. Rather than provide answers, assumptions, presumptions and opinions, coaching presumes the person being coached is whole and capable and most importantly, resourceful.As Simon Sinek says, "practice being the last to speak". Self-management means quieting your judgment and checking for meaning rather than making statements. In a society that typically values answers rather than questions, self-management is an art to learn. It implies mind like water, dancing in the moment, and being willing to quiet the voice in your head to make space for the voice across from you.
We need more coaches in the world. So the question is, who will you coach today?
