Goal Setting and the Brain: A Look at NeuroscienceBy  Madhuleena Roy ChowdhuryDecember 2020Goal-setting gives a boost to our Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) which makes us readily act on it (Granot, Stern, and Balcetis, 2017). When the goal is tricky and yet achievable, the SBP gets an enhanced spike that increases our zeal to act and achieve it.Impossible or challenging goals, or the ones that make us question our abilities, are linked with low systolic thrust and they do not provide the spike for ready action. Extensive studies have shown how neural connections and the brain activities pump up our motivation to set and achieve goals.For example, the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) deals with the present orientation of the goal-setting process. The MPFC activation allows us to think about what we need to do right now to achieve our goals, and we set the targets accordingly.
If the goal seems too distant or is too future-oriented, the MPFC activation lowers signiﬁcantly which is why we may lose interest in sticking to the goals or lose the vision of what might be the best ways to achieve them.Usually, goals are the incidents that have not yet happened to us, but we want to make them happen. And since they cannot occur on their own, we follow a set of rules or a plan to ensure achievement. (Balcetis, & Dunning, 2010).The sense of struggle and power testing that involves the goal-setting process is what makes it so engaging to us. For example, a primary drive or intrinsic motivation that forces us to do well on a new or challenging assignment is the ability to demonstrate and validate our skills (McClelland, 1985).The underlying neurochemical changes that cause this motivation to keep burning is therefore vital to understand before we embark on setting the goals. RAS And Goal Setting
Reticular Activating System (RAS) is a part of the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating our goal-setting actions. The RAS is a cluster of cells located at the base of the brain that processes all the information and sensory channels related to the things that need our attention right now.An exciting fact about RAS activation is that it gives us signs. For example, a person whose goal is to start a family, is likely to see more couples and families around him.This happens because of RAS activation. The RAS is aware that this is what the person is paying attention to at this very moment, and hence he chooses to register only the information related to it.Before deciding to start a family, the RAS would naturally have ﬁltered out any such information. The person may have seen so many couples walking past him earlier, but never really paid attention to them, until the time he decided to get married himself. (Alvarez and Emory 2006).The reticular activation functions in two ways when it comes to goal-setting:1. Writing goals
RAS gets activated by the simple act of putting our goals in pen and paper. Seeing our aims written in clear words before us, feeling the touch of the pen, or engaging in the thinking process of writing the targets trigger the RAS functions and ensures that we go for it.2. Planning goalsThe art of imagination is essential when it comes to goal-setting. Studies have shown that people who have the power to visualize their goals before setting their actions have a higher activation at the brain level.Repeatedly imagining success and reminding ourselves of our targets maintains a steady stimulation in the RAS and promotes effective goal-setting (Berkman, Lieberman, 2009).The RAS activation helps in focusing the mind to attend to only those pieces of information that are related to the goals we seek to achieve.Neurologists working on the science of goal-setting have proved that the brain cannot distinguish between reality and imagined reality. So, when we give ourselves a picture of the goal we want to achieve, the mind starts believing it to be real.
Eventually, the brain begins driving us to take actions for making the state and hence, the goal-setting becomes a success.•References•Doran, G. T. (1981). “There’s a S.M.A.R.T.
