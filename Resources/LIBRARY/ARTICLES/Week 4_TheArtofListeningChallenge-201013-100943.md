The Art of Listening
Listening is a foundational skill in coaching. It’s through listening that we form the
deepest connections.
As coaches, we have an obligation and a wonderful opportunity to craft and ﬁne tune our listening skills.
Coaching others requires us to quiet our minds to really hear another person. The challenge is to listen for beliefs, values, attitudes, perspective and choices VS, the
story; in essence it’s to coach the person not the problem.
One way to develop our listening skills is to practice while listening to songs, or
watching  TV,  or listening to podcasts. Pop culture presents many many opportunities
for listening!
Your mission, (if you choose to accept) is to keep a journal to record your reﬂections on
the following 3 challenges:
1.Listen to a podcast. As you listen, write down the words that identify attitudes and
perspective vs the story the person is telling, no matter how much that individual
believes the story to be true.
2.Watch a TV show or movie and track how often you hear the words have to,
should, must, need to, and can’t in the dialogue.
3.Listen to a song and pick out the words that identify the beliefs a song writer holds
about the world or about himself/ herself. How has that belief shaped the story the
song tells?
“Real help, professionally or personally, consists of listening to people, of paying
respectful attention to people so that they can access their own ideas ﬁrst. The quality of your attention determines the quality of other peoples’ thinking.”
-Nancy Kline, author of Time to Think
