Week 8: Clean Language
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

Tune In!

Clean Communication

Remember how conversations work?

ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification

We are deafened by a wall of assumptions and preoccupations
created by what we do or do not pay attention to. It prevents us
from clearly hearing what another person is saying.

Beliefs,
attitudes,
interpretations,
judgements,
assumptions

What is Clean Language?
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

Psychotherapist David Grove developed the Clean
Language Technique in the 1980s, when he realized that
many therapists subtly influence what a client says, or
deems important during sessions.

The objective is for the coach to keep their own thoughts,
assumptions and metaphors out of the conversation by
removing suggestions and interpretations.

Clean Language Approach
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

Clean Language is Simple, Powerful & Respectful

Leaves the person answering the questions free to do their
own thinking about their situation.

Clean Example
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

Use only the words or phrases
that the other person has used.
Replace leading sentiments with
 “that”, “it”, “this”.

Example
Coachee: I’m at a dead end in my career

Coach: Dead end? And what kind of dead end is that?

Coachee: It feels like I’m wandering. Like I’ve lost my way.

Coach: Lost? And what does that feel like?

Coachee: Empty. I need to ﬁnd some feeling of purpose.

Coach: And if you did have feelings of purpose, what would that be like?

Coachee: I'd feel fulﬁlled. I’d be using my strengths

Coach: So, what might those strengths be?

Coachee: I’d be helping people.

Functions of Clean Language
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

Clean questions have 6 core functions:

1.
2.

3.
4.
5.

6.

To acknowledge what the client has said.
To direct the client’s attention to one aspect of their
experience.
To increase self-awareness.
To spot patterns and association in thinking.
To use language that has the greatest impact on the
coachee (their language).
To create a space that is supportive respectful &
attentive.

Circle
of Trust

Activity: Is it clean?

ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification

Coachee: I feel trapped in my job

Coach: So how will you find a way out?

Coachee: I’m in a deep hole and I can’t climb out.

Coach: And what kind of deep hole is that?

Coachee: I feel depressed about my relationship.

Coach: What else is wrong with your relationship?

Coachee: I’m really worried about my partner’s health.

Coach: How can you help them take action on their health?

Coachee: I’m not sure what to do about my current financial situation.

Coach: What is important about that?

Coaching Cleanly

Coach from their beliefs, not yours.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

The aim is to model their representation of self vs your
representation of them.

When modelling as a coach, be aware of the “wall" and
never assume your model is true for them.

Example: If they say “flower”,
and you think “red flower”,
rather than assume the flower
is red, ask “what colour is the
flower?”

Mirroring is stepping into their shoes
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

2.

Mirroring allows the coach to:
1. Distinguish the information that you have actually heard from
what you have imagined, and what you think and feel about
it.
To notice relationships between concepts and to spot gaps
in the information you hear.
To stay objective so that you have the bigger picture and
can choose your questions with that in mind.
To coach with compassion- ‘stepping into the shoes’ of
someone who is having a difﬁcult time and holding space
for them.

Coach the person, not the problem
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

Clean Language
Coachee: "I feel stuck in my department."
Coach: "You feel stuck. And what kind of
stuck is that?”
Coachee: "I work on the same projects
all the time. It's like I don't really matter."
Coach: "And what else can you say
about feeling like you don't matter?"

Coachee: "Well, I used to feel like I was
valued. My boss always asked my
opinion about big projects. But my new
manager never seeks my advice or
sends me challenging assignments. So
I'm just spinning my wheels there."

Unclean Language
Coachee: "I feel stuck in my department."
Coach: "Is your manager hard to work
with? Or are there no opportunities for
you to advance?"
Coachee: "I guess there's little
opportunity for advancement. I'm not
sure. I just feel like I'm stuck there."

The coach added their own ideas to
the conversation before the
coachee could communicate
exactly why they felt stuck. The
coach has led them to the idea that
they have little opportunity to
advance, instead of allowing the
coachee to arrive at this realization
on their own. With a different use of
language, the coachee might have
reached a deeper understanding of
why they felt this way.

How to coach cleanly
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

★Listen attentively. Don’t assuming.

★Refrain from leading in your questions

★Keep your opinions and advice to yourself as much as

possible.

★Ask questions to explore a person's language (echo,

parrot)

★Listen to the answers and then ask more clean questions

about what the other person has said.

Impact of clean coaching
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

By using the Clean Language approach, the coachee has the
space to realize that the reason they felt stuck was because they
no longer felt valued – the root of the problem was the relationship
they had with the new boss- not “development” as the coach
suggested in the unclean example.

As you can see, Clean Language calls for the coach to keep their
thoughts, assumptions and interpretations out of the dialog as
much as possible to allow the coachee to develop and explore
their own feelings and beliefs.

Strategy

Basic Clean Language Questions (Try it!)
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

Topic Questions

★ What does [echo] mean for you? (tidal wave, hole, trap, etc)

★ And what is that like?

★ And that feels like what?

Honing Questions

★ So, what is actually happening?

★ And, what do you want to happen?

★ And what is actually possible?

★ And when you have that, what changes?

Reality Questions

★ Echo. What is that like? [purpose]

★ Echo. Tell me more about that. [fulﬁlled]

★ So that [purpose] is like what then?

★ And what is the relationship between [purpose] and [fulﬁlment]?

★ When [fulﬁlled] is true, what happens to [purpose]?

Clean Strategy
ICF Life & Wellness Coach

★Mingle Clean Language with other questions
★Keep it simple; use little or no syntax
★Use pronouns such as ‘that’ or ‘it’ to replace their words in your

question.

★Use more nodding and eye contact than usual to indicate you are

really listening.

★Add ‘musing’ phrases to your questions such as “I wonder” or “I’m

curious”

Activity: Ask a clean question?

ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification

Coachee: I’m so afraid of being attacked at meetings. Everyone is always so

ready to pounce!

Coachee: I’m really excited about my recent promotion, and I’m concerned it
might be a problem within my circle of friends.

Coachee: I’m feeling discouraged. My role at work seems to be increasingly
preventing me from using my core strengths.

Coachee: I think my marriage is ending. I don’t know if I’m more sad or mad.

Coachee: One of my main objective is to lose weight. I just can’t stand how I feel
anymore.

Coachee: I just got some terrible news. I’m still going about my routine. I don’t
feel anything- although I know I should. It’s as if this is happening to someone
else.

Coachee: I just don’t know how I will manage my work load this year. It’s all so
much to handle.
