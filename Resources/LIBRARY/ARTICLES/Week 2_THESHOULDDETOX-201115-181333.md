The “Should Detox” BY Cana d a Coach Academy
“Should” is a very powerful word. It not only creates excess pressure and guilt , it
allows people to l ive in a f antasy o f wh at “should b e” vs dealing with “what a ctually is”.
It is too e asy for us to stay stuck in dis appointment and n egative self -talk when we are
battling the fantasy of how we think things should be, and avoiding what is.
Language is a powerful place to start to create awareness.
Try this “S hould Detox” to
move
from vic tim to empowered in your day to day language:
# Step
1.
Keep this exercise simple. Think about the last time y ou used the word “should”  in
reference to something you "should have done".
For example, “I should exercise more.”
Now repeat that sentence and wri te it down:
I should exercise more
Pause and observe. How does it feel to say that? Note where that feeling sits in your
body .
STEP 2.
Replace “should” with “could”.
I could  exercise more
How does the “could” sentence feel? What changes? Pause and observe.
STEP 3.  Replace “could” with “can”.

I can exerc ise more.
How does the “c an” sentence feel? What changes? Pause and observe.
STEP 4 .
Replace “can” with “excited to”.
I am excited to  exercise more
How does the “excited to” sentence feel? What changes? Pause and observe.
STEP 5.
Now add a “ so that ” compound to the  sentence to connect with what will be different
when you achieve this.
“I am excited to exerci se more  so that I feel good about  my body,  I feel more
confident and I feel proud  of my commit ment .”
CHALLENGE: NOW YOU TR Y IT!
STEP 1: I should ____________________ more . Pause and observe
STE
P 2: I could ____________________ more . Pause and observe
STEP 3: I can ____________________ more . Pause and observe
STEP 4: I am excited to __________________ __ more. Pause and observe
STEP 5: I am excited to ______________m ore, s o that _______(f eelings  or states)____!
Be sure to write down  how it feels to turn your "shoulds" into "I'm excited" to. Us e

intentions
