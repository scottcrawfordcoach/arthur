Aaron Beck’s Cognitive Triad Positive Psychology, Joaquín Selva, Bc.S., Psychologist October 27, 2019
 According to Beck’s cognitive triad, someone who is pessimistic will automatically have a negative view of themselves, their experiences (that is, the things that the world around them causes to happen to them), and their future. (Beck et al., 1979). Beck says this is because a pessimistic person “tends to perceive his present, his future, and the outside world (the cognitive triad) in a negative way and consequently shows a biased interpretation of his experiences, negative expectancies, and a massive amount of self criticism (Beck et al., 1979). In other words, people who are pessimistic have a negative view of themselves and their lives, and these negative views, creating a cycle of negativity.

50+ Examples of Positive and Negative Automatic Thoughts So, how do automatic thoughts actually present themselves? Since automatic thinking research began with negative thoughts, we’ll start with negative automatic thoughts.  According to the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ-30) developed by Steven Hollon and Philip Kendall in 1980, some examples of negative automatic thoughts include:
  The revised version of the automatic thoughts questionnaire (ATQ-R) (Kendall et al., 1989), which is a measure still used as a basis for automatic thinking research (Koseki et al., 2013), lists the following positive items as additional examples of automatic thoughts (along with the 30 negative thoughts listed above): “I feel like I’m up against the world.”“I’m no good.”“Why can’t I ever succeed?”“No one understands me.”“I’ve let people down.”“I don’t think I can go on.”“I wish I were a better person.”“I’m so weak.”“My life’s not going the way I want it to.”“I’m so disappointed in myself.”“Nothing feels good anymore.”“I can’t stand this anymore.”“I can’t get started.”“What’s wrong with me?”“I wish I were somewhere else.”“I can’t get things together.”“I hate myself.”“I’m worthless.”“Wish I could just disappear.”“What’s the matter with me?”“I’m a loser.”“My life is a mess.”“I’m a failure.”“I’ll never make it.”“I feel so helpless.”“Something has to change.”“There must be something wrong with me.”“My future is bleak.”“It’s just not worth it.”“I can’t ﬁnish anything.”
  According to Rick Ingram and Kathy Wisnicki (1988), some more examples of positive automatic thoughts include:
Cognitive Restructuring of Core Beliefs & Automatic Thoughts Positive automatic thoughts can offset the negative effects of both negative automatic thoughts and stress in general. For example, people with frequent positive automatic thoughts are likely to respond to stress by feeling that their lives are more meaningful, while people with infrequent positive automatic thoughts are likely to respond to stress by feeling that their lives are less meaningful (Boyraz & Lightsey, 2012). “I’m proud of myself.”“I feel ﬁne.”“No matter what happens, I know I’ll make it.”“I can accomplish anything.”“I feel good.”“I’m warm and comfortable.”“I feel conﬁdent I can do anything I set my mind to.”“I feel very happy.”“This is super!”“I’m luckier than most people.”“I am respected by my peers.”“I have a good sense of humor.”“My future looks bright.”“I will be successful.”“I’m fun to be with.”“I am in a great mood.”“There are many people who care about me.”“I’m proud of my accomplishments.”“I will ﬁnish what I start.”“I have many good qualities.”“I am comfortable with life.”“I have a good way with others.”“I am a lucky person.”“I have friends who support me.”“Life is exciting.”“I enjoy a challenge.”“My social life is terriﬁc.”“There’s nothing to worry about.”“I’m so relaxed.”“My life is running smoothly.”“I’m happy with the way I look.”“I take good care of myself.”“I deserve the best in life.”“Bad days are rare.”“I have many useful qualities.”“There is no problem that is hopeless.”“I won’t give up.”“I state my opinions with conﬁdence.”“My life keeps getting better.”“Today I’ve accomplished a lot.”
Furthermore, higher levels of positive automatic thoughts are correlated with higher levels of happiness (Lightsey, 1994). This indicates that in order to have better mental health outcomes, one should reduce their negative automatic negative thoughts and increase their positive automatic thoughts. This is because negative thinking is natural and it’s impossible to completely eliminate it, but outweighing negative thoughts with positive thoughts is possible. One way to do this is with cognitive restructuring (CR), which involves (Hope et al., 2010): •Identiﬁcation of problematic cognitions known as automatic thoughts; •Identiﬁcation of the cognitive distortions in the automatic thoughts; •A rational disputation of automatic thoughts with Socratic dialogue; •Development of a rational rebuttal to the automatic thoughts.   Research in CR with automatic thoughts indicates that effective CR might focus on negative self-evaluative automatic thoughts, especially ones triggered by certain situations. One example could be someone whose automatic thought when faced with an uncomfortable situation is, “I don’t know what to say” (Hope et al., 2010). Focusing on this type of thought is helpful because it can easily be disproved with exposure and role-playing. Another effective CR method when dealing with other-referent automatic thoughts (as opposed to self-referent automatic thoughts) is to minimize the consequences of the negative automatic thoughts. For example, a person could ask herself, “So what if she thinks you are boring?” Aside from CR, research indicates that people with higher levels of dispositional mindfulness are less likely to experience automatic negative thoughts, potentially because they can more easily let go of negative thoughts or direct their attention elsewhere (Frewen et al., 2008).
That study also indicated that a mindfulness intervention derived from both mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was effective at reducing negative thoughts. This indicates that along with positive thinking, mindfulness is another way to counteract negative automatic thinking.
