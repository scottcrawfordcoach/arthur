Mental Balance and Well-Being
Building Bridges Between Buddhism and Western Psychology
B. Alan Wallace Santa Barbara Institute for Consciousness Studies
Shauna L. Shapiro Santa Clara University
Clinical psychology has focused primarily on the diagnosis
and treatment of mental disease, and only recently hasscientiﬁc attention turned to understanding and cultivatingpositive mental health. The Buddhist tradition, on the otherhand, has focused for over 2,500 years on cultivatingexceptional states of mental well-being as well as identify-ing and treating psychological problems. This article at-tempts to draw on centuries of Buddhist experiential andtheoretical inquiry as well as current Western experimentalresearch to highlight speciﬁc themes that are particularlyrelevant to exploring the nature of mental health. Speciﬁ-cally, the authors discuss the nature of mental well-beingand then present an innovative model of how to attain suchwell-being through the cultivation of four types of mentalbalance: conative, attentional, cognitive, and affective.

Particularly since World War II, clinical psychology
has focused primarily on the diagnosis and treat-ment of mental disease, and only recently has
scientiﬁc attention turned to understanding and cultivatingpositive mental health (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi,2000). The Buddhist tradition, on the other hand, hasconcerned itself over the past 2,500 years with cultivatingexceptional states of mental well-being as well as identi-fying and treating problems of the mind (Smith, 1991).
Toward a Dialogue
Although the records of the Buddha’s discourses and latercommentarial literature within the Buddhist tradition do notelaborate on the theme of “mental health” as such, they dodiscuss the nature and causes of mental imbalances andtechniques for achieving mental well-being. This articledraws on centuries of Buddhist experiential and theoreticalinquiry to show how a dialogue with Western psychologycan be mutually enriching and particularly relevant to cur-rent psychological interest in exploring the nature of pos-itive mental health.
This article speciﬁcally focuses on Buddhism, because
it is widely considered the most psychological of all spir-itual traditions (Smith, 1991). Buddhism is fundamentallyconcerned with identifying the inner causes of human suf-fering, the possibility of freedom from suffering, and themeans to realize such freedom. Unlike many religions, itdoes not begin with arousing faith in a supernatural beingbut rather with investigating the nature of human experi-
ence (Wallace, 1999, 2003). Buddhism presents a world-view that is thoroughly integrated with a discipline ofexperiential inquiry into the nature of the mind and relatedphenomena, and it includes empirical, analytical, and reli-gious elements (Segall, 2003). Thus, it can be relevant tophilosophical and psychological theory and practice be-cause of its intensive exploration of the mind and itspsychological methods to cultivate sustained well-being.
To help open up collaborative dialogue between Bud-
dhism and Western psychology, this article introduces afourfold model of well-being, drawing from Buddhistteachings as well as Western psychology and research. Webegin by introducing a deﬁnition of well-being, derivedfrom core insights of the Buddha as well as current Westernpsychological theory and research. We then describe aninnovative model of how to cultivate mental well-being,focusing on four types of mental balance: conative, atten-tional, cognitive, and affective. The model draws on tradi-tional Buddhist theory as well as relevant Western psycho-logical research to demonstrate how dialogue and empiricalstudy can enrich both traditions.
Nature and Types of Buddhism
Although the Buddhist tradition stems from the teachingsattributed to the historical Buddha, over the past 2,500years it has become assimilated with a wide range ofcultures throughout Asia, resulting in an equally widerange of sacred writings, theories, and practices. Broadlyspeaking, Buddhism is commonly classiﬁed in terms ofSoutheast Asian Theravada Buddhism, East Asian Mahay-ana Buddhism, and Indo-Tibetan Mahayana and VajrayanaBuddhism, each having its own unique characteristics and

emphases. But there is also great internal diversity within
each of these large traditions, and Buddhism continues toevolve today, not only throughout Asia but worldwide(Harvey, 1990; Mitchell, 2002).
Among the many schools of Buddhism that have
developed over its long history, in this article we relyprimarily on the rich literature of the Theravada Buddhismof Southeast Asia and Mahayana Buddhism as they origi-nated in India and later evolved in Tibet. All schools ofBuddhism are concerned with the realization of spiritualliberation and enlightenment, but these two traditions havedeveloped an especially rich body of theories and practicesfor achieving the more modest goal of mental well-being(Aronson, 2004). For this reason, the majority of the teach-ings we draw from in our attempt to develop a model ofmental health and balance are from the Theravada andMahayana literature. And yet, it is important to note that allschools of Buddhism share in common with Western psy-chology the fundamental goal of reducing suffering (Bodhi,2005).
Well-Being and Its Facsimiles
The goal of Buddhist practice is the realization of a state ofwell-being that is not contingent on the presence of plea-surable stimuli, either external or internal (Wallace, 1999).According to Buddhism, this movement toward well-beingis a fundamental part of being human. As the Dalai Lamacommented,
I believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness.
Whether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes inthis religion or that religion, we all are seeking something betterin life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards happi-ness. (Dalai Lama & Cutler, 1998, p. 15)A fundamental insight of Buddhism is the recognition
of the ﬂuctuating, impermanent nature of all phenomenathat arise in dependence on preceding causes and contrib-uting conditions (N ˜anamoli & Bodhi, 1995). Mistakenly
grasping objective things and events as true sources ofhappiness produces a wide range of psychological prob-lems, at the root of which is the reiﬁcation of oneself as animmutable, unitary, independent ego (Ricard, 2006). Byﬁrst recognizing these ways of misapprehending oneselfand the rest of the world, one can then begin to identify theactual sources of genuine well-being (Wallace, 2005b;Wallace & Hodel, 2006). The true causes of such well-being are rooted in a wholesome way of life, are nurturedthrough the cultivation of mental balance, and come tofruition in the experience of wisdom and compassion. Inthis way, the pursuits of genuine well-being, understand-ing, and virtue come to be thoroughly integrated.
Buddhism promotes an ideal state of well-being that
results from freeing the mind of its afﬂictive tendencies andobscurations and from realizing one’s fullest potential interms of wisdom, compassion, and creativity (Wallace, inpress). In this article, the well-being we are referring to isfundamentally different from hedonic well-being, whichincludes stimulus-driven pleasures of all kinds (Bodhi,2005, pp. 199–205; Wallace, 1993, pp. 1–10). Accordingto Buddhist teaching, people may derive enjoyment fromsensual pleasures, such as attractive visual images, sounds,aromas, tastes, and tactile sensations, but as soon as theylose touch with these stimuli, the resultant pleasure fades(Tsong-kha-pa, 2002). Buddhism suggests that the same istrue of the satisfaction people may experience as a result ofbeing praised, acknowledged, respected, and loved. Theacquisition of material goods, ﬁnancial security, power,and fame may lead to happiness, but it too is transient. All
such pleasures are contingent on stimuli, either from theenvironment, from interactions with other people, or fromvarious kinds of physical and mental activity. But whenthose stimuli cease, the associated pleasure wanes (Ricard,2006).
This ancient Buddhist critique of stimulus-driven
pleasure has been indirectly supported by current researchﬁnding that wealth does not predict lasting happiness (Die-ner, Sandvik, Seidlitz, & Diener, 1993; Inglehart, 1990).

For example, even lottery winners gain only a temporaryboost in reported subjective well-being and then return tobaseline (Argyle, 1986; Brickman, Coates, & Janoff-Bul-man, 1978). In fact, Myers and Diener (1995), after yearsof research on psychological happiness, concluded that“satisfaction is less a matter of getting what you want thanwanting what you have” (p.13), a statement in accordancewith the Buddhist emphasis on the importance of content-ment (Tsong-kha-pa, 2002, p. 29).
Moreover, according to Buddhist theory, clinging to
such stimuli as the actual source of one’s happiness can
1These ﬁndings are nuanced, and we do not want to overstate the
relationship between money and happiness (see Lucas & Dyrenforth,2006, for a critique).

easily give rise to at least intermittent, if not chronic,
anxiety as one faces the possibility, likelihood, or certaintythat stimuli will not last (Tsong-kha-pa, 2000, pp. 281–284). According to one Buddhist adage, as people cling tothese objects, situations, and activities as the source ofhappiness, there can eventually be only two outcomes:Either the objects, situations, and activities disappear, orpeople disappear. A common misconception is that Bud-dhism uniformly denies the value of stimulus-driven plea-sures, as if it were morally wrong to enjoy the simplepleasures of life, let alone the joys of raising a family,creating ﬁne works of art, or making scientiﬁc discoveries.All of these have their own merits, but a life that isconcerned with such pursuits alone does not give rise tolasting well-being.
This is not a matter of choosing well-being instead of
hedonic pleasures, some of which, like the joys of friend-ship and worthwhile accomplishments, may be very mean-ingful. The enjoyment of such transient experiences is notin opposition to the cultivation of positive attitudes andcommitments or the cultivation of the types of mentalbalance that yield inner well-being. In fact, one may derivegreater enjoyment from hedonic pleasures as a result ofcultivating well-being. What is important is not to conﬂatethe two and mistakenly believe that external pleasures willbring lasting happiness.
One can distinguish between well-being and its
facsimiles by imagining all of the external supports forhis or her present sense of happiness and security sud-denly disappearing. Whatever sense of well-being thatremains is authentic. All of one’s happiness that hasvanished is merely on loan, contingent on transient con-ditions that are largely out of one’s control. People canignore that fact and lead their lives with a false sense ofsecurity, or they may wake up to the illusory nature of
much of their happiness and seek to cultivate genuinewell-being through the development of mental balance,which is not dependent on pleasurable sensory, aes-thetic, or intellectual stimuli.
Support From Western Psychology
Well-being that transcends such transient, stimulus-drivenpleasures depends on the cultivation of speciﬁc types ofenduring beliefs and attitudes and on developing one’ssignature strengths (Haidt, 2006; Seligman, 2004). Thecultivation of meaningful priorities, attitudes, perspectives,and behaviors has been highlighted by positive psychology(Seligman, 1998) and is also strongly emphasized in Bud-dhist practice (Shantideva, 1997; Wallace, 2001a). BothWestern psychology and Buddhism claim that the happi-ness resulting from such internal mental training is moredurable than stimulus-driven pleasures (Brickman & Cam-bell, 1971; Ryan & Deci, 2001).
Current psychological research on “maximizers” and
“satisﬁcers” supports this theory of well-being drawn fromBuddhism and Western psychology (Schwartz et al., 2002).Maximizers are deﬁned as persons who are always looking
for the best, whereas satisﬁcers are satisﬁed once the
threshold of acceptability based on their intrinsic values iscrossed. Research demonstrates that maximizers’ attemptsat ﬁnding the best paradoxically leads to increased suffer-ing, not increased satisfaction. Of note, although maximiz-ers may achieve better objective outcomes than satisﬁcers,they are likely to experience these outcomes as worse(Iyengar, Wells, & Schwartz, 2006). As the maximizerattempts to create an internal state through external perfec-tion, dissatisfaction (not pleasure) increases. This rein-forces a core hypothesis of Buddhism that expectations andstriving after such things as wealth, fame, approval, andpower lead to discontentment, anxiety, and frustration.
Buddhism states that these misguided attempts to ﬁnd
happiness are due to people’s confusion about the sourcesthat lead to true well-being (N ˜anamoli & Bodhi, 1995;
Goldstein & Kornﬁeld, 1987). This view is supported bycurrent psychological research in affective forecasting.Kahneman, Diener, and Schwarz (1999) proposed that peo-ple are poor predictors of their future happiness, ﬁndingthat people often inaccurately forecast the emotional im-pact of speciﬁc events and therefore make choices based onerroneous calculations of what will bring the greatest hap-piness (Kahneman et al., 1999). There is substantial evi-dence for an impact bias in predictions about emotionalreactions to future events (for a review, see Wilson &Gilbert, 2003). These ﬁndings lend partial support to theBuddhist view that often what people think will make themhappy does not lead to lasting well-being.
Current psychological research also offers preliminary
conﬁrmation of the Buddhist teaching that the level ofone’s happiness is not ﬁxed but can be consciously culti-vated. Until recently, psychological theory posited that the“set point” for experiencing happiness is ﬁxed by temper-ament and early life experience and is difﬁcult to shift(Kahneman et al., 1999). However, recent research in neu-

roscience is beginning to show support for the Buddha’s
theory. For example, Davidson and colleagues (2003)found that novice meditation practice was associated withsigniﬁcantly greater activity in the left prefrontal cortex, anarea of the brain associated with positive emotion. Thisﬁnding was further supported by a prospective randomizedcontrolled trial examining the effects of mindfulness med-itation on brain activity as well as psychological and im-munological functioning (Davidson et al., 2003).

As the above discussion illustrates, the quest for well-
being is often difﬁcult and misguided. Below we present aheuristic model that proposes that well-being arises from amind that is balanced in four ways: conatively, attention-ally, cognitively, and affectively. This fourfold model ofmental balance draws from both Buddhism and Westernpsychology in an attempt to build a bridge between thesetwo rich traditions. Our model of mental balance is notfound in traditional Buddhist literature, which does notgenerally discuss mental health as a topic distinct fromteachings on the path to enlightenment. Nevertheless, thisnovel approach to understanding and developing excep-tional levels of mental balance is derived from sources invarious Buddhist texts that explain how to train the mind inways that alleviate suffering from its source (Buddhaghosa,1979; Shantideva, 1997; Tsong-kha-pa, 2000, 2002).
Cultivating Mental Balance
One of the fundamental Buddhist premises that underliesthis presentation of well-being is that mental suffering isdue in large part to imbalances of the mind (Gunaratana,1985, pp. 28–48; Tsong-kha-pa, 2000, pp. 297–313). Forexample, anxiety, frustration, and depression are consid-ered to be symptoms of an unbalanced mind. On the otherhand, just as a healthy, uninjured body is relatively free ofpain, so is a healthy, balanced mind relatively free ofpsychological distress, even in the face of adversity. Al-though mental suffering is often catalyzed by environmen-tal and social inﬂuences and it presumably always hasneural correlates (Ryff & Singer, 1998), such suffering canoften be traced to subjectively experienced mental imbal-ances. Buddhism suggests that many of them can be rem-edied through skillful, sustained mental training (Tsong-kha-pa, 2000).
The basic theory is that to the extent that the mind’s
habitual “ground state,” prior to any sensory or conceptualstimulation, is in a state of imbalance, it is characterized bydissatisfaction (Tsong-kha-pa, 2000, pp. 290–292). On thebasis of this theory, we have developed a heuristic model offour kinds of mental balance: conative, attentional, cogni-tive, and affective. The four components of the model werechosen because we believe they encapsulate the majorprocesses involved in training the mind to achieve excep-tional levels of health and well-being.
The model is presented in a linear fashion, beginning
with conative balance. Conative balance precedes the otherthree in the process of cultivating mental well-being, be-cause this factor is what allows people to set intentions,goals, and priorities. In effect, conative processes set thecourse for the cultivation of the other three mental bal-ances. Attentional balance is the next mental factor dis-
cussed, because attention is a necessary skill for achievingthe ﬁnal two factors, cognitive and affective balance. With-out the ability to sustain attention, it is difﬁcult to closelyexamine people’s moment-to-moment cognitive and affec-tive processes. Cognitive and affective balance are pre-sented subsequently, as they can most effectively beachieved on the basis of the prior cultivation of conativeand attentional balance.
Although we present the model in a linear procession,
we are not suggesting any kind of strict linearity amongthese four elements of mental balance. All components ofthe model are interconnected. The model represents a sys-temic and dynamic process of evolving toward well-being.Each factor of the model has its own distinct qualities,while it is simultaneously part of the larger whole of thesystem. This aspect of the model is akin to the term holon
(Koestler, 1978), which refers to a system that is both awhole composed of parts and a part composing largerwholes. Therefore, although we describe each of the mentalbalances below as individual factors, it is important to notethat as balance is gained in one area, it affects the otherthree. For example, as one gains greater affective balance,this is likely to result in greater wisdom regarding one’schoice of goals (conative balance), increased ability tosustain attention (attentional balance), and clearer mindful-ness of events as they arise from moment to moment(cognitive balance).
Below we describe each of the four mental balances.
In an attempt to precisely operationalize them, we use asystem of classiﬁcation drawn from traditional Tibetanmedicine, which deﬁnes physiological imbalances in termsof deﬁcit, hyperactivity, and dysfunction. This system ofclassiﬁcation is closely linked to Indo-Tibetan Buddhism(Dhonden, 1986, 2000). We attempt to show how each ofthe mental balances has its own distinct characteristics,though all four are interdependent. In addition, we citerelevant Western psychological theory and research to helpsupport our discussion. Finally, we suggest empirical ques-tions that arise out of our fourfold model.
Conative Balance
The term conation refers to the faculties of intention and
volition. For example, the intention to spend more timewith one’s children and the intent to lose weight are bothcases of conation, with intention, or a goal, implying astronger commitment to action than desire alone. An illus-tration of a desire, as distinct from an intention, is theyearning to stop smoking, which is not fortiﬁed by theactual resolve to do so. Conative balance is the ﬁrst of the
2Results indicated that the meditation group demonstrated signiﬁ-
cantly increased left to right prefrontal activity. Further, this shift inprefrontal activity was correlated with subjective reports of well-being aswell as enhanced immune functioning. The results of these studies are notconclusive, however, as the same level of left prefrontal cortex activitywas exhibited by two subjects with no meditative training. Nevertheless,these ﬁndings do support the emerging ﬁeld of neuroplasticity, whichstates that many neural processes are malleable and can change in re-sponse to experience.

mental states discussed because of its central importance to
all other mental states. If one does not develop conativebalance—a reality-based range of desires and aspirationsoriented toward one’s own and others’ happiness—thenthere will be little or no incentive to try to balance one’sattentional, cognitive, and affective faculties. A commonmisconception of Buddhism is that it promotes the ideal ofhaving no desires or goals whatsoever. But this wouldimply a vegetative state utterly at variance with the Bud-dhist ideal of genuine well-being (Asanga, 2001, p. 16;Gethin, 2001, pp. 90–91). Although Buddhism does ex-plain how the suffering may be caused by unwholesomegoals and desires, it also emphasizes the value of whole-some goals and desires, such as the intention to be aconscientious and loving parent or to contribute to a sus-tainable ecosphere (Tsong-kha-pa, 2004). In this context,the terms wholesome andunwholesome refer to those forms
of physical, verbal, and mental behavior that are, respec-tively, conducive to and detrimental to one’s own andothers’ well-being. To determine what is wholesome andunwholesome requires a careful examination of the long-term consequences of behavior, for an unwholesome actmay lead to short-term gratiﬁcation but long-term misery,whereas a wholesome deed may be fraught with difﬁcultiesin the short term but lead to deeply rewarding conse-quences as time passes.
On the basis of this teaching, in our model, conative
balance entails intentions and volitions that are conduciveto one’s own and others’ well-being. Conative imbalances,on the other hand, constitute ways in which people’s de-sires and intentions lead them away from psychologicalﬂourishing and into psychological distress (Rinpoche,2003; Wallace, 1993, pp. 31–43).
A conative deﬁcit occurs when people experience an
apathetic loss of motivation for happiness and its causes(Rabten, 1992, p. 86; Vasubandhu, 1991, p. 193). This isnormally accompanied by a lack of imagination or a kind ofstagnated complacency: People cannot imagine faring bet-ter than they are now, so in this state of despair, they do nottry to do anything to achieve such well-being. Some peoplefall into such apathy due to disappointment, when theyhave failed to reach a goal or fulﬁll an aspiration, such asbeing accepted at a chosen college or landing a promisingjob. Conative hyperactivity is present when people ﬁxateon obsessive goals that obscure the reality of the present(Asanga, 2001, pp. 15–18; Rabten, 1992, pp. 84–85).People are so caught up in craving and fantasies about thefuture—about their unfulﬁlled desires—that their sensesare dulled as to what is happening here and now. In theprocess, people may also blind themselves to the needs andaspirations of others. Students, for example, may be soobsessed with achieving optimal grades that they becomeoverwrought with anxiety and fail to prepare properly fortheir exams. Likewise, a man may become so intent onwinning a woman’s affections that his attentions to thewoman of his desire become oppressive. By being socaught up in desire, the man fails to notice that he is
alienating the very woman he is trying to impress.Finally, conative dysfunction sets in when people de-
sire things that are detrimental to their own or others’well-being and are indifferent to things that do contribute totheir own and others’ well-being (Gunaratana, 1985, p. 29).For example, if one becomes obsessed with the pursuit offame and ﬁnancial success, this single-minded ﬁxation mayprove detrimental to one’s physical and psychologicalhealth while also damaging one’s personal relations withfriends, loved ones, and professional colleagues. Addictionand other forms of substance abuse, which may yieldshort-term pleasure and relief from pain, are other expres-sions of conative dysfunction.
It is crucial to recognize that individual psychological
ﬂourishing is not something that can be cultivated whileignoring the well-being of others. People do not existindependently from others, so their well-being cannot ariseindependently of others either. The seventh-century IndianBuddhist contemplative Shantideva (1997) commented onconative dysfunction in this way: “Those seeking to escapefrom suffering hasten right toward their own misery. Andwith the very desire for happiness, out of delusion theydestroy their own well-being as if it were their enemy”(p. 21).
Conative balance does not imply that one simply
changes goals, substituting one for another. There are ac-tually scores of different Buddhist practices to cultivateright intention or right motivation, which pertain directly toconative balance (Tsong-kha-pa, 2000, 2004). These in-clude reﬂection on meaningful and wholesome desires andrecognizing unwholesome desires that will lead to sufferingboth for oneself and others. The reﬂection is carried further,focusing not only on the desire and goal itself but also onthe cause and effect of speciﬁc desires. For example, “If Icontinue on this track and I try to fulﬁll this desire, what arethe consequences for my own and others’ well-being?” Insuch ways, the right intention implies an altruistic devotionto meaningful desires that are conducive not only to one’sown well-being but to the ﬂourishing of others as well.
General Buddhist approaches to attaining conative
balance are (a) to remedy apathy by meditating on therealities of impermanence and suffering and the possibilityof generating well-being by reﬂecting, for example, on thelives of those who have realized such fulﬁllment, (b) toremedy obsessive desire with the cultivation of content-ment, and (c) to remedy mistaken goals with the experien-tial recognition of the true causes of both suffering andwell-being (Wallace, 2001b, pp. 218–222). Buddhism pre-sents a wide array of meditations designed to remedyspeciﬁc forms of craving and other obsessive desires and topromote wholesome aspirations (Shantideva, 1981, pp.142–156, 188–215). Contentment is cultivated by reﬂect-ing on the transitory, unsatisfying nature of hedonic plea-sures and by identifying and developing the inner causes ofgenuine well-being. At the same time, by reﬂecting on thepotential beneﬁts of achieving exceptional states of mentalbalance and insight, one may experience a healthy sense ofdiscontent regarding one’s current degree of psychologicaland spiritual maturation, leading to an insatiable aspirationto explore the frontiers of one’s inner development. The

result of such conative balance is a decrease in interest in
achieving an excess of such things as sensual pleasures,material acquisitions, and social status and a growing com-mitment to leading a meaningful and deeply satisfying life,qualiﬁed by a growing sense of well-being, understanding,and virtue.
According to Buddhism, although the primary sources
of mental suffering are internal mental afﬂictions such ascraving, hostility, and delusion, it is common for people tomistakenly identify external objects, people, and situationsas the true sources of their misery, anxiety, and frustration.Craving , as it is deﬁned in Buddhism, is an attraction for an
object on which one conceptually superimposes or exag-gerates desirable qualities while ﬁltering out undesirablequalities (Wallace, 1999). In cases of strong craving andafﬂictive attachment (including addiction), one transfersthe very possibility of one’s own happiness onto the objecton which one’s mind is bent, thereby disempowering one-self and empowering the object of one’s desire (Rabten,1992, pp. 74–75).
Support from Western psychology. Cur-
rent psychological research supports the importance ofhaving clear and unconﬂicting aspirations and goals thatare inherent in attaining conative balance. For example,Emmons (1986) found that having goals, making progresstoward goals, and having goals that did not conﬂict witheach other were all predictors of subjective well-being andhappiness. In addition, the Buddhist idea of right motiva-tion has implicitly found its way into Western psycholog-ical theory in the stages of change model of addictivebehavior developed by Prochaska, DiClemente, andNorcross (1992). Clients often move through these stagesdepending on their motivational level. Research has foundthat therapists and interventions matched to a person’sconative–motivational level are highly effective(Prochaska et al., 1992). The attention to motivation inWestern psychology has increased signiﬁcantly over thepast decade because of the work of W. Miller and Rolnick(1991) and their development of motivational interviewing,an efﬁcacious approach geared toward enhancing clients’motivation to change.
Empirical questions. Buddhist teachings posit
that conation is essential to mental well-being (Byrom,1991). This is an interesting empirical question. The modelthat we have developed follows this assumption. We positthat the other three mental balances will not lead to well-being without the development of conative balance. Ourmodel suggests that the faculty of attention in and of itselfdoes not necessarily lead to well-being. A sniper, for in-stance, may develop highly concentrated, unwavering at-tention without such attention skills’ leading to well-being.Our model supports the previous theory that the intentionbehind the attention is elemental (see S. L. Shapiro &Schwartz, 2000, for a review). Rigorous research examin-ing the question of the role of conative balance in theproposed model of mental balance might ask, for example,whether the cultivation of attentional or cognitive balanceresults in equal well-being if conative balance is notpresent. For example, an individual with exceptional atten-tional balance may be able to sustain attention for pro-
longed periods of time on examining trends in the stockmarket. But if he or she does not have conative balance, heor she may be consumed by greed and fear and will notexperience subjective well-being (e.g., quality of life, senseof happiness, low stress) or objective well-being (e.g.,healthy blood pressure and immune proﬁles).
Attentional Balance
Attentional balance, including the development of sus-
tained, voluntary attention, is a crucial feature of mentalhealth and optimal performance in any kind of meaningfulactivity. According to Buddhist teachings, it is achieved byovercoming attentional deﬁcit, hyperactivity, and dysfunc-tion, to which human beings at large, and not just thosediagnosed with attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, areprone (Gunaratana, 1985, pp. 28–32). From a Buddhistperspective, an attentional deﬁcit is characterized by theinability to focus vividly on a chosen object. Students in aclassroom, for example, may have a hard time attending totheir teacher’s instructions because of falling into listless-ness, boredom, or dullness. Attentional hyperactivity oc-curs when the mind is excessively aroused, resulting incompulsive distraction and agitation. To return to the ex-ample of a classroom situation, students may be inattentiveto their teacher because they are caught up in their owndaydreaming, restlessness, and other distractions. Attentionis dysfunctional when people focus on things in afﬂictiveways, those that are not conducive to their own or others’well-being.
An attentional deﬁcit corresponds closely to the Bud-
dhist concept of laxity, and attentional hyperactivity corre-lates with excitation (Lamrimpa, 1995; Wallace, 1999,2005a, 2006a). These imbalances are remedied through thecultivation of mindfulness , which is deﬁned in many Bud-
dhist texts as sustained, voluntary attention continuouslyfocused on a familiar object, without forgetfulness or dis-traction (Asanga, 2001, p. 9; Buddhaghosa, 1979, p. 524;Gethin, 2001, pp. 36–44), and meta-attention , the ability to
monitor the state of the mind, swiftly recognizing whetherone’s attention has succumbed to either excitation or laxity(N˜anamoli & Bodhi, 1995, p. 975). Shantideva (1997)
emphasized the importance of developing attentional skillsfor psychological ﬂourishing when he wrote, “Upon devel-oping zeal in that way, one should stabilize the mind inmeditative concentration, since a person whose mind isdistracted lives between the fangs of mental afﬂictions”(p. 89).
One of the most widespread Buddhist practices for
developing attentional balance is mindfulness of breathing.In such practice, one may begin by focusing the attentionon the tactile sensations of the respiration wherever theyarise in the entire body; one may then more narrowly focuson the sensations of the rise and fall of the abdomen witheach in- and out-breath; and in the most highly focusedexercise, the attention may be directed to the sensations ofthe passage of the breath at the apertures of the nostrils.While the attention is mindfully engaged with the respira-tion, one meta-cognitively monitors the meditative process,

noting as swiftly as possible the occurrence of either laxity
or excitation. When laxity sets in, the primary remedy is toarouse the attention by taking a fresh interest in the objectof meditation, whereas when the mind becomes agitated,the ﬁrst thing to do is to relax more deeply. In this way, theattentional imbalances of laxity and excitation may beovercome (Wallace, 2006a).
Support from Western psychology. Cur-
rent psychological theory corroborates the Buddha’s teach-ings on the signiﬁcance of attention. For example, severaltheories of self-regulation discuss the central place of at-tention in the maintenance and enhancement of psycholog-ical functioning (Ryan & Deci, 2001; S. L. Shapiro &Schwartz, 2000; Teasdale et al., 2000). In addition, thework of Cohen and Blum (2002) posits the central role ofattention and cognitive control in guiding thought, behav-ior, and decision making.
The psychological theory of ﬂow, developed by Csik-
szentmihalyi (1990), also conﬁrms the importance of sus-tained attention. Flow is deﬁned as the state of being
completely involved in an activity for its own sake. Re-search based on the theoretical concept of ﬂow demon-strates that happiness comes from deep attention and en-gagement in activity (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).
One of the most intriguing aspects of Buddhist atten-
tional training has to do with the development of thesimultaneous qualities of relaxation, attentional stability,and vividness. In the course of such meditative practice,one experiences a growing sense of physical and mentalease, yet at the same time, the coherence and vividness ofattention increase (Wallace, 2006a, pp. 13–22, 155–162).This physical and mental ease is akin to the “relaxationresponse” and has been posited by many Western psychol-ogists as the mechanism by which meditation affects men-tal and physical health (Benson, 1984). However, whereasrelaxation plays an important role in effecting change, thestability and vividness of attention may also be key ele-ments. This Buddhist assertion can be tested using Westernpsychological methodology.
On the basis of many studies of attention in healthy
individuals—including those with skills in areas such as airtrafﬁc control, music, mathematics, and chess—psycholo-gists have generally found that attentional arousal is cor-related with effort. When one is deeply relaxed, there is alow level of attentional vividness, and when attention ishighly aroused, this is correlated with a high degree ofeffort (Critchley & Mathias, 2003).
In Buddhist attentional practice, on the contrary, one
ﬁrst emphasizes the cultivation of mental and physicalrelaxation; on that basis, attentional stability is highlighted,and ﬁnally one focuses on the development of attentionalvividness. The result of such training is an anomalous stateof attentional balance in which a high level of attentionalarousal is maintained while remaining deeply relaxed andcomposed. For this reason, it is called meditative quies-
cence (shamatha ). The mind is now free of both attentional
laxity (deﬁcit) and excitation (hyperactivity), and it can beused effectively for any task to which it is put (Wallace,2006a, pp. 167–173).Empirical questions. One empirical question
this aspect of attentional balance poses is, Which theory iscorrect? Is focused attention opposed to relaxation or isrelaxation a fundamental prerequisite to states of focusedattention that can be maintained for long periods withoutexhaustion? If the latter were conﬁrmed by research, itwould have far-reaching implications for training in anyactivity, including in academic, scientiﬁc, aesthetic, ath-letic, and spiritual pursuits.
Two empirical questions that arise around attention
are, What is an “optimal” level of attention? and What arethe disadvantages of attentional imbalances? According toBuddhism, attention can and should be trained. Withoutthis mental training, the human mind remains in what hasbeen referred to as an “arrested state of development” or asJames (1911/1924) stated, “Compared to what we ought tobe, we are only half awake” (p. 237).
Psychological research (Simons & Chabris, 1999) is
demonstrating the effects of cognitive blindness andchange blindness, that is, not detecting large changes inobjects and scenes, which result from the limited capacityof people’s untrained attentional abilities. This researchsuggests that people perceive and remember only thoseobjects and details that receive focused attention (Simons& Chabris, 1999). Simons and Chabris (1999) concludedthat people are “surprisingly unaware of the details of[their] environment” and “do not detect large changes” (p.1059) because of lack of attention. Another empirical ques-tion therefore is, Does meditative training in attentionresult in signiﬁcantly less change blindness?
Cognitive Balance
Cognitive balance entails engaging with the world of ex-
perience without imposing conceptual assumptions or ideason events and thereby misapprehending or distorting them.It therefore involves being calmly and clearly present withexperience as it arises moment by moment. We use theterm cognitive in the sense of knowing as opposed to purely
discursive thought (Wallace, 2005a).
According to Buddhism, the distinguishing character-
istic of what we are referring to as cognitive balance is thatone views the world without the imbalances of cognitivehyperactivity, deﬁcit, or dysfunction (King, 1992, pp. 82–102; Gunaratana, 1985, pp. 143–174; Lamrimpa, 2002).People with severe cognitive imbalances are radically outof touch with reality and are commonly diagnosed withsome form of psychosis. Yet in the Buddhist view, healthypeople too are generally prone to cognitive imbalances ofall three kinds. At times, people are simply absent-minded(cognitive deﬁcit); on other occasions, they get caught upin their assumptions and expectations, failing to distinguishbetween perceived realities and their fantasies (cognitivehyperactivity); and they are generally prone to misappre-hending events (cognitive dysfunction) in a myriad of waysdue to cognitive deﬁcit and hyperactivity imbalances(Rabten, 1992). A commonly cited example in Buddhism ismistaking a coiled rope for a snake. Because one does notinitially perceive this object clearly (cognitive deﬁcit), oneis prone to projecting one’s fears or expectations on the

object (cognitive hyperactivity), resulting in a misidentiﬁ-
cation of the object (cognitive dysfunction). In similarways, people may mistake the emotions, attitudes, andintentions of other people because of a failure of clearattention, compounded by unconscious projections of theirown hopes and fears.
Overcoming such cognitive imbalances is a central
theme in Buddhist practice, where one of the primaryinterventions is the application of discerning mindfulnessto whatever arises from moment to moment. The faculty ofmindfulness, as previously deﬁned, is initially cultivated asa means to overcome attentional imbalances, and it is thenapplied to daily experience in order to achieve cognitivebalance (Gunaratana, 1991). The ﬁrst challenge in theBuddhist cultivation of cognitive balance is to learn how toattend just to what is being presented to one’s senses and todevelop an inner awareness of one’s own mental processes.As the Buddha said, “In the seen there is only the seen; inthe heard, there is only the heard; in the sensed, there isonly the sensed; in the known, there is only the known”(Udana 8, as cited in Analayo, 2006, p. 233). The four
applications of mindfulness to (a) the body, (b) feelings, (c)mental states and processes, and (d) phenomena in generalconstitute the most fundamental system of meditative prac-tice in Buddhism for achieving insight by means of over-coming cognitive imbalances. In the prior development ofattentional balance, one cultivates the faculty of sustained,vivid attention; then to overcome cognitive imbalances,one applies those attention skills to the careful examinationof one’s own and others’ physical and mental presence andto all kinds of causal interactions. By means of such closeattentiveness to one’s interactive presence with other peo-ple and the environment at large, problems of cognitivedeﬁcit are overcome, and by carefully observing what isperceptually presented to one’s senses, one learns to dis-tinguish between the contents of perception and the con-ceptual superimpositions that one projects on one’s imme-diate experience of the world (Thera, 1973).
Support from Western psychology. There
is a rapidly growing body of scientiﬁc research exploringthe therapeutic effects of such mindfulness
3training (Baer,
2003), including mindfulness-based stress reduction (Ka-bat-Zinn, 1990) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy(Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2001).
Training in mindfulness-based interventions has dem-
onstrated signiﬁcant positive psychological and physiolog-ical outcomes in clinical and nonclinical populations (Baer,2003; Kabat-Zinn, 1993; S. L. Shapiro, Schwartz, & Bon-ner, 1998). For example, research in mindfulness-basedinterventions has found decreased depressive relapse(Teasdale et al., 2000), decreased anxiety (J. Miller,Fletcher, & Kabat-Zinn, 1995), enhanced immunologicaland physiological functioning in cancer patients (Carlson,Speca, Patel, & Goodey, 2004), increased sleep quality(S. L. Shapiro, Bootzin, Lopez, Figueredo, & Schwartz,2003), and more rapid clearing of psoriasis (Kabat-Zinn etal., 1998).
In addition, recent research has found positive asso-
ciations between measures of mindfulness and psycholog-ical and physical health outcomes (Baer, Smith, Hopkins,
Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006; Brown & Ryan, 2003). Forexample, the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale wasinversely related to depression, anger, and anxiety andpositively correlated with optimism, positive affect, andself-esteem in both adult and college student samples(Brown & Ryan, 2003). Further, the Mindful Attention andAwareness Scale was inversely correlated with medicalsymptoms and number of visits to medical professionals.Two other measures of mindfulness, the Kentucky Inven-tory of Mindfulness Skills (Baer, Smith, & Allen, 2004)and the recently developed Five Factor Mindfulness Ques-tionnaire (Baer et al., 2006), have also been associated withpsychological health.
Further, mindfulness has been integrated into numer-
ous innovative psychological interventions. For example,mindfulness is a component of dialectical behavior therapy(Linehan, 1993), control therapy (D. H. Shapiro, Astin, &Schwartz, 1996), and acceptance and commitment therapy(Hayes, 2002), and it is also being developed for use withaddictive behaviors (Marlatt, 2002), sleep disorders (Ong,Shapiro, & Manber, 2006), and disordered eating (Kris-teller, Baer, & Quillian-Wolever, 2006).
Despite the important ﬁndings and the innovative
ways mindfulness is being introduced into psychological
intervention, it is important to note some methodologicallimitations of the past literature on mindfulness-based in-tervention. There are three crucial components that havenot been adequately addressed in the literature: (a) long-term assessment, (b) testing against randomized compari-son groups, and (c) teasing out explanatory mechanisms.Future research should use well-controlled designs com-paring mindfulness-based intervention with comparisongroups and should assess long-term implications. And yet,preliminary evidence, including a number of randomizedcontrolled trials (Carson, Carson, Gil, & Baucom, 2004;Teasdale, Segal, & Williams, 1995; S. L. Shapiro et al.,1998), is promising.
Empirical questions. One hypothesis regarding
why mindfulness-based interventions contribute to greatermental health is that they cultivate cognitive balance byteaching participants to change their relationship to
3The contemporary Vipassana tradition of Buddhist meditation gen-
erally equates mindfulness with “bare attention” (Gunaratana, 1991), andrecent scientiﬁc studies of mindfulness practice have adopted that ap-proach (Bishop et al., 2004). This deﬁnition, however, does not reﬂect themeaning of mindfulness (Pali: sati; Sanskrit: smrti ) as expressed in many
authoritative Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist sources. As the Buddhist scholarR. M. L. Gethin (2001, pp. 36–44) pointed out, the primary meaning ofthe Pali term sati is recollection, and many traditional Theravada and
Mahayana sources emphasize its qualities of taking hold of the object ofattention without forgetfulness (Asanga, 2001, p. 9; Buddhaghosa, 1979,p. 524; Gethin, 2001, pp. 36, 40, Vasubandhu, 1991, p. 190). Thus, thereappears to be a discrepancy between the current usage of this Buddhistterm and its more traditional usage, for which there is general conformitybetween the Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. This is not to detractfrom the widespread meaning of mindfulness today, but it is important torecognize how it diverges from the more traditional Buddhist meaning ofmindfulness and its implementation in practice (see Wallace, Bays, Kabat-Zinn, & Goldstein, 2006).

thought. This is a supposition at odds with current cogni-
tive theories (Beck, 1976; Ellis, 1962). Although bothmindfulness and cognitive therapy underscore awarenessand self-monitoring in the present moment, their funda-mental approach to thoughts is different. In mindfulnesspractice, the goal is to change one’s relationship tothoughts instead of changing the content of thoughts them-selves, whereas cognitive therapy emphasizes the latter(Teasdale et al., 1995). The meditator, therefore, developsa metacognitive state of detached awareness of thoughts,prior to engaging in any evaluation or intent to change theircontent. It would be interesting for future research to ex-amine how each approach can be used effectively and forwhom.
Affective Balance
According to our model, affective balance is a natural
outcome of conative, attentional, and cognitive balance, butaffective imbalances also impair those other facets of men-tal health (Goleman, 1997, 2003). As we deﬁne the term,affective balance entails a freedom from excessive emo-
tional vacillation, emotional apathy, and inappropriateemotions. So deﬁned, the cultivation of affective balance isvirtually equivalent to the development of emotional reg-ulation skills. An affective deﬁcit disorder has the symp-toms of emotional deadness within and a sense of coldindifference toward others (Wallace, 2005b, pp. 151–152).Affective hyperactivity is characterized by excessive ela-tion and depression, hope and fear, adulation and contempt,and infatuation and aversion. Affective dysfunction occurswhen people’s emotional responses are inappropriate to thecircumstances at hand, for example, taking delight in some-one else’s misfortune or being disgruntled at others’success.
Psychologists and contemplatives the world over have
devised a wide array of interventions to heal such affectiveimbalances, some of them applicable to people in general,others imbedded in speciﬁc religious worldviews. Bud-dhism treats affective imbalances with many speciﬁc meth-ods for countering such mental afﬂictions as craving, hos-tility, delusion, arrogance, and envy (Khyentse, 1993;Shantideva, 1997; Thondup, 2000, pp. 110–122; Wallace,2001a).
In addition, Buddhism presents a system of meditative
practices designed to counter affective imbalance by culti-vating the qualities of (a) loving-kindness, (b) compassion,(c) empathetic joy, and (d) equanimity (Aronson, 1980;Salzberg, 2002). These are deﬁned, respectively, as (a) theheartfelt yearning that oneself and others might experiencewell-being and its causes, (b) the heartfelt yearning thatoneself and others might be free of suffering and its causes,(c) delight in one’s own and others’ joys and virtues, and(d) an impartial sense of caring for others’ well-being,regardless of one’s own self-centered likes and dislikes(Wallace, 2004). In one method for cultivating loving-kindness, for example, one begins by yearning for one’sown happiness and its causes, then gradually extends thisaspiration to dear friends and loved ones, strangers, andﬁnally even enemies (Salzberg, 2002). The ideal is tocultivate loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and
equanimity for all beings impartially (Davidson & Har-rington, 2002).
Support from Western psychology. The
cultivation of affective balance and the qualities of loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity thatpromote this balance need to be subjected to empiricalresearch to determine their health-promoting effects. Thispioneering research has begun. Carson and colleagues(2004) recently conducted a randomized controlled studyof chronic pain patients and found that loving-kindnessmeditation signiﬁcantly decreased pain as well as de-creased psychological distress. Further, greater amounts ofdaily loving-kindness meditation practice were associatedwith decreased back pain and anger.
Another study examining empathy, which is central to
empathetic joy and compassion, suggests that this qualitycan be developed through systematic meditation practice,as the Buddha taught. A randomized controlled trial exam-ined the effects of a seven-week mindfulness meditation onlevels of empathy in medical students. Empathy was mea-
sured by a reliable and valid self-report measure (alphacoefﬁcient of .89), the Empathy Construct Rating Scale (LaMonica, 1981). Results indicated signiﬁcantly increasedempathy and decreased anxiety and depression in the med-itation group compared with controls (S. L. Shapiro et al.,1998).
In addition to the central teachings on loving-kind-
ness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity in cul-tivating affective balance, Buddhist practice also focuseson the emotional quality of gratitude (Rinchen, 1997, pp.62–67). Psychological research has conﬁrmed the impor-tance of this quality for psychological and physiologicalwell-being. For example, in a randomized trial, adults whokept a daily journal and listed all of the things for whichthey were grateful reported signiﬁcantly increased feelingsof happiness and increased health-promoting behaviorscompared with controls (Emmons & McCullough, 2003).
Empirical questions. All of the noted studies
focused on self-report measures, which are inherently lim-iting. Future research could contribute greatly by extendingthis research with the examination of behavioral and neu-rological changes. Further exploration is needed to deter-mine for which populations and disorders affective trainingis most effective. Is training in affective balance moreeffective than training in cognitive balance for speciﬁcdisorders? For example, would loving-kindness meditationbe a more effective intervention than mindfulness trainingfor depression, or might it be optimal to combine thosetypes of practice?
A Summary of Well-Being and
Mental Balance
Well-being, as presented in this article, is not simply stim-
ulus-driven pleasure, emerging occasionally on the hedonictreadmill of life. Rather, it is a way of ﬂourishing thatunderlies and suffuses all emotional states, one that em-braces all of the vicissitudes of life. In short, it is a way of

engaging with life based on a wholesome way of life,
mental balance, and a sound understanding of reality.
The Buddhist assumption behind the pursuit of well-
being is that one’s habitual state is afﬂicted because ofmental imbalances but that one’s deeper nature underlyingthose mental imbalances is healthy and ﬂourishing (Ruegg,1989; Waldron, 2003; Wallace, 2006b, Wallace & Hodel,2006). Whereas Western psychology commonly assumesthat ordinary people are psychologically well and that theysuffer mentally because they are susceptible to disease anddysfunction, Buddhism declares that ordinary people areprone, to varying extents, to all four of the mental imbal-ances described in this article and that they suffer becauseof them (Tsong-kha-pa, 2000). Although certain kinds ofmental imbalances are inborn and vary from one individualto the next, they can be either increased or diminished as aresult of child rearing, education, and other societal inﬂu-ences (Tsong-kha-pa, 2000).
According to Buddhism, people’s minds are not in-
trinsically unbalanced, only habitually so, and with contin-ued skillful effort, these imbalances may be remedied,resulting in a state of well-being that is not contingent onagreeable sensory, behavioral, intellectual, or aestheticstimuli (Dhamma, 1997). This is a point on which psychol-ogy and Buddhism may converge and collaborate for thebeneﬁt of everyone. Our fourfold model of well-being is anattempt to facilitate such a collaboration. Below we high-light critical questions, the exploration of which will con-tinue the mutual enrichment of Buddhism and Westernpsychology.
Future Directions
There are numerous promising avenues for future research
in developing a partnership between modern science andBuddhism (S. L. Shapiro & Walsh, 2003; Walsh & Sha-piro, 2006). Our development of the fourfold model ofwell-being is one attempt. However, for research to ad-vance, precise working deﬁnitions of hypotheses and con-structs must be established. Further, reliable and validmethods of measurement need to be developed.
Speciﬁcally related to this fourfold model, the next
steps are to deﬁne, operationalize, and develop psychomet-rically sound assessment measures for well-being and thefour types of mental balance. This work has already begunwith the development of a psychological well-being scaleacross multiple dimensions of well-being (Ryff & Singer,1998). However, additional measures taking into consider-ation the speciﬁc insights offered from the Buddhist per-spective in terms of the four aspects of mental balancecould enrich the scientiﬁc study of well-being. For exam-ple, there is a need for assessment measures that explicitlyassess well-being that is not dependent on external circum-stances (e.g., “Imagine all of the external supports for yourpresent sense of happiness and security suddenly disap-pearing. What sense of well-being remains?”).
These assessment measures could then be included in
clinical trials of meditation practice to determine whethercultivation of all four mental balances does indeed lead togreater well-being, which is our hypothesis. However, itwould also be interesting to examine the effects of devel-
oping any one of the mental balances but not the others.
Western psychology offers the rigor of scientiﬁc tech-
nology and empirical study to the wealth of techniques andsystemic practices that Buddhism has developed. It has theability to measure the behavioral and neuropsychologicalcorrelates of speciﬁc Buddhist methods. Such researchcould conﬁrm, challenge, reﬁne, and expand on the modelof mental balance proposed in this article.
Conclusion
The possibilities for mutual enrichment between Buddhist
teachings and Western psychology are numerous. The in-tention of this article is to present an innovative model in anattempt to bridge the ancient Buddhist system of mentaldevelopment and contemporary scientiﬁc approaches tomental health and well-being. Speciﬁcally, we introduce atheory of well-being and the means of achieving it throughthe systematic cultivation of four types of mental balance:conative, attentional, cognitive, and affective. Our inten-tion is for this article to catalyze rigorous innovative re-search into the potential mutual enrichment of Buddhismand current psychological theory, research, and practice.We believe Buddhist insights can continue to be developed,enhanced, and adapted by Western psychological theory,expanding the horizons of both disciplines for the beneﬁt ofall.
