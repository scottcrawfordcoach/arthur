“Should” Detox
The “Should Detox” BY Canada Coach Academy
“Should” is a very powerful word. It not only creates excess pressure and guilt, it
allows people to live in a fantasy of what “should be” vs dealing with “what actually is”.
It is too easy for us to stay stuck in disappointment and negative self-talk when we are
battling the fantasy of how we think things should be, and avoiding what is.
Language is a powerful place to start to create awareness. Try this “Should Detox” to
move from victim to empowered in your day to day language:
STEP 1.
Keep this exercise simple. Think about the last time you used the word “should” in
reference to something you "should have done".
For example, “I should exercise more.”
Now repeat that sentence and write it down:
I should exercise more
Pause and observe. How does it feel to say that? Note where that feeling sits in your
body.
STEP 2.
Replace “should” with “could”.
I could exercise more
How does the “could” sentence feel? What changes? Pause and observe.
STEP 3.
Replace “could” with “can”.
