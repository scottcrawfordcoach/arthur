Rapport & Connection
Rapport is a consequence of being genuinely
connected to another person. It is a consequence
of authentic listening, and this is a consequence
of making space for another person.

Breakout! Are you conscious listening?
Coachee:
Tell a happy story for 1 minute.
Stand up and shake it off!
Tell an angry story for 1 minute.
Stand up and shake it off!
Close your eyes.  Think of one of the two stories . Focus on that
story. Keep your eyes closed.  Coach:
Consciously listen.
Don’t speak! Listen!
When the coachee closes their eyes, guess which story they are
thinking about.
Happy or sad?
