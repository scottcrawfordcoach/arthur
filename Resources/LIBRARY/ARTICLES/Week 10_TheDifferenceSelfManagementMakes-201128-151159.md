From Good to Great Coaching:  The Difference Self-Management Makes Written by Jennifer Porter, Graduate of Bates College and the Stanford Graduate School of Business, an experienced operations executive, and an executive and team coach. This article has been adapted for coaching. We know that coaches need self-awareness to move from being good to being great. Self awareness is an understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, feelings, thoughts, and values — as well as how they affect others. But that’s only half of the story. Self-awareness is useless without an equally important skill: self-management. For example, a coach I am mentoring, we’ll call him Rick, serves as a case in point. He has been given repeated feedback that he speaks too often and for too long in coaching sessions. He has told me that he wants to improve this behaviour and learn how to listen more and partner more in order to help his clients make progress. After a recent coaching session with one of his long time clients we met for mentoring. He said he was aware that he spoke for 30% of the time. I asked him to evaluate his session. He replied, “I know I spoke too much but I had a lot of points to make.” He then continued to tell me more about his ideas.  Rick is an example of a coach that is very self-aware, but he isn’t as effective as he could be because he doesn’t self-manage. Self-management is a conscious choice to resist a preference or habit, and instead, demonstrate a more productive behaviour. It’s a four-step process: 1.Be present. Pay attention to what is happening in this moment — not what was said 15 minutes ago or what will happen in your next meeting. 2.Be self-aware. What are you seeing, hearing, feeling, doing, saying, and considering? 3.Identify a range of behavioural choices. What do you want to do next? What are the possible consequences of each action? What feedback have you gotten that might inform your choices? What are some alternative choices you can make — even if they’re not what you want to do or what you usually do?
4.Intentionally choose behaviours that are believed to be the most productive. What behaviour will generate the best outcome — even if it’s not the behaviour that comes easiest to you? For Rick, self-management would look like this: 1.Be present: “I’m focused on the client, really listening to language, and paying attention to body language, tone, inﬂection and cadence.” 2.Be self-aware: “I notice I’m excited and eager to share my ideas. I want to give an example. I also recognize this would be self-serving, and I know I have a tendency to speak too often in sessions, which can stop my client from speaking or from progressing their thinking on a situation.” 3.Identify a range of behavioural choices: “I could ask for permission to share something I am observing, invite deeper reﬂection with good questions , or hold space and listen silently.” 4.Intentionally choose behaviours that are believed to be the most productive: “I’m going to withhold my comments and instead listen to what my client has to say. Even though I really want to share my ideas, I know the impact on the client is to rob them of their experience. By listening, putting my ego aside and getting really curious I will be giving my clients the space to solve their own problems.” What makes self-management so hard goes back to the deﬁnition. The most productive behaviours are often not aligned with our habits and our preferences. (If they were, we would not need to manage ourselves.) Behaving in ways that aren’t aligned with your preferences can make you feel uncomfortable, unskillful, and worried about how you come across. Operating in ways that contradict our habits can evoke similar negative reactions. With a habit, our brain creates a shortcut and moves from stimulus to response without thinking, saving both time and effort. But non-habitual behaviours require us to think about a situation, consider choices, make a choice, and then demonstrate the behaviour that aligns with that choice. This takes work. The auto-pilot efﬁciency of habits is what make them so hard to change. It’s easier and more pleasant to default to an old habit than it is to invest the energy in creating a new one.
Despite these barriers, self-management is a learnable skill. This is how you can start: 1.Decide where you want to self-manage. Pay attention to how you typically operate — what you say and do and what you don’t say and don’t do. Identify instances where your current approach is not working as well as you’d like, and self-management might be useful.  2.Notice and reﬂect on what’s driving your lack of self-management. In those moments where you’re not self-managing but would like to, notice how you feel, what you want, and how you are interpreting what’s going on around you. What is driving your actions? Is it lack of awareness in the moment, wanting to look good, lack of skills, insecurity, or something else?Understanding why we make the choices we make is crucial to changing those choices. 3.Consider your choices and your reactions to those choices. Instead of your default behaviors, if you were self-managing, what else could you do? What is your reaction to those options? Notice how your preferences and habits show up here, and ask yourself what you are trying to avoid when you default to those habits and preferences. Sticking with the example of talking too much in a coaching session, one option you might consider is waiting 5 seconds to speak when the inspiration hits. Now, consider your reaction to that option. Are you afraid you’ll lose your train of thought and you’ll miss an opportunity to give advise, or maybe that your client won’t think of ideas as good as yours? Consider the motive behind those reactions? do they serve the client or you? 4.Make a plan. Now that you know what you want to change, better understand what’s driving you, and have identiﬁed some options, think of concrete steps you can take. If you talk too much in a coaching session, your plan might include deciding how much you say when you do speak and for how long, or you may decide to only ask questions and not make statements for a whole session…. or use clean language to run the entire session! 5. Practice. Old habits are hard-wired into our brains. To change them, we need to create new neural pathways (new habits), and this requires practice. If we stay with the example of talking too much in a coaching session, practice might look like counting the seconds before you speak — hold your tongue and your comment may not be relevant anymore. Do this repeatedly until you are consistently able to self-manage that behavior. At the same time, explore your reactions to your practice. What can you learn from what you’re doing, and from how you’re reacting, that can inform your continued practice?
6.Repeat the process. Go back to step two and observe your efforts, reﬂect on your choices, revise the plan, and practice some more. In each successive iteration, you’ll learn a bit more about how you’re operating, what’s driving your behaviour, and how you can improve it. It’s natural to behave in ways that feel good and familiar — to not self-manage — and yet, if we did this all the time, we’d never get better at anything. To become as effective as possible, leaders need to move beyond self-awareness to self-management. Start by recognizing your current actions, considering alternative options, and then putting in the hard work required to resist what may be most familiar or comfortable. Instead, commit to effectively executing what is most productive.
