Something I've adjusted in my training recently that's made a big difference is I've got resistance bands to attach my waistband to the back of my heels when I'm running, that's to try and make sure I have a more efficient form and that I really engage my hamstrings because they're kind of lazy. I think it will make a big difference in the future but for now all it means is my calves are sore, my times are slower, my heart rate's higher and Garmin thinks I've got less fit. That's what you've got to do if you want to change something up.
