My mornings have been kind of messed up recently because I've been waking up early with a lot on my mind and not going back to sleep. One small thing I've done I suppose that makes that more tolerable is that I treat that time as almost like extra time I've got to relax and do some planning and thinking before the day starts in that I almost weirdly now look forward to it. So we could argue whether that's a benefit if it's almost making me keen to get out of bed but absolutely rather than agonise about the fact I didn't sleep well I just try to enjoy that extra time that I got.
