Level 1 Dialogue
I have to have a difﬁcult conversation with my brother. He asked for my
help with a start up project. Im a communications expert with an MBA in
business and I am currently working on my PhD in Business Strategy. I put
in a number of hours on the communications side and I’ve been advising
him on the ramp up strategy- but he hasn’t paid for my time yet - and i
know the business is doing well. He suddenly went quiet this week. And I
have a really bad feeling. I feel like he’s taking advantage of me. Always
calling me little sis. Like he doesn’t value my contribution.
That sounds serious. What are some of the reasons you think he went
quiet?
I don’t know- I think his wife might have something to do with it. Not that there is anything wrong with her. I just know he is avoiding me and it’s
probably because he doesn't want to admit my advice has helped him. I
know he is using my ideas.  It’s so frustrating.
What do you think is standing in the way of him admitting you helped him?
I think he just sees me as his little sister and doesn’t want to give me the
credit he knows I deserve. He’s 4 years older than me and has always treated my like a kid. He can’t get past that.Coachee

I heard difﬁcult conversation. What makes this a difﬁcult conversation?
It’s uncomfortable. My brother and I have always been close, and we tell each other everything. It’s been a week since we’ve spoken - and until
now we would normally speak everyday. I just know there is something up-
something he is avoiding with me.
What assumption could you be making about his silence?
Silence….. Well, I guess I’m assuming if he valued me and my contribution we would have spoken by now.
If you knew without a doubt he valued you, what approach would you take
with him?
I would not hesitate to call him.Coachee

We just had a baby. The house is a mess. My wife is not doing so well
emotionally. I barely have time to breath at work—and I’m the lead on
launching a new division- a project that starts tomorrow.
I know exactly what you are going through. It happens to the best of us.
Stay focus on work and your long-term vision.
Uh. Okay, and that’s actually the problem though. I can’t focus. And I feel guilty for not being more helpful at home. I’m travelling all the time- I was
gone for 10 days; 3 days after the baby was born! My wife is feeling
abandoned and she’s crying a lot. I’m really not pulling my weight at home.
I know it seems hard now, but babies grow up. It will all work out. Don’t let
it distract you from providing for your family and nailing this launch.
Families go through this all the time. Mine sure did.
This feels like more than just a moment or something that will pass. I want
to be there for my wife. I want to know my child.
For sure your family is important- but they won’t be any better if you lose your job too!  So, let’s focus on this launch and make sure you nail it.
Sure, ok.  Coachee

launching a new division at work- a project that starts tomorrow.
Tell me more about that.
It feels like I’m going to let somebody down. Like I have to choose who to
disappoint. I know if I don’t help out with the baby and support my wife more she could ﬁnd herself depressed or she may even go live with her
mother! And if I don’t step up at work, well the team will suffer- so will the
bottom line.
That’s a tough situation. It sounds like you only have two choices really- no
matter which way you look at this. What do you think?
Ya- I feel trapped- like there is no way out. I will let everyone down.
Let’s look at come options- Is there anyone who can take over the launch
at work. You might just need to give up a bit on both sides. And how about your mother-in law, can she help with the baby? Coachee

•Led by the coach
•Solutions mode
•Empathy and acknowledgement, with a desire
to provide answers.
•Closed, leading questions
•Still focused more on the problem than on mindset.
•Focus is negative and therefore energy is negative.

I can see how important this is to you. What does it feel like when you do
have time to breath?
Like there is enough time for everything. I feel in control.
And how are time and control related?
Hmmm, (silence) when I have time to breath, I have time to plan and think
about the next steps- see the big picture you know- I’m not so caught up
in the moment.
So what happens when you take a step back now, what do you see in the
big picture?
(Silence). I see a lot of people around us- both at home and at work- who
are offering and willing to help. We have a great support system.  Coachee
