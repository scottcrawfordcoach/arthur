Discover Your Mission
Unleash Your Vision
To be a great coach is to live with mission & vision that guide
your purpose; your reason for being.
 of 111
Step 1: Reﬂection
1. What is most important to you about becoming a coach?
2. What difference do you want to make as a coach?
Step 2: Tell your story
Your life is made up of a series of experience that have shaped you. You
are a complex puzzle of emotions, beliefs, and values that have guided every decision you’ve ever made.
 of 211
To discover yourself is to reﬂect on the story of your life.
Think about the time line of your life so far. What events stand out the
most? Which ones come to mind right away?
Choose 4 pivotal events in your life that shaped who you are in this
moment right now. Events, good or bad, that changed you. Events that you
made meaning of and they inﬂuenced your decisions thereafter.
Give each event a name. Describe what happened in detail.
How did it make you feel?
What matters the most about this event?
What emotions come up for you as you write about it?

Step 3: Choose a Coach!
The best coach for this exercise is one who does not know you. Find a
coach that will be your mirror. Your coach is an objective person to help
you discover new perspective and observe your emotion and body
language as you tell your stories.
A good coach in this exercise is unfamiliar AND safe- someone who will
hear your stories for the ﬁrst time.
Step 4: Coaching session
*There is a separate coach guide for your coach.
You will be coached for minimum 1 hour (maybe 2 hours) by a coach of
your choice in your group. Your coach will use the Coach Guide (see separate tool) to coach you through the exercise and write down detailed notes about your events.
After you explore each event with your coach, return to this notebook with
your coach to continue your exploration.
Step 5: Categorizing Themes
Now, with at least 6 themes, start to organize themes into Role and Effect.
Role  is the inﬂuence you have (what you can do or contribute), and Effect
is the impact your role has on others. The coach can continue to ask you clarifying questions to help you consider perspectives.
 of 711
ROLE : Write actions or verbs - contributions you can make to others as a
coach.
Example: theme is “overcome difﬁculty”,  ROLE  might be “to enable others
to overcome challenges” or if the theme is “openminded”, the ROLE  might
be “to help others embrace new ideas”. EFFECT: What difference will you make in someone else’s life?  The effect
is what drives you, inspires you and is your motivation for the role you want
to play.
Example: when your ROLE  is “to enable others” the EFFECT is “others
feel empowered to achieve extraordinary results”.
If you are unsure if a theme is a ROLE or EFFECT, review the event to see
how the theme emerged. Is the theme a result or an action that was taken or an outcome that you felt?
Step 6: Role & Effect
List 4 ROLES you identiﬁed in the themes (phrased as actions).
1._____________________________________________________________
2._____________________________________________________________
3._____________________________________________________________
4._____________________________________________________________
 of 811
List at least 2 EFFECTS (effects are the impact your role has on others).
Look at the Roles you listed and ask yourself, "what do I want others to
feel, do, or be as a result of my role or impact on them?”)
1._____________________________________________________________
2._____________________________________________________________
Step 6: Your Mission & Vision
StatementS
Review your list of ROLES and EFFECTS. Select one from each list that
really stands out.
Start by selecting your EFFECT. Which one describes the difference you
want to make in the world?
EFFECT : ______________________________________________________
Next, select your primary ROLE. Which one describes what you will offer
others as a coach?
ROLE: _______________________________________________
A strong Mission & Vision Statement is simple, clear, afﬁrmative and
inspiring. It is free of “what’s” (keep job title, industry, function OUT of it)
and it is your guiding light.
 of 911
Your mission is constant- it goes beyond professional - it is who you are in
the world.
Remember:A mission statement is in service to others- so avoid using “I” or “me” or
referring to yourself. This statement is to the world- it’s about ﬁnding fulﬁllment which comes from being in service to others.
A mission statement is written in positive language- what you want, not
what you don’t want.
Example: “To  ﬁght against evil so that we can live in peaceful world” shift
it to say “To  stand for good so that we can live in a peaceful world.”
Now ﬁll in the following statement:
# Role Effect
“To___________________ so that_____________________________________” Your mission doesn’t change, but how you express it might. Spend time
crafting and reworking it. Say it out loud. Say it to others. Get curious about how it lands on others.
You will have a chance to share your Mission and Vision statement with
your group! Write your final statement here:
