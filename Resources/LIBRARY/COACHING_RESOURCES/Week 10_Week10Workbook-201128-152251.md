From Good to Great Coaching
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Self-Awareness
Self-awareness
is an awareness
of one's own
personality
or individuality.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Self-Awareness
Research suggests when
we see ourselves clearly,
we are more conﬁdent and more creative. We build
stronger relationships, and communicate more
effectively.
Though most people
believe they are self-aware, few of us actually are.
Studies estimate only
10%–15% of people are
self-aware.

ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Self-Awareness
There are two types:
1) Internal self-awareness
Represents how clearly we see our own thoughts, feelings, behaviours, strengths, and weaknesses
and our impact on others.
2) External self-awareness
Means understanding how other people view us. People who know how others see them are more skilled at showing empathy and taking others’ perspectives.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Self-Awareness to Self Management
Self-management builds on the basis of self-awareness.
It is the ability to control your emotions
so that they don't control you.

Self-management is a skill
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Self Management
Self Management requires doing some homework,
seeking disconﬁrming evidence, and questioning our
habitual ways of responding and being.
Don’t ask “why”? - it's a surprisingly ineffective
self-awareness question.
Ask “what”? “What” questions help us stay objective,
future-focused, and empowered to act on
our new insights.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Moving from good to great
Who is in charge, the thinker or
the thought?
Many thoughts interfere with self-
management.
The objective as a coach is not to
stop the disruptive thoughts, but to notice them, create awareness and choose a new behavior.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Disruptive Thoughts
1.Assuming thoughts
2.Monkey mind
3.Labelling
4.Righteousness
5.Emotional selﬁshness
6.Sympathy vs empathy
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Assuming thoughts
Example:
Sounds like:
•Jumping to conclusions
•Allowing no time between stimulus and response (being reactive)
•Letting assumptions guide you
•Getting pulled into the story
 Strategy:
•Hold your tongue (twirl, count to 3)
•Ask yourself: am I reading this right?
•Use “Tell me more” to buy time
•Ask questions to refrain from making statements“There must be an ulterior motive….”
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Monkey Mind
Example:
Sounds like:
•Internal chatter- mind clutter
•Relating what the coachee says back to your own
experiences
•Thinking about things outside the session
 Strategy:
•Bring your mind back to the moment
•Pause, breath and square your shoulders to your client
•Actively reset your engagement with parroting
•Own your distraction and ask for forgiveness“Oh, I remember last week when that same thing
happened to me….”

ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Labelling
Example:
Sounds like:
•Putting people in categories or “boxes”
•Coaching from your  beliefs, not theirs
•Judgement overtakes curiosity
•Letting cultural bias get in the way of objectivity
 Strategy:
•Dance in the moment- accept not knowing
•Reach for curiosity
•Notice your judgement and shift to learner
•If you act on it, ask for forgiveness“Yikes, she seems paranoid….”
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Righteousness
Example:
Sounds like:
•Want to prove you are “right”, “smarter”; “better”
•You look for a win/ lose situation
•Your ego wants the stage
•You offer advice
 Strategy:
•Break down the ego with mindfulness & awareness
•Use bridge words like “so”, “and”, “what else”
•Check for meaning: “What does “hurt”” mean for you in
this situation?
•Use P.O.P.“She must be so ashamed….”
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Emotional Selfishness
Example:
Sounds like:
•Bringing your experience and meaning into the
coachee’s space
•wanting to understand
•Making the conversation about you and your perspective
•Personalizing
•Using “I” or “we” or “let’s"
Strategy:
•Coach from their perspective, not yours
•Reach for compassion and empathy
•Let go of your desire to understand
•Acknowledge them to appreciate who they are“You’ll be ﬁne, I was when it happened to me….”

ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Sympathy (vs Empathy)
Example:
Sounds like:
•Diving into emotion with your client
•Subjectivity vs objective
•Your default is relating
 Strategy:
•Reach for empathy- helicopter coaching
holds the container
•Offer appreciation
•Hold the mirror up
•Observe to offer feedback“Oh my gosh, that is horrible….”
Great coaches learn to
self- manage

You have a choice!

Take Away
Self-Management starts with self-awareness however it
doesn’t end there. Self-management requires reﬂection,
strategy and practice.
Judgement blocks connection and reinforces
separateness!
Ask yourself,
As a coach, what interferes with my ability to create a safe
space for the coachee?
