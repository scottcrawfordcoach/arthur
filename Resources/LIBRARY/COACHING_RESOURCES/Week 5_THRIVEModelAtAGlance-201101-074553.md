TOPICThe presenting issue. It’s like starting a car after a long winter. It’s a conversation starter to get the words, ideas and thoughts flowing.  HONENarrow down the Topic. Honing is all about getting clear on what your coachee wants. It’s like a ship sailing in the night guided by the beacon of a light house. Honing is the process of setting a direction and focus for the session. REALITYMoving people from subjective (the story) to objective (what is actually happening). Your job is to hold the mirror up for your client. Coaches facilitate self awareness.

# Intro-
SPECTIONTaking ownership of impact is a key component
of change. Help your clients understand their
impact and how fear might be holding them
back. It’s like facing your demons and
projections. Take people through the “what is at
risk” conversation.  If fear is present: define the
fear, the ask: how can you prevent it, how will you
repair it, what's at risk if you do nothing?
VALIDATE Help your client step out of the box.  Validate
involves creating steps for achieving goals.
Partner in brainstorming options! It’s like field of
dreams, if you build it they will come.  Small steps
are powerful! One or two is all you need for
progress that leads to transformation.
EXECUTEHelping clients manage progress and be
accountable for changes they want to make in their lives during the coaching session. You witness the client’s commitment to change. It’s like the
client giving themselves homework. This is about
progress, not results. It’s about learning and growing, not shaming!
