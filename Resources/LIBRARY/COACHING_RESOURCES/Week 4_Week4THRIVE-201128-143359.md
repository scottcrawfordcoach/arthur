# Topic
TopicThe presenting issue.  It’s like starting a car after a
long winter.  It’s a conversation starter to get the
words, ideas and thoughts flowing.
Mindset:
When I believe that talking through things helps clarify thinking, then I know  letting a coachee talk freely is the start of clarifying and progressing thinking.  Tip: Rule of +/-7
ASK: What’s on your mind?
What’s important today?
What has your mind occupied these days? And? What else?TM
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
# Hone
HoneNarrow down the Topic . Honing is all about getting
clear on what your coachee wants.  It’s like a ship
sailing in the night guided by the beacon of a light
house. Honing is the process of setting a direction and focus for the session.
Mindset: Honing goals begins the process of change. Your role as a coach is to witness the goal and help your clients simplify their objectives. Tip According to a Harvard study, 83% of people do not set goals.
ASK:What would you like to have at the end of
our session today?
What will be different when you have that?  What does success look like? What will you have that you don’t have now? TM

ICF Life & Wellness Coach
# Reality
RealityMoving people from subjective (the story) to
objective (what is actually happening). Your job is
to hold the mirror up for your client.  Coaches
facilitate self awareness.
Mindset:
Raising awareness is the first step to creating new
choices. With new choices comes new decisions
and new behaviours follow.
Tip: Walk your coachee up the stairway of
consciousness.
ASK:Tell me about what is happening?
What is your role in this?
What do you want to have happen? What assumptions might you be making? What else could be true? Then what becomes possible?
What new possibilities emerge?TM
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
# Introspection
Intro-
spectionTaking ownership of your impact is a key component
of change. Help your clients understand their impact
and talk through what might be holding them back.
It’s like facing your demons and projections . Take
people through the “what’s at risk” conversation.
Mindset:
People are whole and resourceful- therefore they
know what to do- so get curious about what is
holding them back? Put fear, worry, anxiety, dread
on the table.
Tip:
Get really curious!
ASK:What’s holding you back?
Define it!
What can you do to prevent that?
How can you repair the worst case scenario?
What is within your control?
What is the cost of doing nothing?
What’s do you give up to stay the same?TM
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
# Validate
ValidateValidate involves creating steps for achieving
goals. It’s like field of dreams, if I build it they will
come. Validate the learning and self awareness
created in your session.
Mindset:
Partner to brainstorm (question-storm) ideas with your client. Get creative about steps to take to
achieve the goal. Step out of comfort zone!
Tip:
Small steps lead to transformation. Validate the
work done to explore and create new possibilities and choices with action to make progress.
ASK:What are some small step you can take?
What if resources were unlimited?
What would you do if you had no fear? When you believe you will succeed, what steps come to mind? What else? And? What have you seen others try?TM

# Execute
ExecuteHelping clients manage progress and be accountable
for changes they want to make in their lives during the coaching session. You witness the client’s commitment
to change. It’s like the client giving themselves
homework.  This is about progress, not results. It’s about
learning and growing, not shaming!
Mindset: Transformation begins with small steps.
Tip:
Accountability framework
ASK:What will you do first?
When will you do it?
Who can support you?
How will you execute? What might stand in your way?
What stands out today/ what are you leaving with?
Is there anything else you need to feel complete?TM
