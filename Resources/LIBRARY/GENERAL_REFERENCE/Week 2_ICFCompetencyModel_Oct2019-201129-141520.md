Updated ICF Core Competency Model
October 2019
Following a rigorous, 24-month coaching practice analysis, the International Coach Federation
is announcing an updated ICF Coaching Core Competency Model. Th is competency model is
based on evidence collected from more than 1,300 coaches across  the world, including both
ICF Members and non-members and representing a diverse range of  coaching disciplines,
training backgrounds, coaching styles and experience levels. Th is large-scale research
initiative validated that much of the existing ICF Core Competency Model, developed nearly 25
years ago, remains critically important to the practice of coaching today. Some new elements
and themes that emerged from the data have also been integrated  into the model. These
include a paramount emphasis on ethical behavior and confidentiality, the importance of a coaching mindset and ongoing reflective practice, the critical distinctions between various
levels of coaching agreements, the criticality of partnership b etween coach and client, and the
importance of cultural, systemic  and contextual awareness. Thes e foundational components,
combined with emerging themes, reflect the key elements of coac hing practice today and will
serve as stronger, more comprehensive coaching standards for the future.
