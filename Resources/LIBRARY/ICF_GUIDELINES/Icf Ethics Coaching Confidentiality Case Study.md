Standard 2.1 –  Case Study
Maintain the strictest level of conﬁdentiality
Background
As an ICF Professional, I maintain the strictest level of conﬁdentiality with all parties involved,
regardless of the role I am fulﬁlling.  Conﬁdentiality is very important in a coaching relationship.
Having a clear agreement outlining what will remain conﬁdent and what could be shared is an important piece in building a safe and healthy relationship with your client(s). And ICF deﬁnes
conﬁdentiality as the protection of any information obtained in or around the coaching relationship
unless there is a legal reason or requirement, a threat of harm, or written consent to release is given
by the client.
Case Study
Ivan had been coaching several individuals within an organization for the past year. The organization
knew that Ivan had been planning to retire at the end of the year and they had asked him if he had
any recommendations on who could continue coaching beca use it had been beneﬁcial for these
several individuals.
Ivan recommended Katya to the organization. They were a similar personality type to Ivan,  and he
felt that they could take  over his role. Katya asked Ivan to meet to discuss the individuals that they
would now be coaching. When Ivan agreed to meet Katya, he began to think about what information
he could or could not share with Katya. Ivan had no doubt they were going to be a good coach, but
surely the rules of conﬁdentiality would still apply.
Implications for Coaching
• Conﬁdentiality should be a top priority. When there is a shift in coaches, the client(s) should be involved in determining what information is and is not allowed to be shared. There
should already be a determination within the agreement of what can and cannot be shared
between the coach and the organization. (ICF Code of Ethics, S tandards  1.1, 2.1, 2.2 and
2.3)
• Each individual client should be introduced to Katya separately. They have the right to determine if they want to continue to be coached if someone new is taking over the coaching agreement. (ICF Code of Ethics, S tandards  1.1, 1.2 and 2.2 )
Possible Outcomes or Next Steps
• Revisit your coaching agreement . This is a great time to take a look at what the coaching
agreement says around conﬁdentiality. Including Katya in the discussion would be very beneﬁcial in case they have questions or want to make any changes. Then include the representative from the o rganization to ensure that they can agree with any changes.

• Meet with each individual . This is a great time for Ivan to introduce Katya to each individual
within the organization who is being coached. If it is not clear what can be shared with
Katya, that should be determined ahead of time with the individuals.
Discussion Points
• How should Ivan decide what can or can not shared with Katya , if anything?
• If you were Ivan’s coach supervisor, how would you support him?
