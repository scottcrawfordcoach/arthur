Standard 2.3 –  Case Study
When conﬁdential information may need to be disclosed.
Background
As an ICF Professional, I have a clear agreement with Client(s), and Sponsor(s), and other involved
parties about what conﬁdential information may need to be disclosed to the appropriate
authorities, e.g., illegal activity, required by law, valid court or der, or subpoena; and imminent/likely
risk of danger to self or to others. Sometimes conﬁdential information must be shared to the
appropriate authorities. And sometimes it is requested by a client where they give you permission
to share otherwise conﬁde ntial information. Every case is different , and all aspects should be
considered before deciding .
Case Study
Charlotte had been coaching Liam for six  months when she received a letter from a lawyer
representing Liam. He had been going through an ugly divorce and they had two  children together.
Charlotte’s main clients were divorcees, and she considered this her specialty area.
The letter stated that Liam wanted Charlotte to testify on his behalf that he was an excellent father
and a man of great character. His former wife was trying to say that he was a shady businessman
and that he was verbally abusive to their two children. Charlotte felt torn because she didn’t know
him as a father or as a businessman. She could speak about his good character, but she was n’t
sure if she wanted to get involved. It felt different with children involved and coming from a verbally abusive home her self, she wasn’t sure she wanted to take that chance .
Implications for Coaching
• Conﬁdentiality should be a top priority. However, when someone asks for you to speak on
their behalf, it can really depend on the situation. (ICF Code of Ethics, S tandards  1.1, 2.1
and 2 .3)
• Any kind of abuse may be viewed as a risk to danger to others. You should check with your
local laws to see if you would be considered a mandated reporter.  (ICF Code of Ethics,
Standards  2.1, 2.3, 3.2, 3.4  and 3 .5)
Possible Outcomes or Next Steps
• Open communication . Since Charlotte is on the fence about this situation, she can be
open with her client. She does not know her client in the father role nor as a businessman. Charlotte can decline if she’s not comfortable because this is not court ordered or required by law.
• The importance of professionalism . Charlotte may need to excuse herself from this favor
because of her own personal experiences in a verbally abusive home. Or Charlotte may

need to speak with her client about what his ex -wife is claiming. She also may consider
seeking outside opinions of those who know her well to see what they would suggest.
Discussion Points
• What does your agreement say regarding what information is not kept conﬁdential?
• Does it matter if Charlotte cannot remain unbiased? Why or why not?
• If you were Charlotte’s coach supervisor, how would you support her?
