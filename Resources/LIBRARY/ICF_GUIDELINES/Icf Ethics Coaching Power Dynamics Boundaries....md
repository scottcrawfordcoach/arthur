Standard 4.1 –  Case Study
Manage any power difference
Background
As an ICF Professional, I am aware of and, in partnership with my client, actively manage any power
or status differential between us that may be caused by cultural, relational, psychological, or
contextual issues. Sometimes people put others up on a pedestal even without the encouragement
of the person wanting to be viewed as a hero or savior. But it’s important for an ICF Professional to be aware that it could happen and remain alert to any indications that this is happening.
Case Study
Nathan had been coaching for 20+ years and was well -known in his coaching community of
colleagues. Dominque had recently started coaching and was still developing a strong base of clients. At an ICF Chapter event, Dominique had been the speaker about creating a website that would attract more clients. This was his other passion outside of coaching. Several people stuck around to ask him more questions afterwards and he loved being able to help each of them. The
last person was Nathan, who Dominique had only  heard about, but had never officially met him.
Dominique’s palms got sweaty as Nathan approached him to ask him a few website questions.
They instantly bonded and were laughing and cutting up by the end. They decided to walk out
together to their respective vehicles. Dominique mentioned that he was sti ll working on growing his
business, and it seemed that he had reached his pique.
Nathan offered to set up a mentoring relationship with him if he would be interested. Dominique was in awe and quickly agreed to it. Over the next several months, Dominique did everything that Nathan recommended that he do to grow more clients. Nathan was a little uncomfortable with the
“god” status that Dominique had seemed to give him, but not enough to say anything. Nathan
brushed it off and thought it was more like a father, son relationship. A few months later, Nathan
received an email from Dominique s aying that he wanted to end the mentoring relationship. He
hadn’t grown his client base and had met another coach who he wanted to  hire as a mentor coach.
Nathan was sad about the end to this relationship. And as he reviewed the situation, he began to
wonder if he could have managed the perceived power difference that Dominique had
automatically given him.
Implications for Coaching
• ICF’s deﬁnition of coaching –  “partnering with clients in a thought -provoking and creative
process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. ” A
coaching relationship is built on a partnership and equality.

• ICF’s deﬁnition of mentoring –  “a collaborative process where coaches receive feedback
based on observed sessions to reﬁne their skills and style in alignment with ICF Core
Competencies.” A mentoring relationship is built on collaboration and partnership .
Possible Outcomes or Next Steps
• Managing the power difference . It will be healthy for Nathan to revisit his relationship with
Dominique to see if there was anything that could have been done differently. Maybe
Nathan could have pushed Dominique to get to the answers on his own. Or perhaps Nathan
couldn’t have done a nything differently. An honest evaluation of this relationship will be
healthy for Nathan regardless.
Discussion Points
• What should Nathan have done differently, if anything?
• When you have a client who looks to you for advice, how do you handle that power
difference?
• If you were Nathan’s coach supervisor, how would you support him?
