Standard 3.3 –  Case Study
Resolving any Conﬂict of Interest
Background
As an ICF Professional, I resolve any conﬂict of interest or potential conﬂict of interest by working
through the issue with relevant parties, seeking professional assistance, or suspending or ending
the professional relationship. Managing biases and conﬂicts of interest are important and can be
hard to do in a coaching relationship. If you become aware of a conﬂict of interest, then it’s up to
the coach to bring that up and provide an opportunity for discussion.
Case Study
Becca had just moved back to her hometown where she had grown up to help take care of her
elderly parents. Thankfully all her coaching business was online clients and so the move hadn’t
affected her business in any way.
Becca and her siblings, along with their parents, ﬁnally found a retirement community that everyone had a positive reaction to the facility and staff. Because Becca had been gone for the last several years, she found herself visiting her parents the most to make up for lost time. One day, as
she was leaving the facility, she ran into the CEO of the retirement community. They were having
such a nice conversation, that they decided to sit down for coffee and ended up discussing the
beneﬁts of coaching, spec iﬁcally team coaching.
By the end of the conversation, the CEO was seriously considering hiring Becca to offer team
coaching to the directors of the retirement community. Becca was so excited for this opportunity,
and they made plans to follow up with each other in the next seve ral days.
The next day, Becca met with her coach supervisor, Andy, for their regularly scheduled meeting.
Becca told Andy about the conversation and how excited she was for this opportunity. But before
she accepted it, she wanted to know what Andy thought about it. He started asking her questions
around any potentials for conﬂict of interest.
Implications for Coaching
• Becca and Andy can look together to determine if there is any conﬂict of interest or
potential conﬂict of interest. They can also look at the possibility that she may have
personal limitations because her parents live there and how could she keep that in check.
And last of all, she will have multiple agreements with this organization so what will that
look like for her. (ICF Code of Ethics, Standards 3 .2, 3.2  and 4.2)
• Becca could adjust her coaching agreement to set expectations of how this relationship will
work with her parents living there as well. It may never be an issue but having it within the

agreement can help alleviate any questions or misunderstandings. (ICF Code of Ethics,
Standard s 1.1, 3.2 and 3.3 )
Possible Outcomes or Next Steps
• What happens if she accepts . It really depends on Becca and if she can remove the fact
that her parents live at this retirement community. Would she be able to put aside any bias
and how would others view this partnership are questions to consider.
• Honest about the multiple agreements.  Perhaps Becca and the CEO can craft a letter to
the staff and honestly communicate that while her parents live there, no one should receive
special treatment. If Becca does accept the position, she will need to keep an ongoing
handle on the potential for conﬂict of interest.
Discussion Points
• If you were Andy, how would you support Becca?
• What potential conﬂicts of interest could you see coming up?
• What would you do in this situation?
