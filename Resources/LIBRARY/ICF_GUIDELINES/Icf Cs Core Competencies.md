  Updating the ICF Core  Competencies

Summary
The primary objective in undertaking the 2025 global coaching  job analysis was  to
understand how coaching practice has  evolved since the previous job analysis in
2019. The aim was to identify any new competencies that are now essential for
coaches, to determine any competencies that are no longer relevant, and revise
existing competencies where necessary. Updates to the ICF Core Coaching
Competency model were made through rigorous, evidence -based methods to
assess how the Knowledge, Abilities, and Other Characteristics (KAOs) of coaching
have changed.

The 14-month job analysis used a variety of methods, including literature reviews,
focus groups, analyses of tasks and knowledge, abilities, and other characteristics
(KAOs), surveys, and a review of the existing competency model.  These approaches
were designed to (a) identify changes in the coaching profession since the last
update in 2019 and (b) determine how those changes could guide updates to ICF's
competency model.  This competency model is based on the data collected from
nearly 3,000 coaches across  the world, including both ICF Members and non-
members and representing a diverse range of coaching disciplines, training
backgrounds, coaching styles and experience levels.

While no new main competencies are  introduced, five new sub -competencies have
been added, and revisions have been  made to 11 existing sub -competencies.  One
competency definition was updated,  and a  glossary of terms has been added . The
glossary can be found in the a ppendix .
