Updated ICF Core
Competencies

Released October 2019

Updated ICF Core Competencies

© International Coaching Federation   2
 Following a rigorous, 24 -month coaching practice analysis, the International
Coach Federation is announcing an updated ICF Coaching Core Competency
Model. This competency model is based on evidence collected from more than
1,300 coaches across the world, i ncluding both ICF Members and non-members
and representing a diverse range of coaching disciplines, training backgrounds, coaching styles and experience levels. This large -scale research initiative validated
that much of the existing ICF Core Competency Model, developed nearly 25 years ago, remains critically important to the practice of coaching today. Some new
elements and themes that emerged from the data have also been integrated into
the model. These include a paramount emphasis on ethical behavior and
confidentiality, the importance of a coaching mindset and ongoing reflective
practice, the critical distinctions between various levels of coaching agreements,
the criticality of partnership between coach and client, and the importance of
cultural, systemic and contextual awareness. These foundational components,
combined with emerging themes, reflect the key elements of coaching practice
today and will serve as stronger, more comprehensive coaching standards for the
future. The ICF updated Core Competency  model will go into effect in the second
half of 2021.
