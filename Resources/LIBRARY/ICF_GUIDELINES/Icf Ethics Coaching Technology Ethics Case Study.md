Standard 2.5 –  Case Study
Ethical Obligations within Technology
Background
As an ICF Professional, I fulﬁll my ethical and legal obligations to my coaching client(s), sponsor(s),
colleagues and to the public at large directly and through any technology systems I may utilize (i.e.
technology -assisted coaching tools, databases, platforms, software, and artiﬁcial intelligence).  The
latest in technology can be the scary unknown. Some won’t touch it, and others have been playing
around with it for years. There are times when it can be very helpful to use, and there are other times
when a little more research is needed before signin g an agreement. As an ICF Professional you are
responsible for understanding what technology you are using.
Case Study
Grace had just graduated from an ICF accredited Level 1 organization. She joined ICF as a member
the next day and continued to work on acquiring her 100 hours of coaching experience so she could
apply for her ACC. The accredited organization reached out to her a week later to let her know that a
coaching platform was looking to hire a few coaches, and they felt that Grace would be a good ﬁt.
During her interview with the coaching platform,  she was poised but  screaming with excitement on
the inside. She would have no issues gaining her 100 hours of experience with this group. By the end
of the interview, they made her an offer and she gladly accepted it.
Grace had befriended her mentor coach from the ICF accredited organization and called her with
the great news. During the conversation, the mentor asked her if she was familiar with the privacy
and conﬁdentiality p olicies  with this platform. Grace hadn’t even considered that aspect and after
the call quickly started to research the platforms data privacy policies on their website.
Implications for Coaching
• Conﬁdentiality should be a top priority. When sensitive information may be shared during a coaching session, the client should feel conﬁdent that the information will not be used or
shared in any way. (ICF Code of Ethics, S tandards  1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.7 )
• Technology and artiﬁcial intelligence are  already making an impact within coaching. The
more aware coaches are of what is offered , and the more research is done, the more
conﬁdent a coach can be in using technology. ( ICF’s Research and Technology section)
Possible Outcomes or Next Steps
• Coaching Platform Standards . Grace could read through this document that is on ICF’s
website  on what issues she should be aware of as a coach. Examples of issues could
include GDPR policies, where is data stored, and data being deleted automatically.

• Data protection and security . The coach must take appropriate precautions when
possible and attempt to understand the platforms security plans. Speciﬁcally, how does the
platform handle the data that is collected about each client?
Discussion Points
• What does Grace need to consider when working with a coaching platform?
• If you were Grace’s coach supervisor, how would you support her?
