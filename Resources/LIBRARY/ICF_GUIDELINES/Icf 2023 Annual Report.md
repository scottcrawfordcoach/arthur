significant moment. Inspired by our shared passion for coaching, the event showcased the strength of collaboration through thought-provoking discussions, content-rich presentations, invigorating networking sessions, and community engagement.

This year’s report celebrates what can be
accomplished through collective action, shared knowledge, and diverse perspectives.

performing coaches and organizations who are helping to improve workplaces, transform lives, and contribute to global social change. They were recognized during a special awards ceremony at ICF Converge 2023.
The ICF Coaching Impact Awards are an evolution of ICF’s previous

Together We Thrive   |  2023 Annual Report          6
Leveraging the strength of the ICF ecosystem
and our global network, we have launched
several initiatives to raise the profile of coaching and highlight the valuable resources we offer. By spotlighting the power of coaching, we are positioning ICF as the premier organization for impactful connections and high-quality coaches.
Some key tactics we’ve implemented include:
•Ad campaigns across a variety of
dig
ital platforms.
•Lead generation forms and email
nur
ture campaigns.
•Targeted messaging via key
stak
eholder partnerships.
# Amplifying Our Social
# Media Reach
Social media is a powerful tool for reaching
new stakeholders and strengthening existing relationships. This year, we focused on expanding our social media reach, resulting in record growth in followers and engagement.
We know coaches are lifelong learners committed
to personal and professional development. So, we shifted our social media strategy to provide more educational content. On Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, we shared
coaching tips through short-form videos, carousel posts, and infographics. This resonated with our followers — interactions with our content increased 100% in just one year.
# Boosting Website Traffic
# And Engagement
Our website is critical for increasing awareness
of ICF and promoting the value of the coaching profession. In 2023, we took a closer look at search engine optimization (SEO) and the quality of content. We also relaunched the Coaching World blog with a stronger focus on SEO to boost traffic to our website and elevate the profile of contributing authors.
The total number of website users has jumped
nearly 40% since 2022, and the length of time a user remained on the site has increased by over 20%.
We achieved this record growth amidst significant
changes to how website metrics are tracked, particularly with Google’s transition from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4 (G4), altering many of our benchmark data and key performance indicators (KPIs). We adapted to these new standards, adjusted our reporting accordingly, and continued to see growth.   SOCIAL INTERACTIONS

To make our vision a reality, we must champion
diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB)
across the coaching profession worldwide.
Our DEIB department continues to expand its work in amplifying all voices within the coaching community and ensuring every perspective
is valued.
# Deib Training & Resources
Building an inclusive and equitable coaching community requires an investment in education to enhance diversity intelligence. We must strive to make this education more accessible. This year, we added more training options and resources, including a biannual four-part DEIB Chapter Leader Training, and introduced three DEIB Chapter Champions to support chapter-level DEIB initiatives.
We also created the:
•Generational Differences Workshop, which is
an interactive workshop that explores global
considerations in working across generations,breaking down stereotypes, and more.
•Disability Inclusion Training Manual, an in-depth
90+ page training manual that provides coaches,educators, and organizations with the materialsneeded to serve those with disabilities or thoseimpacted by disabilities effectively.CHAMPIONING INCLUSION:
# Member Resource Groups
Central to our DEIB strategy is providing educational and discussion opportunities to members, staff, and other individuals in the ICF ecosystem and throughout the coaching community. Furthering our work in this area, we launched three Member Resource Groups (MRGs) to help underrepresented ICF members overcome obstacles that impede growth. MRGs offers supportive communities for diverse coaches through resources, workshops, events, and other course offerings.2023 MEMBER RESOURCE GROUPS
148 BIPOC (Black, Indigenous,

Together We Thrive   |  2023 Annual Report          8
As our world grows increasingly complex, so do the ethical
dilemmas that coaches may find themselves in. We must
grow, adapt, and evolve to meet these complexities so that our
community can continue to confidently embody the highest level
of excellence in ethical practice.
# Meeting Growing Needs
The number of ethical complaints received by ICF — and their
complexity — have grown exponentially over the past few years. So
has awareness of the ICF Ethical Conduct Review (ECR) process
among clients and coaches. To better address these complaints, six
new volunteer leaders were added to the ICF Independent Review
Board (IRB), which oversees the ECR. With 32 applications received,
it’s clear that our members are deeply interested in upholding the
professionalism and integrity of the coaching industry.
You can learn more about the IRB and the ECR on our website.
# Exploring Contemporary Issues
It’s important for the ICF Code of Ethics to remain current and
relevant as the profession continues to grow and mature. For
this reason, we initiate a review of the Code every three years to
address contemporary issues and ensure consistent alignment and
understanding for global coach practitioners.
In collaboration with the Code Review Steering Committee, we
began the latest review in mid-2023. Their work was focused on
data collection, through surveys and interviews with stakeholders
across the ICF ecosystem and getting a Code Review Team
established to draft an updated Code of Ethics.
Work on the Code review is ongoing and anticipated to conclude
in 2024. ETHICAL CONDUCT AND COMPLIANCE REPORT
ICF members and credential-holders worldwide are unified by
their shared commitment to ICF’s high ethical standards. ICF’s ECR
process, Accreditation Complaint process, and intellectual property
management activities all help promote the integrity of the
coaching profession and the ICF brand. The 2023 Ethical Conduct
and Compliance Report provides an overview of these activities.
REGULATION: COMMITTED TO PROTECTING
# Our Profession
As interest in coaching grows globally, government regulators and
legislators are taking a keen interest in our profession.  Each year,
ICF proactively engages in conversations with these stakeholders
to ensure that ICF members and credential-holders can practice
without undue governmental interference. In 2023, ICF was
actively involved in regulatory interests across Europe, the United
States, Brazil, and other locations worldwide. To learn more about
ICF’s Self-Regulatory efforts, please review the
ICF Advocacy Toolkits.
"Participating in the Ethical Conduct Review (process)
involves so much more than just adjudicating allegations
of ethical breaches... rather, it constitutes a tangible
contribution — even an investment — that ICF makes to ensure the professionalism and integrity of our
self-regulated profession.”
— Cathy Pantano, PCC, IRB Member

Incredible. Enriching. Valuable. These are just a few of the words that ICF
Converge 2023 attendees used to describe their experience. This event was more
than just a conference; it was a catalyst for change, a celebration of purpose, and a beacon of inspiration.
Converge 23 — our first in-person event since 2019 — brought together
like-minded professionals and industry influencers to ignite creative thinking,
push boundaries of what’s possible, and connect over a common purpose to
transform the world through coaching.
Coaches not only traveled from all around the world to Orlando, Florida, USA, but many others joined online through a livestreaming component. We created an inspiring collective energy that fused passion and purpose. This energy reminded us that our community is a force for positive change.
Attendees participated in specialized sessions and learning paths designed
to elevate their coaching skills. Driven by the change-maker mentality of professional coaches, Converge 23 also included opportunities for attendees to volunteer their time and expertise to support local community initiatives.  LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT, EVENTS, & VOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT

Partnering to Amplify Our Impact
Strategic alliances are vital for expanding ICF’s global and
local reach. By collaborating with key organizations, we amplify our impact, grow more effectively, and pursue our vision of a world where coaching is integral to transforming societies.
# Strengthening Strategic Alliances
Recognizing the importance of strategic alliances,
we have:
• Added a new department to focus on establishing
and collaborating with organizations that have synergy with ICF.
• Solidified existing strategic partner relationships,
including the Association of Change Management Professionals (ACMP).
• Developed an alliance framework that identifies key
selection criteria for evaluating new opportunities.
• Expanded our ne twork of alliance partners.
New alliance partners in 2023 include:
• American University in Cairo.

Expanding Opportunities for Educators
Coach educators are critical in elevating the
standards of coaching worldwide. In 2023, ICF Coaching Education launched several new offerings to better support coach educators in developing the next generation of coaches, ensuring they are better prepared to handle the dynamic demands of today’s world.
# New Accreditation Portal
At the start of the year, we introduced the ICF Accreditation Portal. Within this tool, coach educators have one easy-to-use dashboard where they can submit accreditation applications and renewals, check the status of applications in real time, and communicate directly with ICF Coaching
Education staff.  The portal has provided a more
simplified experience for coach educators so they
can spend more time focused on their students.
# New Advanced Accreditation
# In Team Coaching
Team coaching is in demand. And it requires a specific set of competencies and knowledge. With this in mind, we introduced the Advanced Accreditation in Team Coaching (AATC) in February.
This advanced accreditation enables coaching
education providers to demonstrate that their education aligns with the needs and requirements
to prepare coaches for this complex discipline.
By December, there were 72 providers with
this accreditation.
# Evolution Of Accreditation
The coaching profession is ever-changing, and
our global accreditation model must reflect contemporary needs. Over the last two years, we partnered with ICF-accredited providers to evolve our global accreditation model to better meet the current leading practices in education and accreditation. In 2023, we completed this evolution as all ICF-accredited providers updated their curriculum to meet the new ICF accreditation standards.

# Global Knowledge Community
The ICF Coaching Education Global Knowledge
Community is an active online platform where ICF-accredited providers can connect, access resources, continue their professional development opportunities, exchange best practices, and get answers to critical questions from their peers, experts, and the ICF Coaching Education staff.

skills are of an equally high quality. People who are looking for
a coach don’t want just anyone claiming to be a coach. They
want someone who has been trained on that specific skill.”
— Janeen Antonelli, PCC, Associate Director of Coaching at The Doerr
Institute for New Leaders at Rice University, an ICF-Accredited Provider

catalysts for workforce engagement and develop

RESOURCES + KNOWLEDGE =
# Empowered Organizations
Our member organizations already demonstrate
the business impact of coaching. Through this membership, organizations openly connect, learn, and share about the successes and challenges of their coaching cultures. The value of this membership ripples back into each member organization’s coaching program and into the lives of its employees, transforming the way they work.
Throughout the year, we offered more than 50+
unique webinars, programs, and toolkits to our organizational members, including:
• 12 Deep Dive sessions, which enable members
to network and discuss best practices, new trends, and tips that affect internal coaching such as team coaching and return on investment (ROI). • 5 Organizational Member Spotlights, which
feature articles about members’ internal
coaching programs.
• 15 webinars about coaching cultures.
• 8 sessions in collabor ation with the ICF
Internal Coaching Community of Practice.
• 5 presentations during ICW.
• 20+ coaching culture sessions at ICF Converge,
including a pre-conference workshop with more than 100 attendees and an exclusive executive breakfast for member organizations.
• 2 organizational coaching toolkits packed with
implementation tips.
# Telling The Story Of The
# Importance Of Coaching Cultures
Now more than ever, organizations must embrace
coaching cultures to address employee burnout, skills gaps, employees’ desire for professional growth, and more. Through building relationships with various media outlets, we secured 40+ media placements showcasing the impact and value of coaching in organizations. ICF-credentialed coaches and staff provided
interviews to leading publications, including Chief Learning Officer (CLO), Fast Company, and HR
Executive; participated in podcasts like Voices of CLO; and spoke at renowned events such as the Lab Manager Academic Summit.
“ICF Coaching in Organizations is a
very valuable forum to learn about the
actual implementation and practice of
coaching at other companies. It is also
an opportunity to be introduced to and
interact with like-minded coaches, to
learn that other companies are similarly
struggling to implement it in their
organizations who do not understand
the effectiveness of coaching, and to be
encouraged that we are not alone and
that we can reach our destination if we
keep trying.”

ICF credential-holders have an unwavering
dedication to professionalism and ethics. ICF
Credentials and Standards has an unwavering dedication to our credential-holders and to serving as an important mark of quality to coaching clients. We find purpose in what we do by recognizing excellence in coaches.
Here are few initiatives we pursued throughout
the year to continue raising the bar while also setting coaches up for success:
• Foundation for New Competency
Development: In collaboration with ICF
Coaching Education and ICF Research and Data Science, we conducted global job analyses for mentor coaching and coaching supervision. These analyses will establish best practice standards and competencies to guide practitioners in these vital areas.
• Resources for Credential Candidates: To assist
candidates on their credentialing journey, we published comprehensive Candidate Guides, equipping candidates with the tools they need to seamlessly determine their eligibility, prepare application materials, schedule and complete exams, and plan for renewal.  • Exam Pilot to Ma tch ACC Experience:  We
launched the ACC Pilot Exam, which was
carefully developed to test an ACC candidate’s coaching knowledge. With more than 700 participants, this pilot has set the stage for a new ACC exam.
# Advanced Certification In
# Team Coaching
Team coaching is among the fastest-growing disciplines in the profession as more organizations recognize that they must harness their team’s collective talents to thrive. In early 2023, we launched the Advanced Certification in Team Coaching (ACTC), setting rigorous standards to recognize those who demonstrate advanced knowledge, skills, and abilities in team coaching.
Offerings like the ACTC — and the Advanced
Accreditation in Team Coaching — are an example of how we continue to lead industry-wide improvements to professional standards, education, and consumer experience. Coaches are now better prepared to work in this complex discipline, and coaching clients can more easily identify coaches with this expertise.
“Credibility. Robust assessment. World class.
This certification gives testament to the
experience, knowledge, and expertise that
I have gained over the years in leading
teams to achieve business success, but also
as a coach, to partner with the team to
maximize their abilities and potential.”
— Choy Kiew Cheong, ACTC, PCC

GLOBAL GROWTH + COMMITMENT TO BE THE BEST
= COLLECTIVE IMPACT
As more individuals around the world are turning to coaching to
transform their lives, more coaches are committing to the gold standard in coaching. In January, our community achieved a first in our history: 50,000 active ICF credential-holders worldwide!
The number of ICF credential-holders has grown 400% over the
last decade. But it's more than just numbers; it reflects the growing impact of coaching worldwide. In 1998, we welcomed the first 34 ICF credential-holders — all of whom were from North America. Today, we are 50,000+ strong, living and working in more than 140 countries and territories in every region of the world.

# Supporting Leaders
# Amidst Conflict
When the war in Ukraine broke out, coaching
emerged as a beacon of hope. The ICF Foundation,
the ICF Ukraine Charter Chapter, and Academy
DTEK united to offer executive coaching to 500
leaders across Ukraine and Europe.
Monthly coaching sessions, conducted in English
and Ukrainian, allowed these leaders to explore
beliefs, values, and aspirations while developing
coping strategies, emotional intelligence, and self-
care practices.
• 150 ICF coaches donated 1,310 hours (valued at
$393,000 USD).
• Leaders reported significant improvements in
coping strategies, communication, productivity,
engagement, and operational efficiency. OPENING DOORS TO

Access to high-quality coaching education
remains out of reach for many worldwide. ICF
Foundation Scholarships are breaking down
barriers, making sure coaching is available to
underrepresented populations. In 2023, we more
than doubled the number of scholarships awarded than in the previous year:
• 22 scholarships (+175%) a warded representing
recipients in 10 countries (+150%).
• Estimated value of $102,000 USD (+55%).
• Scholarships are pr ovided in partnership with
ICF Coaching Education, ICF Credentials and

Uniting Coaches for Growth and Excellence
ICF Professional Coaches is dedicated to
empowering our members with the resources they need to achieve continuous growth and excellence. We believe that by enhancing their experiences and providing enriching benefits, we enable them to not only thrive in their careers but also make a profound impact within their local communities. This commitment is reflected in the various initiatives we undertake each year.
# New Global Support Team
In October, we launched the Global Operations Team (GOT) to develop and deliver educational resources that support our ICF Professional Coaches team and chapter leaders. These resources focus on applying association best practices to create operational efficiency and consistency, aligning with ICF’s mission, vision, and goals. Key topics include governance, marketing and communication, and treasurer best practices to ensure the running of a successful chapter.
INSPIRING ACTIONS + MEASURABLE
CHANGE = THE RIPPLE EFFECT
We are torchbearers of transformation. The
inspiring actions of chapters in our local communities ripple out into the wider world.
 Together, we are transforming societies. In any
given year, there are thousands of examples in which ICF chapters create opportunities for their
members to give back and make a substantial positive impact in their communities. Highlights from 2023 include:
• The ICF Oman Chapter hosted the second
ICF MENA Conference in Muscat, Oman, collaborating with 8 Middle Eastern chapters and celebrating the 7
th Middle East Prism
Award for businesses and organizations with strong coaching cultures in the Middle East.
• After years of effort and volunteer work, the
ICF Hawaii Chapter was established and now boasts 55 members.
• The ICF Colombia Charter Chapter
successfully engaged new coaches and members during an event in Cartagena, and inspired conferences in Argentina, Peru, and Puerto Rico.
• Members of the ICF Hungary Charter Chapter
delivered over 1,000 pro bono coaching hours to 100+ organizations. “In 2023, ICF Professional Coaches
served 58,278 professional coaches globally. Our focus was on supporting Chapter Leaders of over 140 chapters worldwide; to drive further global market development in other regions and territories; and aligning with our commitment to exceptional membership experiences and advancing the coaching profession globally.”

“Diverse perspectives.”
In our ever-evolving world, the ICF Thought
Leadership Institute initiates forward-thinking
approaches to help reinvent coaching’s role in promoting societal well-being and human development. By leveraging the collective wisdom of experts and disseminating future-forward thinking, we support a future where coaching can shape a better world.
# Addressing The Landscapes
# Of Tomorrow
Inspiring dialogue. Sparking innovation. Leading the trajectory of coaching. We set out to accomplish these three things with our content. To do so, we must continually approach all we do with a futuristic lens. After identifying emerging needs within the coaching community, we strategically shifted the focus of our content creation in 2023 to look toward the “Future of Coaching.” Within this content collection, we address emerging trends and challenges, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and digital coaching in the coaching landscape, modeling the way for innovative and forward-
thinking approaches.
In addition, we published the Future of Work and Future of Planetary Ecology collections. From these three collections, 60 total articles
were published, covering diverse topics such as reflections, spotlights, and resources. The articles were informed by insights from 34 Wisdom Weavers, or global experts who confront the pressing questions of our day in the spirit of openness and curiosity.
# Groundbreaking Coaching Tool
# To Navigate Disruption
In October, we published the revolutionary
Futures Thinking Framework, a powerful tool for coaches to navigate disruption and guide clients in mitigating risks while seizing opportunities. This multidisciplinary tool equips professional coaches to help them expand their awareness to embrace contemporary thinking, anticipate relevant trends, and facilitate informed decision-making.
