Standard 2.7 –  Case Study
Contact Information Privacy
Background
As an ICF Professional, I maintain the privacy of ICF professionals and use of their contact
information (email addresses, telephone numbers, and so on) only as authorized by ICF or the ICF
professional. It is important to keep your client’s personal information private because that is data
that only they have the freedom to share.
Case Study
Kaylyn had been in the coaching world for about seven  years all together. She had ﬁnally applied for
her PCC last year and was excited to say that she had passed the ﬁrst time through. With her PCC
she found that she was doing more mentoring than she had anticipated and really loved doing it.
All her mentoring to date had been individual mentoring. But she decided she wanted to try offering group mentoring sessions as well. She quickly put together an introductory email to advertise this
new offering and then gathered everyone’s email addresses who she thought would be interested in
these sessions. As Kaylyn proofed the email before sending it out, a big smile came across her face
because she was so excited to try this out and then she hit send.
A couple of email responses came back thanking her for the invite. Then one disgruntled person
sent her a response asking why he could see the list of names and email addresses that she had sent this email to because he did not appreciate having his name a nd email out there for these
other people who he did not know. As she crafted a response back to him, she could feel the embarrassment creeping up her neck and fac e. To be honest, she hadn’t even considered hiding
everyone’s names and emails and she was su re that he would not be the only disgruntled person.
Implications for Coaching
• Privacy and conﬁdentiality are not to be considered lightly. Had Kaylyn let everyone know that she may email them with other opportunities? Perhaps she should have used BCC or
wrote an individual email to each person. If she was careless with their email addresses,
what other information did she feel at liberty to share? All of these are valid questions and
thoughts and are important considerations regarding privacy and conﬁdentiality. (ICF Code
of Ethics, S tandards  2.1 and 2.7)
Possible Outcomes or Next Steps
• Ensure conﬁdentiality . Kaylyn will want to address this with everyone who was on the
initial email that went out. There may be other concerned people, and she will want to listen

to their concerns and address each of them. Kaylyn could possibly come up with a plan to
ensure that this won’t happen again.
• Right to terminate . There may be a few who are very concerned that their information has
been given out to others. Some may even decide to terminate their relationship with Kaylyn ,
and she should remember that it is within their rights to do so.
Discussion Points
• How should a coach send out mass emails without disclosing other’s personal information?
• Was it ok for Kaylyn to reach out to everyone and advertise her plans for group coaching?
Why or why not?
• If you were Kaylyn’s coach supervisor, how would you support her?
