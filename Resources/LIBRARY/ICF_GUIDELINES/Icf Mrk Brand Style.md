WelcomeSince you are holding this guide and reading these words, we’re trusting
you with our very identity: our brand.
We aren’t interested in all of the buzzwords and catchphrases and
marketing jargon surrounding the word brand. But we do care about what people think about us. We care about our reputation. We care about building great relationships.
We also care about growing our organization. But, for us, it’s not all about
numbers. We are passionate about the impact we can make — about empowering the world through coaching.
The following pages are full of guidelines, rules, and handy tips that
we hope will help you communicate our values, realize our vision, and reinforce our brand.
It is impossible to predict every situation, brand execution, or
implementation, but this guide will help refine your approach.
Whether you are a new staff member, an ICF chapter leader, a strategic
partner, or one of our amazing vendors, thank you for helping us achieve our goals and pursue our mission.

This style guide is a reference for our staff,
chapter leaders, vendors, and others who are authorized to work with the ICF brand.
Our intent with this guide is not to restrict
creativity and innovation; far from it. We believe in innovation and creative spirit.
What we strive for is a coordinated,
consistent, and effective brand presence in everything we create. If we make something, we want to make sure that people know where it came from.
While some of our brand executions and
graphics have been standardized — like business cards, letterhead, and envelopes — these are not intended as the focus of this guide.
Instead, the focus of this guide is to
empower you with the elements you need to create. By utilizing these tools, resources, and adhering to the guidelines within, you’ll make things that look like the ICF brand, every time.
Please refer back to this guide often. We
believe that our style guide is a living document. It should evolve over time, just as our brand inevitably will.

This guide is not a comprehensive list of
rules. We recognize the creative journey is full of twists and turns. New approaches, new trends, and changes in technology will inevitably have an effect on our brand and the way we execute it visually.
That said, we insist that any brand
execution follow the guidelines listed within. Anything outside of these guidelines must be approved by an authorized representative from the ICF marketing team.
Outside approvals may be submitted
electronically by emailing the concept to support@coachingfederation.org. If you are a vendor working on one of our brand executions, we require an electronic or physical proof before any item is printed, published, or otherwise executed. These proofs can be submitted to your point of contact within ICF.

ICF was founded in 1995 by Thomas
Leonard, for the purpose of having a space for all coaches to support one another and help grow the profession. The following year, the first issue of ICF Coaching News was sent to approximately 400 subscribers.
Fast forward a few decades, and ICF is the
world’s largest organization of professionally trained coaches, with more than 50,000 members in 170 countries and territories. Together, we are pursuing a powerful vision: Empowering coaches
since 1995.
Creating a world where coaching is integral
to transforming societies.
In 2020, ICF celebrated 25 years of serving
the coaching profession. That same year, we changed our name from the International Coach Federation to the International Coaching Federation, and transitioned from a single organization to a federation of six family organizations:• ICF Professional Coaches.
• ICF Credentials and Standards.
• ICF Coaching Education.
• ICF Foundation.
• ICF Coaching in Organizations.
• ICF Thought Leadership Institute.
As coaching continues to grow worldwide, ICF will continue to evolve to meet the needs of coaches, coaching clients, our communities, and the world. AbOUT  US

The purpose of our brand tagline
is to capture and summarize our brand
promise, brand values, and

• Capitalize the first word following the bullet.

Questions? Contact us at support@coachingfederation.org.
Capitalization, In General
Proper nouns are always capitalized.
Common nouns are typically lower case unless used as part of a person’s title. Learn more about capitalization.
Proper Noun Examples
Capitalize International Coaching
Federation (ICF) and all family organization names in every use:
• ICF Coaching Education.
• ICF Coaching in Organizations.
• ICF Credentials and Standards.
• ICF Foundation.
• ICF Professional Coaches.
• ICF Thought Leadership Institute.
ICF Code of Ethics: Capitalize after ICF or when referring to the ICF Code of Ethics specifically. Lowercase in general use.
EXAMPLE: While other organizations may
not have a code of ethics, we lead the way with the ICF Code of Ethics that has defined the gold standard of coaching.
ICF Core Competencies: Capitalize
following ICF. Lowercase in general use.
EXAMPLE: The ICF Core Competencies are
taught in accredited coaching education. / Hyphen vs. En Dash vs. Em Dash
AP style uses either hyphens or em
dashes, so we do not need to be concerned with en dashes.
Hyphen
A hyphen (‒) is a joiner, such as for
compound words (self-discovery) and compound modifiers (on-demand content).
• If the first word in a compound modifier ends in -ly, do not hyphenate (highly respected expert).
• Or if compound modifier comes after the noun, typically no hyphen is needed (the content is on demand).
• Exception: Due to its Latin origins, pro bono is never hyphenated even if it precedes a noun (pro bono coaching).
• Please do not hyphenate “ICF” with other words.
AP style also uses hyphens for ranges, such as Jan. 1-4. There should be no spaces surrounding a hyphen.
Em Dash
The em dash (—) is used to: • Signal abrupt change, such as to set off
a series within a phrase.
EXAMPLE: The ICF credential — the most
globally recognized coaching credential — is the gold standard.
• Before attribution to an author, etc.
EXAMPLE:  “I didn’t have to wait for anyone.
The superhero was within me.” — Erica Garcia, coaching client
AP style calls for a space on both sides of
an em dash.
ICF Names
International Coaching Federation (ICF): In general, spell out on first reference with ICF in parentheses afterward, following the rules for “acronym.”
ICF Global: Use when it is necessary to
distinguish the international organization from ICF chapters. Do not use “Global ICF.”
EXAMPLE: ICF Global staff met with ICF
Australasia leaders during the conference.
ICF headquarters: Use when referring to
the physical office/address of ICF based in Lexington, Ky. She told him about the core competencies
of coaching.
Specific event names are considered
proper nouns (ICF Converge, ICF Imagine, ICF Global Leaders Forum, etc.), and therefore, are capitalized. Acronyms are also capitalized (CPs, CCE, ACC, PCC, MCC, etc.).
Common Noun Examples
Please use lower case for common nouns,
such as:
• ICF member.
• ICF chapter leader.
• ICF chapter.
• ICF credential.
• ICF credential-holder.
• ACC credential.
• PCC credential.
• MCC credential.
• ICF assessor.
• ICF accredited provider.
• ICF Foundation donor.
• ICF stakeholders.
• ICF ecosystem.
• ICF family organizations.
• ICF departments.bRA nD VOICE

says to follow this rule.
Degrees/Credentials
Include a person’s ICF credential on first
reference in an article or bio. Set ICF credentials (ACC, PCC, MCC) in commas after the last name on the first reference only.
EXAMPLE:  John Smith, PCC, was nominated
as a candidate for the award. John was honored to be nominated.
Use degree titles after the name and
ICF credential.
EXAMPLE: David Johnson, MCC, PhD
Avoid using other (non-ICF) credentials, but if you must, these will appear after the ICF credential.
EXAMPLE: David Johnson, MCC, BCC
Only the ICF credential should be used when representing ICF or in official  ICF materials.
No degree or credential should have
periods: PhD, MBA, CAE, ACC, PCC, MCC.
Numerals
In general, spell out number one through nine, and use numerals for 10 or greater.
 Exceptions:
• If a sentence begins with a number,
then spell it out. (One hundred individuals said...).
• Use a numeral if the number appears in a title/headline (Top 3 Reasons for Coaching).
• Use numerals for unit of measure  (5 CCE units).
Money
The official currency of ICF Global is U.S.
dollars noted by a dollar sign ($) preceding the amount and USD after the amount.
EXAMPLE:  The registration fee is $50 USD.
ICF recognizes the needs of chapters to use locally recognized currency formats.
Phone Numbers
Include area and country code. Use period (.).
EXAMPLE:  1.234.567.8910
Oxford Comma
The Oxford comma is the final comma in a
list of three or more things, and it typically appears before “and” or “or.” Always use an Oxford comma.
Pronouns
If you are using a pronoun to refer to a specific person, please use their preferred
pronoun (he, she, they).
If you are referring to a more general
person (such as a coaching client), use “they” both for singular and plural pronouns.
EXAMPLE:  The coaching client shared their
thoughts. | The group of coaching clients shared their thoughts.
Times and Dates
Months, Days, Years
In general, dates are formatted as the
following: Day of the Week, Month, Day (numeral), Year.
Spell out months and days of the week.
EXAMPLE:  Saturday, January 1, 2023.
ICF recognizes the needs of chapters to
use locally recognized formats.
If a date is within the current calendar
year, you do not need to use the year. If a date refers to something from a past year or a future year, then please include the year with the date.
This year: August 1
In the past: January 1, 1995 In the future: October 15, 2030EXAMPLE:  Send your renewal applications
to ICF headquarters by December 31.
Family organizations: Do not shorten
or use acronyms and include ICF in all instances.

• ICF Credentials and Standards.
• ICF Foundation.
• ICF Professional Coaches.
• ICF Thought Leadership Institute.

Titles
Avoid using courtesy titles such as Mr.,
Mrs., Ms., or Dr.
Job/position titles are to be capitalized if
used before a name and lowercase if used after a name.

Trying to fit the same mark simultaneously
on a billboard and on the side of an ink pen is a challenge. Our identity system is designed for flexibility, consistency, and brand recognition.
Instead of trying to fit a logo into a space
that is too small, use a different version for maximum visual impact and clarity.When using the icon-only mark, ensure that our brand name is visible near or in relationship with the icon. This will help reinforce our brand recognition across multiple touch points.
The wordmark is only to be used in small,
narrow spaces when the ICF brand mark does not fit.

Contrast is the name of the game
when considering placing the logo on
any background.
Our logo should not only be legible,
but it should also make a clear, strong statement when used. If there is not enough contrast between the logo and the background, the presence of the logo is weakened.
The logo may be placed on photographs,
textures, and patterns as long as there is enough contrast for the logo to be visible. Background
Control
Use the one-color blue logo on top of light photographs. Do not use the
two-color version on photographs.
The one-color blue version of the logo may be used on any light colored
gradients or backgrounds.The one-color white version of the logo may used on any dark photographic background. Do not use the two-color version on photographs.
The one-color version of the logo may be used on any dark colored

File Types
The files provided with this guide
generally fall into two types: raster and vector files. While both can be used for most applications, typically one is more suited, depending on the usage intent. Raster Files
Raster files are comprised of a grid of pixels.
These types of files always have a set resolution and size. Once you increase the size past its predetermined size, the quality decreases. You’ve probably seen this before: Images begin to appear pixelated if they’re pushed too far.
Graphics, like the brand logo, can be exported
in raster versions. Photographs are always raster files.
Raster files are typically used for web graphics
and digital executions. When used in print applications, you must ensure that the file exceeds the minimum DPI (dots per inch) of 150DPI, or risk a low-quality print.
Typically, raster files end with .jpg, .png, .gif, and
.psd. They are easy to open and apply.Vector files
Vector files create their shapes by
mathematical equations between anchor points. Since they are crafted by ratios, and not a grid of colored squares, vector images can be infinitely scaled.
Graphics, like the brand logo, are typically
created as vector files. Illustrations, iconography, and graphic elements are created as vector files.
The limitations of vector files lie in their strengths:
Because each relationship is an equation, complex items, gradients, and photographs often make vector file sizes too large. Raster images are more efficient in those situations.
Vector files are typically used for printing or
producing the logo or other graphics in most forms. If you’re ever asked for a high-resolution logo file, send a vector file.
Typically, vector files end with .ai, .eps and .svg.
Without special programs, these files will be difficult to open but are often perfect to submit to vendors. bRA nD LOGO

Contrast is the name of the game when
considering placing the logo on any background.
Our logo should not only be legible; it should
also make a clear, strong statement when used. If there is not enough contrast between the logo and the background, the presence of the logo is weakened.
The logo may be placed on photographs,
textures, and patterns as long as there is enough contrast for the logo to be visible. Background

Legibility and clarity are vitally important to great
typographical layouts. Since most people read from left to right, we should align our type accordingly.
Whenever you place text next to each other, either align
the baselines (the line that the bottom of a lowercase x sits on) or align the x-heights (the top of a lowercase x). This helps align each line visually.
Negative space, or the space around elements, is vitally
important. That being said, if informational elements belong together, move them closer together. Use grouping wisely; just try not to cram too many things in one space!Contrast is the name of the game when it comes to great design. When in doubt, skip a weight when pairing two weights, and double the size between two text elements.
When setting paragraphs, keep an eye on the right
(ragged) edge. If the rag unintentionally creates a recognizable shape, consider tweaking the language or resizing the container. Also, try to prevent single-word lines (orphans).
It is easy for the user to get lost in long lines of text,
and short ones are easily ignored. It’s best to keep lines between 45 and 70 characters long, depending on the size of the font. This will ensure legibility as the font sizes increase or decrease.Using Type01

Photographing People
People are the heart of our brand and should be
treated with the highest respect during all shoots.
In general, you should avoid capturing identifying
features of customers, unless they have signed a release prior to the shoot.
Whenever a person is the subject of a photograph,
they should look relaxed, happy, and engaged. In order for the subject to appear natural, try to capture them “in the moment” instead of posing them. As a general rule, do not have them look directly into the camera lens. PeoplePHOTOGRAPHY
