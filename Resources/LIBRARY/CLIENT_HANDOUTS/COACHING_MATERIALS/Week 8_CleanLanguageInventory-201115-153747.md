client is powerful and makes all the diﬀerence in a coaching conversation that
progresses the clients thinking by creating space for the client to think, while minimizing how much the client is being led or inﬂuenced by the coach.
Clean language begins by creating awareness for yourself about the patterns of
typical conversations. This week we challenge you to have at least 3 “typical’
