Self-Observation Journal
Identify a habitual action/ response that you suspect limits your
effectiveness or interferes with your good intentions or purpose.
Choose a habitual action/response that
(1)is familiar
(2)happens daily
(3)is a trigger; an impulsive emotional r esponse
(4)is a patter n
(5)leaves you with generally negative feelings (guilt, self-doubt, etc)
Name the action/response:
Design a ‘self-observation’!
Using the template on the next pages, commit to observing the behaviour.
The objective is not to change it. It is to simply observe it and become
intimately familiar with it.

Self Observation Design Build an automatic reminder into your day rather than relying on good intentions to be successful.  Commit to the self-observation for at least 4 days. At the end of each day, set time aside (with a built in reminder) to reﬂect in a journal. STEP 1 Describe the habitual action/response you want to change:
STEP 2 Reﬂection Questions: Day 1 1.What would others see if they were observing you? 2.What do you say? 3.What do you feel? 4.What do you do? 5.What do you want in those moments? 6.What do you actually get in those moments? What happened right before the habitual action/response?  (trigger?)canadacoachacademy.com
Reﬂection Questions: Day 2 What emotion came up for you in that moment?What physical sensation came over you?What story did you tell yourself to justify the behaviour?What was the impact on others?What was the impact on you?What could you do differently next time you are triggered?If you did that, what would change?What happened right before the habitual action/response?  (trigger?)What thoughts entered your mind?What emotions followed?What physical sensation came over you?What story did you tell yourself to justify the response?canadacoachacademy.com
Reﬂection Questions: Day 3 What was the impact on others?What was the impact on you?What will you do differently next time you are triggered?What becomes possible then?What happened right before the habitual action/response?  (trigger?)What thoughts entered your mind?What emotions followed?What new awareness did you have, if any?What impact did it have on you?Looking back, what new choices did you have?And what impact would those new choice have on your habitual response/ reaction if you exercised them?canadacoachacademy.com
Reﬂection Questions: Day 4 What intention will you set when you wake tomorrow?What becomes possible then?What intention did you set for the day?What happened right before the habitual action/response? (trigger?)What evidence do you have of increased self- awareness?What do you believe about yourself right now? (in relations to that action/response)What new actions/responses are available to you?What becomes possible when you make new choices?What intention will you set when you wake tomorrow?What impact will that intention have on you?canadacoachacademy.com
