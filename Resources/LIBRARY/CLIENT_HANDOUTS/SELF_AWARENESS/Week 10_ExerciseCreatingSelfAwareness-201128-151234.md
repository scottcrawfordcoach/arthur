Creating  Self Awareness
Record your next coaching conversation using ZOOM or your mobile
phone. Play it back when you have time and you are in a quiet space. As
you listen, notice when  you lacked self -management.

After the session, take 10 -15 minutes to write down your thoughts on
what was going on  for you. Notice the narrative. What “story” are you
telling yourself?

For greater self -awareness that leads to greater self -management,
verbalize your narrative to a friend or someone you trust.

1 What did you do well ?


2 What impact did it have on your coachee ?


3 What d o you want to improve?
4 What impact will this have on your next  coaching session?
5 What becomes possible with feedback?
6 What was your biggest take-away from this exercise ?


The value in Journaling:

Writing this narrative helps you ge nerate a story, and more importantly
generate meaning to that story. One study on the effects of writing
found that it helped with both physical and psychological issues,
developing a coherent narrative over time. The cognitive processing that
occurs when writing has tremendous therapeutic value. Creating a
narrative helps you wrap your head around what’s going on, which helps
take away some of the painful circuitry of mind chatter. And in doing so
creates awareness and the opportunity to consider alternati ve
behaviors .
