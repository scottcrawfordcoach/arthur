Exercise in Self - compassion

Self-compassion is an important predictor of well -being .

Self-kindness refers to  offering warmth and unconditional love and care to yourself.

Self-compassion involves recognizing that you are not perfect.  All people fail, make
mistakes, and have serious life challenges.

Mindfulness is necessary to be able to extend compassion towards the yourself.
Research shows that treating yourself compassionately promotes mental health. For
instance, greater self -compassion has consistently been associated with lower levels of
depression and anxiety .


Compassionate Chair Work

Goal

The goal of the exercise is to access  disparate  facets  of the self, in order  to understand  how they work
together,  conflict,  and how they feel when  experienced  in the present.


Suggestion

The present  exercise works  best if three  empty  chairs  are used,  preferably  in a tri-angular
arrangement.  Because  the exercise  may sound  a bit strange  for clients,  it can be helpful  as a
coach  to demonstrate  the exercise first. Because  clients  sometimes  have little or no
experience  expressing  the supportive  friend  or wise councilor,  they can first play this role.
Moreover,  if clients  find it difficult  to directly  talk to the different  aspects  of the self, a coach can
take a seat in one of the chairs  and physically  represent  the voice  that is being  talked  to.
Although  there  is a fixed sequence  and structure  in this exercise,  sometimes  clients  feel that
they need  to switch  chairs  in between  the separate  parts  of the exercise.  It is good  to let the
conversation  between  the different  voices  be as dynamic  as possible  and take the proposed
structure mainly as a rough guidelines .


Tool Description

Instruction:

Think  of something  that you’ve been self -critical of recently . Each  chair in front of you will
represents  a different  perspective  to help you understand  your self-criticism.

1- The first chair represents a voice of self -criticism.
2- The second  chair represents  the sensation  of feeling  judged.
3- The last chair takes  the perspective  of a supportive  friend .

Your challenge is   to sit in each chair and speak to yourself from the perspective of that
chair. It will feel silly at first! It’s ok! Just go with it. Perspective is everything when
learning to become a coach!

Part 1
First,  sit in the perspective  of the inner critic.  Now,  tell yourself how you think about
yourself and the issue at hand . For example:  “I hate that I am so lazy and can’t  seem  to
get anything  done.” Notice your tone . Notice  the emotions  your words  evoke.  Even
notice  your posture  or general  demeanor.

Part 2
Now move  to the chair that represents  the sensation  of being  judged  (by yourself).  Say
out loud:  how it feels  to encounter  criticism.  For example : “I feel hurt” or “I do not feel
supported.”  Notice  your tone,  emotions,  posture .

Part 3
Now,  engage with yourself  in a dialogue  between  the last two perspectives  (the critical
voice  and the judgmental voice).  Try to understand  how each  perspective  feels.

Part 4
Next, move to the chair that represents the friend or wise councilor. With a  sincere
sense of compassion,  confront  the critical  voice  and the judgmental  voice.  Address  both
perspectives  vocally.  What do you say? How do you relate  to each  perspective  from a more
detached  point  of view?  Notice  your tone and demeanor.

Allow  yourself  enough  time to express  everything  you need  to from each perspective.  Make
sure you leave time  to reflect  on the experience.  How does sitting in each chair change

your perspective?  How will this create awareness for you going forward?
