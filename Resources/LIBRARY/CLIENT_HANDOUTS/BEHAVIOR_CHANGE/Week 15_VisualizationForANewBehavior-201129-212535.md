Visualization For A New Behavior Identify the behavior you want to change. How has that been a problem?  Then, identify the new chosen behavior. What would you rather do instead? Who is a model for you of this new behavior?  Ask permission: Trust your intuitive wisdom, would it be okay for you to Let Go of    (undesired behavior) and to integrate  (desired behavior) and for you to be aware of it consciously? Yes or no? Watch for a congruent YES.  Close your eyes.  How easily can you remember a time when you were doing the behavior that you want to change. Step into that experience (just for a moment) for the very last time, looking out through your own eyes. Be present in the old experience one last time - notice what you see, hear, and feel.  Now inhale a breath, and as you exhale step out of the experience, and see it up on a movie screen in front of you. Relax. Be the observer, and observe the “you” on a movie screen. (watch for your coachee to shift their physiology to express a neutral state).  Now picture your model of possibility, the person who does this new behavior masterfully, next to you on the movie screen. See that person doing the new behavior naturally. Notice his or her posture, breathing, gestures, facial expression. Notice the subtle details in how they move or speak.  See the “you” on the screen next to the role model. Watch yourself practicing the new effective behavior, this time succeeding in the situation. Notice your physiology as you do this behavior easily and naturally. Notice your breathing. Make the image bigger, brighter, crisper, and clearer. Make the colors richer. Build it to a peak. Now, merge with the you on the screen as quickly as you allow this new behavior to integrate at the deepest level of your subconscious mind.  See through your own eyes, hear with your own ears, and feel the feelings. You are fully associated. Experience the situation from the inside, seeing, hearing and feeling yourself taking-action with your new empowering behavior. Make the image brighter and even more vivid. Notice how natural it is. Inhale. Breathe it in. Feel it in your bones. Watch their physiology closely to witness the shift as the new empowering behavior integrates.  Check in. Listen to your body. How does this new behavior feel? Does any part of you object? Or does it feel good?

Future Pace.  Now think of a specific time in the future, where in the past you would have operated from that old behavior, but now, in light of this New Behavior, tell me what's different. (Repeat 3 times)  Inhale a deep rejuvenating breath... bringing all of you back to this moment.  Wiggle your toes and nose, gently open your eyes. Bring all of you back fully to this present moment with your new behavior integrated at every level!
