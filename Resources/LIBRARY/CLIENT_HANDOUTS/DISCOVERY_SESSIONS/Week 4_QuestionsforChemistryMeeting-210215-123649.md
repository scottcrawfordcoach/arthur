Questions for Chemistry/ Discovery Session
Also known as ‘Discovery Meetings’, or ‘Fit Meetings’, the Chemistry Session is an opportunity for the coach to introduce coaching to a new client, or a client new to coaching.
These sessions are typically conducted in the ﬁrst oﬃcial session (many coaches oﬀer this as a complimentary oﬀering as part of the sales process).
Guidelines
Start the session with a question
•“What are your expectations for a positive coaching engagement?”
•Asking a question evokes the client’s understanding of what coaching is and is not, and lets you know where to ﬁll in the gaps.
Oﬀer an introduction to coaching
•Summarize some thoughts about what coaching is, and what to expect from a coaching conversation.
•Some verbiage to consider when describing what coaching is might be:
•it’s a clarifying conversation
•coaching is a ‘what could be’ conversation
•coaching is a change conversation; a collaborative process of nurturing a person’s own inherent motivation for positive change.
•it’s an opportunity to “evoke awareness”; to bring blind spots to light using strategic communication techniques including feedback and observation, mirroring and echoing language.
•it’s partnering to strengthen a person’s motivation for change
•it’s an exploratory conversation to break through ambivalence for change and crystallize goals (what do you actually want, vs what do you feel you “should” want)
•it’s a goal oriented conversation with particular attention to the language of change including beliefs, attitudes, assumptions, and values.
•it’s a partnership of equals designed to elicit a client’s own solutions, promoting their autonomy, responsibility and  accountability to self for the change they want
•it’s a conversation with clear directionality, to move a client with intention and purpose towards what they desire and to explore what is holding them back
•it’s a safe space for clarifying thinking

•it’s a thought provoking collaboration between coach and client to increase awareness and responsibility for impact, breaking through ﬁxed ideas while igniting new possibilities.
•It’s a progressive conversation that partners to build forward momentum
Questions for the discovery conversation

•What will be the measure of success be for you?
•What do you expect from a good coach?
•What will be diﬀerent 3 months from today, after 6 coaching sessions?

Setting the stage for your ﬁrst coaching session
•Reminder, this is a partnership, I am your co-pilot. I am here to witness, observe, and reﬂect with the objective of helping you to clarify your thinking.
•This is a safe space for you to think, without judgment or and without presumption.
•You may experience longer than natural periods of silence- this is me creating a space for you to dig deeper with your thoughts.
•I may interrupt you at times, if I see an opportunity to help you clarify your thinking.
•I will echo your language and often mirror what I observe to help increase your consciousness
•I may use your language, statements or metaphors I hear to help broaden your perspective.
•If I feel we are circling in the conversation, I may ask you to re-state your objective for the session.
•I am not here to advise you, or to mentor you. I am here to aﬃrm, acknowledge and honour you- to help you tap into your full potential by exploring the resources you already have at your disposal.
