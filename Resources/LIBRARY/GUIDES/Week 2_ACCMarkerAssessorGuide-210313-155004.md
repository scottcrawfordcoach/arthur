ICF Performance ACC Qualifying Observations and Feedback
These markers are grouped into eight domain areas and each marker within a domain is checked as to whether or not there was sufficient
evidence for that marker to be checked or observed. Note that for a recording to be scored at or above a passing level  it is not necessary for
all marks to be checked.  IT means there was adequate evidence of demonstrated use of skills in each domain area. The term “Observed”
means the mentor found there was sufficient evidence for that particular marker.  The term “Not Observed” means the mentor did not find
sufficient evidence for that particular marker. The term "N/A" means that the marker was not applicable to the session recording.

Disqualifiers Observations
D1- Coach exhibits breach of Ethics as described in current ICF code of ethics. Observed Partially Observed Not Observed
D2- Coach does not clearly practice the role of a coach, as defined by the ICF,
rather than other roles such as consultant or therapist.  A coach may
occasionally give advice or offer teaching, but that is clearly secondary to the
coach being an explorer with and inquirer of the client.Observed Partially Observed Not Observed
