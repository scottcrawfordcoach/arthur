Metaphors
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
1 in 25 words!
Studies show on average we use a metaphor 1 in
25 words, or 6 metaphors a minute!
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Break Through Fixed Ideas
Metaphors condense
information into
imagery that makes
information more relatable.
They allow us to break
through logic to connect
with something familiar.
They stretch meaning to
images to simplify
communication.

Activity- Breakout!
In groups of 3-4
Create a
metaphor for your
coaching journey

You can create a
group metaphor
or a personal

Metaphor Strategies
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Metaphor As a Road Map
As a coach, identify the metaphor in your coachee’s
language and formulate the questions to help them
extend their view of the situation using their own
metaphor as a roadmap.
Examples:
Coachee: It’s like I’m under water and the sand has just been
kicked up and I can’t see anything.
Coach: What will you see when the water settles?
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Shift Perspective
Metaphors help the client
divert attention from the
complexity of their
thoughts to a story,
symbol or object to help
clarify and expand
viewpoint.
Metaphors activate new
processes of
thinking.
How many metaphors do you see?!

Fascinating Power of Metaphor! A Stanford Study
Two groups are given reports to read on the outbreak of crime on a
ﬁctional city. One group was given reports that used the word beasts, describing crime as preying on the city.
The other group was given reports describing the crime using the word virus  that was
infecting the city.
These words were used only once in each report.
The groups were asked how they would handle the crime:
• The group that was exposed to the word beast suggested
handling the crime with vigorous police action- hunt down the
criminals.
• The other group exposed to the virus suggested handling the crime
with diagnosis, look for root causes.
All participants attributed their opinions to the statistics. And yet both
groups were exposed to the same statistics.

Coaching With Metaphor Tips
1.Listen to the client and understand the images they try to convey through
their use of metaphors.
2.Use the client’s metaphor to help them dive deeper into the situations they
discuss. For example, if the client has “hit a wall”, have them explain what the wall looks like, how tall it is, what it is made of and how they feel they might get to the other side of it.
3.If the client does not come up with a metaphor, try to provide one that could give insight into their mindset. For instance, talk about their situation in terms of being a ship on the ocean. Get them to describe visually what that looks like for them. What are the obstacles, what does the ship look like, what does their destination look like, etc.
4.Once they have a perspective on the metaphor, move forward to get to an action using the metaphor. The metaphors helps the client consciously focus on the situation with imagination using a story, symbol or object to change their viewpoint. Strategy for using metaphors when coaching:

Feelings
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Feelings vs thoughts
Feelings are emotions and sensations
that live in our bodies.
Thoughts are the meaning we make
of feelings.
Coaches question thoughts and feelings to create new
possibilities and opportunities for change.
This is important because:
Most people fall victim to thoughts & emotions!
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Sometimes “too simple” is overlooked…
Virtually all clients already know what the solutions
are to their problems.
So what gets in the way?
Feelings!
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
Ask “What?” not “How?”
Problem Obvious Solution What’s Underneath?
I can’t manage my time Prioritize I could prioritize, but I can
handle anything! What’s
the worst that could really
happen?
I don’t know what to do
about my careerTake logical stock of
your career and follow
the rational pathI could explore, research,
talk to people… but I’m
terrified of novelty and change
My boss is difficult Give your boss some
feedback on your experience of him; set
boundaries.I could give my boss
feedback, but what if I’m being too sensitive; and I’m
frighten of male authorities.
THRIVE!
T is the surface of the iceberg- let the ideas develop.
H is honing in and clarifying the goal
R is the opportunity to explore beneath the surface.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
But shouldn’t I know better?
Our emotions largely determine our actions. If we’re feeling something positive—
conﬁdence, optimism, contentment—we’ll come to one conclusion about what we ought to do.
If our emotions are negative—anxiety, anger, sadness—our decisions may be quite different, even though we’re working with the same set of facts.

Mindfulness & Awareness
Coaches help clients reveal important information
about how we’re responding to a situation.
I Feel… Tells me…
Anger Injustice
Disappointment Unmet expectations
Jealousy Threatened
Envy Wanting what others have
Fear Empeding danger
Joy Progress
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
When Feelings Are Thoughts
Ask a client how they feel, and
what you often get is a thought.
Sounds like: I feel like… this is complicated, impossible, or crazy….
Wait! These are not feelings!
When this happens, keep
probing:
And what does complicated feel like? How does it feel when you
say impossible?…
OR Ask…. What emotions come up for you as you say that?
