Abracadabra
Remember the magic of Mary Poppins?
Abracadabra typically conjures up images of
magic! But did you know…
 “abra” means “I will create”,
and “cadabra” means “as was spoken”?
We create (like magic) as we speak!

Words can change your brain!
“A single word has the power to inﬂuence the expression of
genes that regulate physical and emotional stress”.
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Dr. Andrew Newberg M.D.
It only takes ONE  negative word to:
•increase the activity in the amygdala (the fear centre
of the brain)
•release dozens of stress-producing hormones
•interrupt your brains’ functioning.
Especially with regard to logic, reason, and language!

Words & Beliefs
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Coaching & Language
Coaches raise awareness.
They call attention to habitual language.
Change your words. Change your feelings.
Change your life.
The English language contains 500,000 words.
Of those 500,000 words, about 3000 are used to describe emotions.
 The average person’s vocabulary consists of approx. 2,000 words–  0.004% of 500,000 words!
Our habitual vocabulary (words we use everyday by default) consists of approx. 300 words.
Of which 75% are words that describe negative emotions.

Listen for Limiting Beliefs
Words we use to describe our experience
actually become our experience!
Predicting the future This has never worked….or it will never work…
Mind reading I know what he/she/they must be thinking…
Catastrophising I’m never chosen…. I’m always overlooked…
Mental Filtering Everyone thinks I’ll fail…
Over Generalization I didn’t make it up that hill,  I won’t make it up this one either
Labelling (I AM) I am lazy / I am a failure / I am always right…..
Black or White thinking Good or bad…my way or no way…. all or nothing
Personalization It’s all my fault /  I’ll take the credit for that…
Emotional Reasoning Making excuses: I know he’s always late, he really can’t help it
Minimization Ya, I ran that marathon, but if I can do it anyone can

Life Lenses & World Views
Consider what lens your coachee is using.
Behind every limiting thought is the lens we see the
world through. The lens is often a theme revealed
by language.
Problem VS Possibility This will never work / There is always a way
Fear VS Love Love leads to suffering / love is joy and attracts more love
Scarcity VS Abundance I can’t afford that / I am grateful for what I have
Confusion VS Clarity What did I do to deserve this? / What am I responsible for?
Struggle VS Allowing Life is hard / Every day is a gift
Needy VS Resourceful I can’t do it alone / Where there is will, there is a way
Separation VS Unity Every man for himself/ It takes a community

What does it mean to raise awareness & responsibility?

ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Move from subjective to objective
Beliefs are ideas and principles considered to be
true that we no longer question.
Words reinforce beliefs. Beliefs guide behavior. Coaches examine the stories
coachees tell themselves
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification
Raise Awareness by
1.First listening for the limiting language
2.Then reflect back (I hear you saying…) 3.Then partner to create new choices
Example:
“I hear “should” (can’t, have to, must)…”
ASK:
What do you believe about yourself when you say that?
What do you actually want?

Reframing : 2mm Shifts
Shift from Passive to Active
Coachee: I really doubt that I can do anything about this
Coach: What’s one small step you can take?
Shift from Past to Future
Coachee: I’ve never been good at public speaking Coach: Who do you know who does it well?

Shift from Future to Past
Coachee: I’ll never finish this project.
Coach: When have you overcome a similar challenge?
Shift from a Liability to Asset
Coachee: I’m too much of a perfectionist- it’s driving me and
others crazy.
Coach: How does being a perfectionist serve you?
ICF Life & Wellness Coach Certification

Shift from Victim to Empowered
Coachee: My boss always dumps work on my desk at 5PM,
                  he should respect my time more!
Coach:     What’s within your control?
Shift from Narrow to Wide (context)
Coachee: This situation is really getting me down, I don’t
                  know what to do.
Coach:     How important will this be in a year from now?
