How do we get into ‘F low State’
Flow state
“Optimal state of consciousness.  Feel & perform
your best. Every thought follows inevitably from
the previous one, like playing jazz (or dancing in the moment). Your whole being is involved, and you are using your skills to the utmost.”
ICF Life & Wellness Coach
10 Steps to achieve Flow State
1.	Being clear about your goal as a coach
2.	Presence
3.	You enjoy what you are doing!
4.	Losing feelings of self-consciousness
5.	Feeling conﬁdent in the process
6.	Being in tune with your instincts
7.	Knowing that your skills align with your goal
8.	Feel like you can handle anything that comes
9.	Transcending awareness of your physical self
10.	You are completely immersed in the activity itself
These are the emotions and responses most often associated
with ﬂow state.Rate
yourself!

Debunking 10,000 hrs
The largest meta-analysis in the field  found that practice may be
responsible for as little
as 12% of mastery.
When you're conﬁdent about what you do and clear about
where you're going, the right strategy will make itself known.
When your "why" is strong, you'll ﬁgure out “how."
Quality vs quantity + practice hours Does it really take 10,000 hours for mastery?
Much research since 2014 has debunked the famous
Malcolm Gladwell claim in the 2008 book Outliers.

R & I in THRIVE
Reality
Move people from subjective (the story) to objective (what is
actually happening) to facilitate self-awareness and responsibility.
Introspection
Explore what might be holding a person back from moving
forward or towards what they want. Its the “what’s at risk” conversation.
Deﬁne the fear! What is the worst case scenario?
What can you do to prevent it?
What can you do to repair it?
What do you give up when you stay in fear?

Distorting Objectivity
The challenge for the coach is to listen past the
story. To question the perspective that inﬂuences
how the person sees the events or the situation.
